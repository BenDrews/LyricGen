( man , we gotta go get somethin' to eat
man , i'm hungry as a motherfucker )
ayo man , damn
what's takin' homie so long , son ?
( 50 , calm down , he coming )
*9 gunshots*
( ahh , ohh , what the fuck )
ah , son , pull off , pull off )
many men wish death upon me
blood in my eye , dawg , and i can't see
i'm tryin' to be what i'm destined to be
and niggas tryin' to take my life away
i put a hole in nigga for fuckin' with me
my back on the wall , now you gon' see
better watch how you talk when you talk about me
‘cause i'll come and take your life away
many men , many , many , many , many men
wish death 'pon me
lord , i don't cry no more
don't look to the sky no more
have mercy on me
now these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
go on and get your refund , motherfucker , i ain't dead
i'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
i'm the underground king and i ain't been crowned
when i rhyme somethin' special happen every time
i'm the greatest , somethin' like ali in his prime
i walk the block with the bundles
i've been knocked on the humble
swing the ox when i rumble , show your ass what my gun do
got a temper , nigga , go 'head , lose your head
turn your back on me , get clapped and lose your legs
i walk around gun on my waist , chip on my shoulder
'til i bust a clip in your face , pussy , this beef ain't over
many men , many , many , many , many men
wish death 'pon me
lord , i don't cry no more
don't look to the sky no more
have mercy on me
have mercy on my soul
somewhere my heart turned cold
have mercy on many men
many , many , many , many men
wish death upon me
sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
death gotta be easy , ‘cause life is hard
it'll leave you physically , mentally and emotionally scarred
this is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
for the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
i don't say " only god can judge me , " ‘cause i see things clear
crooked - ass crackers will give my black - ass a hundred years
i'm like paulie in goodfellas , you can call me the don
like malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
slim switched sides on me , let niggas ride on me
i thought we was cool , why you want me to die , homie ?
many men , many , many , many , many men
wish death 'pon me
lord , i don't cry no more
don't look to the sky no more
have mercy on me
have mercy on my soul
somewhere my heart turned cold
have mercy on many men
many , many , many , many men
wish death upon me
every night i talk to god , but he don't say nothin' back
i know he protectin' me , but i still stay with my gat
in my nightmares niggas keep pullin' tec's on me
psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
the feds didn't know much when pac got shot
i got a kite from the pens that told me tut got knocked
i ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
are you illiterate , nigga ? you can't read between the lines ?
in the bible it says what goes around comes around
" hommo " shot me , three weeks later he got shot down
now it's clear that i'm here for a real reason
‘cause he got hit like i got hit , but he ain't fuckin' breathin'
many men , many , many , many , many men
wish death 'pon me
lord , i don't cry no more
don't look to the sky no more
have mercy on me
have mercy on my soul
somewhere my heart turned cold
have mercy on many men
many , many , many , many men
wish death upon me
