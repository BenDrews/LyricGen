yeah , uh - huh
they don't do it how we do
niggas ain’t on the shit we on ( we on , we on )
everything new
spikes on the louboutins ( boutins , boutins )
i'm 'round the bullshit like a matador
i’m used to the bullshit , it don’t matter boy
corporate acquisitions , accumulations of wealth
build with the gods and double knowledge of self
entrepreneur visions , moulin rouge religion
that pussy make a weak nigga break down
so which you want , the cheese or the cheeks
you want the cheeks but she want the cheese , a bitch gotta eat
i’m havin’ the epiphany you niggas ain’t shit to me
worse than the scum in the slum i’m from
i’m a southside nigga , yeah i’m ‘bout mine

you ain’t made of what i’m made of
you a bum nigga with a bum bitch , her shoes come from bakers
counterfeit , fraudulent fakers

brake hit the button then we pulling , down the top
shine’s on stuntin’ and i’m pullin’ out a knot
strapped with the glock won’t pull it out a lot but front , i’ll make it pop

niggas ain’t on the shit we on ( we on , we on )
everything new
spikes on the louboutins ( boutins , boutins )

visualize everything i needed and dream ( uh - huh )
penalized every ho nigga that have a scheme ( what else ? )
guns in your video get you locked in a bing

murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up
charity work , parking tickets and no charges
fuck nigga you fucked over your father when he gave you a dick
should have been a bitch in pajamas
i made my first million fucking dollars
bought a bible , oh yeah , god got me
made my second million dollars , bought a chopper and a binocular
i'm scared , this shit don't happen to everybody
i'm on instagram looking at your favorite singer
debating on should i fuck her or jump on her single
20 thou , she got a hell of a adlib
i'm in her mouth like i knew i could have kids , k - dot
good pussy for dinner , bomb kush for breakfast
d colored vs stones around my neck bitch
it feels like a nigga dreamin’
seat back , music bumpin’ , niggas leanin’
bulls eye , that’s what we came for
the bread , now a nigga run the game boy
i should’ve sent the broad to report what’s in the yard
aloof livin’ , i came up so hard
no pain , no gain , it’s embedded in the brain
i’m in it for the grip , motherfuck the fame
‘round the world tourin’ , the city got boring
bury me a g with a new pair of jordans
coupe foreign , top peeled like an orange
blue ferrari , so many iron horses
living life with no worries
my gun got a zodiac sign , it's a taurus
don't make it slam on you like amar'e
m - zone rida gang end the story

she call me daddy too , we should be on maury
everything you aren't , fly nigga soaring
purple label ralph lauren , kick game like atari
