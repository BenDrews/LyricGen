lord forgive me , for i've sinned
over and over again just to stay on top
i recall memories , filled with sin
over and over , again and again
when you hear talk of the southside , you hear talk of the team
see , niggas feared prince and respected preme
for all you slow motherfuckers , i'mma break it down iller
see , preme was the business man and prince was the killer
remember , he used to push the bulletproof bm , uh huh
his hair'll get you seasick , i sat back and peeped shit
the roll with e - z wider and they ain't get blunted
had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
as a youth , all i ever did was sell crack
i used to idolize cat
hurt me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on pap
how he go out like that ?
rumors in the hood was just was snitching
i ain't believe that , pa , he helped me cop my first gsxr
had the 4 - runner , the z , the 5 and the 3
used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
from gerald wallace to baby wise , don't be surprised
of how freely i throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
like la and wise , l got shot in the neck , then told his connect
them niggas who shot them got 'em for 10 bricks
fucking dominicans , turned around and gave 'em more bricks
that first verse is just a dose of the shit that i'm on
consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's qu'ran
i know a lot of niggas that get dough like bimmy and joe
and prince and righteous from hillside with the mole on his nose
throughout my struggles in the hood , i started learning
life's a bitch with a pretty face , but she burning
man i'm a get cheese like chaz then run through whips like cigar
gamble all the time like country - curly head prince and tah - tah
po - po under pressure too , they know what they facing
go against crews like bebo and killers like pappy mason
a lot of niggas i know been corrupted since birth
enticed to rob nuns for fun , for everything they worth
i know some cats that held down whole complexes like corley wall
together niggas stand and divided they fall
round here , shook niggas they keep it in motion
come around here with your roley , you can get robbed like ocean
lord knows , tommy had laurelton sold
helicopters , rolls royces with louis vuitton interior
might sound like i'm fantasizing , but son i'm dead serious
montana was no dummy , brought business to wash the money
had money out the ass , he politic like the asian
feds couldn't catch him dirty , so settled for tax evasion
rest in peace to rich and ron , money what they was about , yo
the twins was from queens but got crazy cream with alpo
throughout my time i heard tales of himey , frenchy
jamaican pauly , duckie corley
ronnie bumps and chick... shit
a lot a niggas flow the way i flow
but ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who i know
writing rhymes is the best way i express how i feel
if i ain't rich by 26 , i'll be dead or in jail
coming up i heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
and if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose
i'm forgetting lefty and jazz , pretty tony and lance
head lou , mel son , troy and e money bags
in a conversation over shrimp and lobster
at benihana's , heard chico stopped boxing , and started robbing diners
shout out to clarence and clutch , bob dre , black will
if the flow don't kill you the mac will
