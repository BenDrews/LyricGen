they ask me what i think about the competition
and i say “no , i couldn’t care less about the team strugglin'
i wanna kiss you”
new tigallo , new tigallo , new tigallo
tigallo and 9th wonder , maybe
we got yo girl undulating
to the rhythm of the drum
wet t - shirt lookin’ like a vacation
take it off like monday , baby
and there will be no underrating
so please hold your applause
let it bump a little up in your cars
they say that boy’s back
nigga , this is blackboard rap
you can gon’ chalk it up to a loss
and if you got a problem with it , walk it up to the boss
and get your card pulled like pitty pat
body a verse and put it in a pine box
you niggas can get a fuckin’ shine box , billy batts
and really that’s all my time , this is the last chapter
you x and y , we off the damn axis
intricate , me and 9th , two of god’s instruments
and when we get together you can call it band practice
men of action , they hustle bass ackwards
penny for your thoughts kid , miss me with that rappin’
sho nuff , i am like the master
see the glow what , grown up , i am that then
i am passion , two parts magic
sprinkle in authentic , simmer with a little madness
got a vendetta for the magistrate
catch you in the world plain clothes , ain’t no tellin’ what’ll happen
that would be entrapment
please , the audacity and casualty of crassness
i am absent minded for i am past it
fry a fish much bigger for the inquisitive jurassic
picture moby dick , hold a flick , don’t miss it
may sank your ship , ahab iddish
you need arab benjamins when payin’ close attention to the mentionings
i too have brought an instrument for i’ve always known that they were listenin’
