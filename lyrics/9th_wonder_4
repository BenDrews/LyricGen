fly love song , fly love song
dream of a land , my soul is from
i hear a hand , stroke on a drum
shades of delight , cocoa hue
rich as the night , afro blue
elegant boy , beautiful girl
dancing for joy , delicate whirl
shades of delight cocoa hue
rich as the night , afro blue
two lovers are face to face with undulating grace
they gently sway and slip away to some secluded place
shades of delight , cocoa hue
rich as the night , afro blue
new tigallo , new tigallo
yo , you came to me as my blessing
i'm trying to accept it and not question
the whys and the hows without ob - sessing
it's a lot to think about , i'm still processing
tears of joy in the morning made our pillow wet
then night fell and we turned into silhouettes
your body next to mine dancing real close
step left , step right , then a pirouette
it would appear as that we really do believe in us
but it's so hard to believe all we need is us
believe a kiss on a cold day could be enough
look at the stars and wonder what it is they see in us
where is this leading us ? that's all i'm asking
love comes in every color , but the fact is
i never needed fifty shades of grey
just turn the lights down low and give me every shade of blackness , uh...
two lovers are face to face with undulating grace
gently sway and slip away to some secluded place
shades of delight , cocoa hue
rich as the night , afro blue
