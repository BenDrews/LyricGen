never stop loving you , hehe !
ey , what's happenin y'all ? yeah
it's terrace martin and my homeboy , 9th wonder
brought to you live from devi terrace tuesdays
yeah , you
excuse me miss lovable , i don't mean to trouble you
your bubble's so beautiful , got it from your mother too
that night at the w , ball when i discover you
made me wanna fix all your problems , now let me troubleshoot
in all actuality , your mentality dwarfed your attributes
personality as sweet as passion fruit
conversation casual but quickly turn to marital
i am hip - hop but i'm not your average rapper dude
there's more to me , i never call you shorty cause there's more to you
you priceless , them other chicks affordable
i'm callin you adorable , every chance i get in the recordin booth
in bed , barely audible , you wonder who i'm talkin to
heh.. we whisperin the sweet nothings
back when i was single , i had the streets buzzing
now i need you to complete my album
cause you my partner and it's hard for me to be without you
never stop loving you ( uh , never stop , never stop )
never gonna stop , never gonna stop , never gonna
i'll never stop , never stop , no !
i had a dream that you would come and you'd complete my life
back when i was younger , i would wonder if i need a wife
mentally recorded as important what i need to say
and back in the days with cds and cassettes made by tdk
the vinyl was spinnin , you was winnin with the 8 - track
ya momma had a dodge dart , way before the maybachs
and the mercedes golf cart , i gamble like a card shark
hit her with the wizardry , defense against the dark arts
wrote a song about it , wanna hear it ? i got a lot to say
modify ya spotify , play me through your dr. dre's
you got the juice now , fresh not from concentrate
your embrace warmer than a goose down from dr. jays
the winter of my discontent , this is what you spring for
you'd wonder where the summer went , stop preparin for the fall
see it really don't matter what the season is
you like my breathing , i never leave it cause i need to live
