this how i'm living , the only time i'm looking you in the eye
if we doin' business
i got ray ban vision
i'm back up in this , feelin tremendous lenses darker than the tint on my benzes
i got ya bitch flippin like a gymnast
she told me take my glasses off but she looks horrendous
caravans on my face lookin vintage , 3 pair of these bitch , cost what your rent is
niggas wasn't wearin these , now it's a trend shit
i had my first pair of ray bans when i was ten tricks
prynce is lookin like a pilot out the air force
came to the club fresh up out the airport
i'm like tom cruise i'm from top gun ( why ? )
cause they know that's where i'm at , plus i got one
i keep my shades on in the hot sun
old school datsun , stunt so hard it's not fuuunny
i'm with the playboy bunny and she's still a dime
even when her hair is not done
i got ray ban vision , these ain't no prescriptions
i see you haters coming niggas don't think that i'm slippin'
i got ray ban vision , i wear 'em when i'm whippin'
i wear 'em when i'm fucking all my women think i'm trippin'
i got ray ban vision

this how i'm living , the only time i'm looking you in the eye
if we doin' business
i got ray ban vision
i seen it all through the mirror tints
i knew a girl who is innocent with just a few friends
i got my hand in between her legs
she says boy go ahead , gonna make me have a incident
now we intimate , this is how we ended it
left the restaurant now i'm in her mouth like a dinner mint
we started in a parking lot and finish at my teniment
shorty had a reason , my pimpin' was legitimate
i tore that pussy up like a ligament
she don't like her man so she asked me for deliverance
i sit back with my ray bans on
i say it ain't my fault that you in that predicament
cause i treat hoes like ray charles
looks ain't shit , that's how i play ball
as long as they take off they draws
and the whole time we did it i didn't take my shades off
i got ray ban vision , these ain't no prescriptions
i see you haters coming niggas don't think that i'm slippin'
i got ray ban vision , i wear 'em when i'm whippin'
i wear 'em when i'm fucking all my women think i'm trippin'
i got ray ban vision

this how i'm living , the only time i'm looking you in the eye
if we doin' business
i got ray ban vision

i got ray ban vision , these ain't no prescriptions
i see you haters coming niggas don't think that i'm slippin'
