i used to idolize you
put you on a pedestal
next to you
i was totally invisible
you’re only human , human like me
you’re not so special after all
you’re only human
even the highest fall
we all fall down
we all fall down down
we all fall down
we all fall down , down
we all fall down
we all fall down , down
we all fall down
we all fall down , down
i used to worship you
to me you were untouchable
next to you , i was totally invisible
you’re only human , human like me
you’re not so special after all
you’re only human
even the highest fall
we all fall down
we all fall down down
we all fall down
we all fall down , down
we all fall down
we all fall down , down
we all fall down
we all fall down , down
we all fall down
i had pictures of you
watching over me
it had to be you
all i wanted to be
i had pictures of you
watching over me
i was trapped in a spell
until at last i can see
we all fall down
we all fall down down
we all fall down
we all fall down , down
we all fall down
we all fall down , down
we all fall down
we all fall down , down
we all fall down
the walls , the walls !
fall down
even the mountains !
fall down
all of our heroes
fall down
you know , you know
fall
