let down , a light that flickers off in the basement
let down , tonight i feel my courage breaking
i made a mess of easy stuff
i care too much , don't care enough
i wrestle with my attitude
you're mad at me , i'm tired of you
( chorus )
and it's a horrible thing to push , push , push , push love away
yeah it's a horrible thing to push , push , push , push love away
baby , be with you , baby , baby , be with you , baby , just think , to be
baby , be with you , baby , baby , be with you , baby , just think , to be
let down , i feel your disconnect emotion
let down , you stand there cold and proud like i'm not your man
and i feel trapped , and gave my word
not to hang out with other girls
i made you feel like i'm all yours
but i can't stop myself on tours
( chorus )
it's such a horrible thing to push , push , push , push love away
yeah it's a horrible thing to push , push , push , push love away
baby , be with you , baby , baby , be with you , baby just think , to be
baby , be with you , baby , baby , be with you , baby just think , to be
baby , be with you , baby , baby , be with you , baby just think , to be
it's such a horrible thing to push , push , push , push love away
yeah it's a horrible thing to push , push , push , push love away
baby , be with you , baby , baby , be with you , baby just think , to be
baby , be with you , baby , baby , be with you , baby just think , to be
baby , be with you , baby , baby , be with you , baby just think , to be
baby , be with you , baby , baby , be with you , baby just think , to be
baby , be with you , baby , baby , be with you , baby just think , to be
baby , be with you , baby , baby , be with you , baby just think , to be
