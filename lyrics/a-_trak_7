do you sometimes let your hand slip away ?
something just feels different about you babe
don't wanna hear about your crazy drunk night out
i don't believe that you just passed out on the couch
i can see it , something in the way you move
you're acting like thereâ€™s something left to prove
and all these lies they keep on slippin' out
i said i don't believe that you just passed out on the couch
on and on and on it goes
on and on and on it goes
cause i've been nothing but good to you
your howlin' into the night won't do
i'm tired of talking , talking , talking , talking
i've been nothing but good to you
every moment my heart went all black and cold
nothing stings as much like never knowing
what you've been up to , whose bed you're crashing now
i wanna get rid of the feeling , turn it all around
get out the door and disappear
when you get home i won't be here
don't act surprised as if you cared
cause i've been nothing but good to you
your howlin' into the night won't do
i'm tired of talking , talking , talking , talking
i've been nothing but good to you
