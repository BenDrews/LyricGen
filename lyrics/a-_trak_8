you were always on the other side
running in parallel lines
you and i cannot collide
running in parallel lines
parallel lines
running in parallel lines
i can see for miles
i can see the dark heart of your silhouette
calling me
calling me
i can disappear
just like a memory
everything i wanted is above me
and i’m falling down
your heavy sky
your sunset eyes are burning me
the harder i try the further i pull away from
you were always on the other side
running in parallel lines
you and i cannot collide
running in parallel lines
parallel lines
running in parallel lines
lines , lines , lines , lines
so tell me what to do
i’m a spaceman lost in a black hole
don’t know where i’m gonna go
tell me what you hear
just like my memory
everyone around me is a star and they’re all burning out
your heavy sky
your sunset eyes are burning me
the harder i try the further i pull away from
you were always on the other side
running in parallel lines
you and i cannot collide
running in parallel lines
parallel lines
running in parallel lines
lines , lines , lines , lines
