my sneakers more cleaner than yours , more meaner , more cleaner than yours
i got it mastered ( mastered )
and my car go faster
85 an hour i'm about to take them backwards
yea , now that's back to the essence
the freshest , prince is in your presence
the uniform on backwards
the fnf will f 'em
it's a laster , went to a thrower from a crasher
( ooh ) , now while that's flowing right passed ya
let me take a second to add up all the factors
a - trak on the track , and lupe is the rapper
man about town , proud member of swagger
supreme world attention getting , glisten
ever resistant to anything non - pimping or wacker
i'm much flyer , united , i'm nasa
i'm much higher , not a puffer i'm a passer
not a rusher or a tackler
i ain't gotta cuffer or a tagger
like i'm a graffer , or rhasta
i grinds , i should make the cover of thrasher
chilling with the cover of king ( ya i - i - i'm mean )
take a second , you need to breathe
give me a minute , i need to breathe
excuse me man , i can't see
cause you in my way
so i'm on it like i own it
it sounds like it don't it , i do
and do to the fact that i'm up on it , they opponent
but they don't want to turn the flyness , into bird flu
and serve you a nice pot of bird stew
i'm breaking down my bread like i'm making bird food
and i'll be in the stu' , like i'm a bird too
but i just fly , like a bird do
i doodoo on the birds , man , i'm high enough to dew
though , i'm sitting on the wires and admiring the view
i can still relate to the tires and the shoes
dropping shows for their soles/souls
patches for their innertubes
and i run flat while you're running your trap
i come through , take your cheddar , take your feather , take your blue
then leave behind a letter , i'm addressing it to you
you need to build it better for the veterans , salute cause
