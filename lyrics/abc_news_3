tuff
i was with him the whole time. i had a teacher that come in and our cafeteria manager came in. i kind of walked him through it and talked to him and told him it was okay , that we all have situations in our lives and i just went through a tragedy myself but i recovered from it and so it was going to be okay. if i can recover and open up a business , he could too.
sawyer

i told him to lay on the floor and then i told the police that he was giving himself up. i just talked him through it.
