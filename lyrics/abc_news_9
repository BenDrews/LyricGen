foreign minister julie bishop has described the shelling of three united nations schools sheltering civilians in gaza as " indefensible " , saying australia wants a full investigation.
ms bishop's comments came on the eve of a mooted three - day ceasefire , scheduled to start later today with the backing of both israel and palestinian groups.
this afternoon israel said it would pull all of its ground forces out of gaza before the beginning of the ceasefire , due to start at 8 : 00am local time ( 3 : 00pm aest ) .
gaza officials say the war has killed 1 , 834 palestinians , most of them civilians.
israel says 64 of its soldiers and three civilians have been killed since fighting began on july 8 after a surge in cross - border rocket salvos from gaza.
