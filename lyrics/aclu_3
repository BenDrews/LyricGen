what we saw on tuesday , as terrible as it is , could be minuscule if , in fact , god continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of america to give us probably what we deserve.
that’s my feeling. i think we’ve just seen the antechamber to terror. we haven’t even begun to see what they can do to the major population.
the aclu has got to take a lot of the blame for this. and i know i’ll hear from them on this , but throwing god successfully , with the help of the federal court system , throwing god out of the public square , out of the schools…
the abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because god will not be mocked , and when we destroy 40 million little innocent babies , we make god mad.
i really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle , the aclu , people for the american way , all of them who try to secularize america , i point the finger in their face and say , ‘you helped this happen.’
i totally concur.
