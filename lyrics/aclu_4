before this happen to me i thought the death penalty was for the worst of the worst. i didn't think anyone innocent was there , because i thought there would be overwhelming evidence. 3 1/2 years on death row , i know different. i grew to know some good people on death row in alabama. some of them did not commit the crime , like me. some were in the wrong place but didn't kill anyone. some may have committed a bad crime , but they were not cold - hearted or selfish. some were there because their lawyers were not seasoned. some because the judge overrode the jury.
the solitary confinement on death row was terrible. i still try not to think about it too much. the cell is 8 feet long 6 feet wide with 8 foot ceilings. i was locked inside 23 or 24 hours a day. i have short arms but i can touch both walls at the same time. there was a suicide while i was there , a man who had been on death row about 16 years. i know that being on solitary was part of his suicide. if you are not mentally strong , it breaks you down. all the way down.
* there were 17 executions while i was there. i knew them , i know every name and they day they were executed.
* no matter what , i know that the death penalty is wrong. it is a completely broken system !
sincerely ,
