“when a soldier who shared information with the press and public is punished far more harshly than others who tortured prisoners and killed civilians , something is seriously wrong with our justice system. "

" these numbers are out of proportion ; this sentence , given all we know about manning and what he did ( and what was done to him ) , is a strikingly harsh one.
manning gave hundreds of thousands of classified war logs and diplomatic cables to wikileaks. he also gave them a video , filmed from an apache helicopter , of american forces firing on people in the streets of baghdad with what manning , according to his testimony , took to be heartbreaking blitheness. he was already pretty torn up , hardly more than twenty years old , realizing he was gay , wondering if he should have been born a woman , in the middle of a war zone. he thought , his lawyer argued in the trial , that he might save someone , or everyone. however one measures that choice , one of the scandals of this court martial was how the government cast aside manning’s own gestures of contrition. he offered to plead guilty to enough counts to put him in prison for twenty years. the prosecutors pressed on , insisting on trying him under the espionage act and for “aiding the enemy.” ( i’ve written about that decision before. ) on that last count , which was novel in this sort of case and would have set a disastrous precedent for press freedom , manning was acquitted. but the espionage act charges are broadly damaging , too.
