la musica de harry fraud
smoke something , biatch !
blow a kiss to my dick , wash my body with the sponge
feed me fla - vor - ices , put the chronic in my lungs
tailor me a leather suit , on some jodeci shit
bi - coastal man , we both will﻿ be rich
leave the party with your daughter ( little debra )
in the morning do karate in the water
hear sounds of samurais
rockin shorts in the winter don’t fuck with splinters ( rats )
roll with sinners — a bunch of winners , catered lunch and dinners
why my drug jar look so empty ?
drop a hook and then i’ll probably cop an m3
long knife ( 'chete ) , that’s in the event
somebody try to get me then to heaven they’ll be sent
oh , off the strength , caviar and porsche taste
all the beans are gettin' boston baked
on thin ice , i skate across the lake
with the ccm tacks , my feet are like cassius
smoke premium cabbage
yo we 80 , 000 shopping malls but we ain't browsin'
poppin' hood in transco towers
prowler prowling gucci towels and bathroom vials
nouns , owls , aston martins
sparkin' one in valet parkin' , loan sharkin'
hopin' that my days - don’t - get - darkened
cheetah skin outside the parka
propaganda propels us – ostrich feathers
security guards with 9 berettas , pullin' up volkswagen jettas
causin' storms in sunny weather , in sunny whether , in sunny weather
hopin' that my days get , hopin' , hopin' days get , days get better
