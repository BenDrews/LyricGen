what up , love ? i need a hug cause drugs be takin' over
shorty couldn't take it no more , she went loca
no stranger to a rum and soda
i met the ho while she was slumped over
shit , i've been good , though , i can't complain
i could probably cop a half a plane
drinking juice just like jack lalanne now
i'mma strike it rich any day now
uh , you know i gotta get a plate now
virtuoso on a keyboard
i rep the eastern seaboard , jeez lord
please leave the z3 keys before you leave
don't sneeze on my shit , cause for shiz i'mma flip ya
pedicured foot slide in the slipper
tryna do the remix with pitbull
tell the pilot land at schiphol
play the violin with dimples
life's ironic and it's simple
smoke good , fuck , eat , drink
drive nice car , wear all green mink
first time i whacked off was a penthouse
roses in the bath at the penthouse
billy joel at the garden
should i get a skybox or an '89 iroc ?
it's always poppin' at the ihop
choke a pussy with his tie knot , it's my block
chuck knoblauch , spicy coconut curry from the thai spot
i'm in a hurry , dumb jewelry
the verdict read from a hung jury
the doctor said that i was hung early
skull curly , larry , and moe , i'll marry a ho
only if the bitch look like mari' monroe
twisted off the jenkem , watching iron chef
the secret ingredient was lion's neck
royal blue - cyber tech
i ride solo like a fighter jet
hurt me again
no , don't hurt me again
please , don't hurt me again
no , don't hurt me again
there's no hit records on a demo
there's no hit records on a demo
