adam mansbach : there's a famous story about him having a drum battle with - - is it john bonham ? is that the cat ?
brian viglione : from led zeppelin ?
am : yeah
bv : yeah , sure
am : yeah. this is documented in the liner notes to the impulse elvin jones , there's a two - record set , if you've ever seen it , on impulse. there's a whole series of them. they did an ahmad jamal one. they do these two - record sets , and they're excerpts from different songs , different album , you know ?
bv : yeah
am : and the liner notes to this detail how elvin gave an interview to downbeat , one of those blindfold tests , in like '69 , and inadvertently disses john bonham - - i'm pretty sure it was john bonham. they play him some shit and elvin's quote is something like , " he needs to lose his ass in space , cause he ain't playing shit "
and somehow , this got back to bonham. i guess they were friends , i don't know. they end up having this battle in london , in some big hall , balconies , standing room only. and bonham shows up with some huge set , some big - ass rock set with fifteen different kinds of splash cymbals. elvin's got the four - piece joint , and blows him the fuck away. the end
