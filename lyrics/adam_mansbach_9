adam mansbach : blake lethem , yeah. keo. tc5. scotch79. shout out to him. he did the cover , he did the cover of the mixtape. he did the illuminated letters inside the book. and he was a valuable source for me when i was writing the book , as were a lot of other writers , from part1 to phase2 to zephyr to alan ket to bomb5. i mean , i couldn't have written the book without the access that i had to these guys - - not just in the writing process , but over the last twenty years
