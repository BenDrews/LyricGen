and everybody know the story of david and goliath
but this is bigger than triumph
this is for the warrior , this is for you and i
this is for euphoria , give me a piece of mind
god is recording this , won't you look in the sky ?
tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
even when stability's never in your favor
fly with the turbulence , only last a minute
land on your dreams , and recognize you live it
walk through the valley and peaks , with bare feet
run through the flames , that's more passion for me
i passed testimony just so the world can see
my battle wounds on me , you watching me lick â€˜em clean
i know , i know , my pride , my goals , my highs , my lows
i know , i know , it's mind control
i know i could prosper , no impostor , prosecute my posture
i stand up and i stand by ya , what ?
i am a freedom fighter , the name that history wrote
and even through disaster , eye of the tiger for hope
i'm trying to find my way back , there's no day off for heroes
and even when i'm tired , go is the only word i know
and the night is takin' over , and the moonlight gets exposure
and the players have been chosen , and it seems like fate has spoken
when it seems your faith has broken , by the second , losin' focus
ain't no way to get off , get off , get off , get off
unless you move forward
i bet they wonder how i go on , go on
i'll simply say " it's on again , it's on again , " whoa - oh
the world don't stop , it's on again , it's on again , whoa - oh
i am a lonely hero , trying to fight my battles
life likes to blow the cold wind , sometimes it freezes my shadow
in the midst of all this darkness , i sacrifice my ego
there ain't no room for selfish , we do it for the people
and the night is takin' over , and the moonlight gets exposure
and the players have been chosen , and it seems like fate has spoken
ain't no way to get off , get off , get off , get off
i bet they wonder how i go on , go on
i'll simply say " it's on again , it's on again , " whoa - oh
the world don't stop , it's on again , it's on again , whoa - oh
say the work don't stop , cause they don't stop
and everybody here tryna get on top
everybody from the burbs down to the block
gotta hold on tight and don't let go , let go
huh , so you think you hot ?
gotta grind hard , give it all you got
you can have , or you can have not
you see that a lot in the ghetto , ghetto
i bet they wonder how i go on , go on
i bet they wonder how i go on , go on
i'll simply say " it's on again , it's on again , " whoa - oh
the world don't stop , it's on again , it's on again , whoa - oh
