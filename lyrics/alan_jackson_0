the sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow
an' so am i
work day passes like molasses in wintertime
but it's july
i'm gettin' paid by the hour , an' older by the minute
my boss just pushed me over the limit
i'd like to call him somethin'
i think i'll just call it a day
pour me somethin' tall an' strong
make it a " hurricane " before i go insane
it's only half - past twelve but i don't care
it's five o'clock somewhere
oh , this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon
an' half the night
tomorrow mornin' , i know there'll be hell to pay
hey , but that's all right
i ain't had a day off now in over a year
our jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
hit the 'phones for me
you can tell 'em i just sailed away
i could pay off my tab , pour myself in a cab
an' be back to work before two
at a moment like this , i can't help but wonder
what would jimmy buffet do ?
funny you should ask that because i'd say :
pour me somethin' tall an' strong
make it a " hurricane " before i go insane
it's only half - past twelve but i don't care
pour me somethin' tall an' strong
make it a " hurricane " before i go insane
