well way down yonder on the chattahoochee
it gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
we laid rubber on the georgia asphalt
we got a little crazy but we never got caught
down by the river on a friday night
a pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
talking about cars and dreaming about women
never had a plan just a living for the minute
yeah way down yonder on the chattahoochee
never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
but i learned how to swim and i learned who i was
a lot about living and a little about love
well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
i was willing but she wasn't ready
so a settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
i dropped her off early but i didn't go home
down by the river on a friday night
a pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
talking about cars and dreaming about women
never had a plan just a living for the minute
yeah way down yonder on the chattahoochee
never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
but i learned how to swim and i learned who i was
