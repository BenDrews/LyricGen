hey , you were standing by the screen door slamming
rather clear what's taking place
you were holding onto louie
he was packin' , he was heavy
that plastic handle just about to break
well then you picked up chloe
she knew y'all were going
she started barking like a tank
i was shocked and i was joking
but i will not be lonely
cause i got jim and jack and hank
take your string bikinis , your apple martinis
take what's left there in the bank
take your flat iron and your curlers
your sparkling water and that damn perfume i never liked
take your black mercedes , all that stuff for ladies
to me you're just a total blank
go on and leave me baby , i don't need you
i got jim and jack and hank
well now you left screaming and your tires screeching
that little dog right in your lap
i became a little sad and called up my ol' dad
he said , " son you just woke me from my nap "
i told him you had left me
he said , " son now don't you hate me
you know exactly what i think
you know you're better off , you can fish and you can golf
you still got jim and jack and hank "
take your string bikinis , your apple martinis
take what's left there in the bank
take your flat iron and your curlers
your sparkling water and that damn perfume i never liked
take your black mercedes , all that stuff for ladies
to me you're just a total blank
go on and leave me baby , i don't need you
i got jim and jack and hank , that's right
so i got out the whiskey and i began to listen to the songs
out in my truck you couldn't crank
i started feeling empty , then again it hit me
i've got jim and jack and hank
take your string bikinis , your apple martinis
take what's left there in the bank
take your flat iron and your curlers
your sparkling water and that damn perfume i never liked
take your black mercedes , all that stuff for ladies
to me you're just a total blank
go on and leave me baby , i don't need you
i got jim and jack and hank
yeah now , go on and leave me baby
i don't need you
i got jim and jack and hank
that's right , you go ahead , i'll be a - ok , cause i got jose
captain morgan , not to mention ol' old george and tammy
and loretta , merle , willie nelson , big john cash
how about old jimmy buffett ?
bring him in there when that sun's shining
george strait , an old friend
can't forget hank jr. and all his rowdy friends
i'm gonna clean out the whole closet baby
oh yeah
goodbye
