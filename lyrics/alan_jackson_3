remember when i was young and so were you
and time stood still and love was all we knew
you were the first , so was i
we made love and then you cried
remember when
remember when we vowed the vows
and walked the walk
gave our hearts , made the start , it was hard
we lived and learned , life threw curves
there was joy , there was hurt
remember when
remember when old ones died and new were born
and life was changed , disassembled , rearranged
we came together , fell apart
and broke each other's hearts
remember when
remember when the sound of little feet
was the music
we danced to week to week
brought back the love , we found trust
vowed we'd never give it up
remember when
remember when thirty seemed so old
now lookn' back it's just a steppin' stone
to where we are
where we've been
said we'd do it all again
remember when
remember when we said when we turned gray
when the children grow up and move away
we won't be sad , we'll be glad
for all the life we've had
and we'll remember when
