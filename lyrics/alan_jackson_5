spread your wings , don't be afraid to try
the world can be hard , you gotta live a little 'fore you die
so open that door , step out in the bright sunshine
follow your heart , and remember any time
you can always come home
wherever life's road leads , you can get back
to a love that's strong and free
you never be alone , in your heart there's still a place
no matter how right or wrong you've gone
you can always come home
so pack your bags , smile and say goodbye
and chase those dreams , and when you lay down and die
you know that there's someone praying for you every day
even if you never find your way
you can always come home
wherever life's road leads , you can get back
to a love that's strong and free
you never be alone , in your heart there's still a place
no matter how right or wrong you've gone
you can always come home
when i was young , my daddy said to me
the very same words and i took those words with me
when i was afraid , i'd pull them out and think
just how much they mean to me
you can always come home
wherever life's road leads , you can get back
to a love that's strong and free
you never be alone , in your heart there's still a place
no matter how right or wrong you've gone
you can always come home
