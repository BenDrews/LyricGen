i was born on the dixie highway , red clay and georgia pines
i was raised on the dixie highway , no sweeter place you’ll ever find
wood frame house and gravel driveway
willow trees and old front porch
just outside the city limits , on the highway 34
i was born on the dixie highway , red clay and georgia pines
i was raised on the dixie highway , no sweeter place you’ll ever find
and having tobacco growing on the roadside
rolled it up and we smoked it down
don’t do much , but it makes you feel big
when you’re ten years old in a tiny town
i was born on the dixie highway , red clay and georgia pines
i was raised on the dixie highway , no sweeter place you’ll ever find
have a chicken pen right in the backyard
clothes line running east to west
butter bean and tomato garden , six days and a sunday rest
i was born on the dixie highway , red clay and georgia pines
i was raised on the dixie highway , no sweeter place you’ll ever find
summertime , hot and hazy , bare feet and a water hose
melon rind on a country table
lightning bugs when the sun goes down
i was born on the dixie highway , red clay and georgia pines
i was raised on the dixie highway , no sweeter place you’ll ever find
and the holy ghost on a sunday morning
gospel songs and a bible read
sunday lunch at momma’s table , thank the lord and break the bread
i was born on the dixie highway , red clay and georgia pines
i was raised on the dixie highway , no sweeter place you’ll ever find
screened in porch right at the backdoor
washing machine and an old wood stove
momma’s singing in the kitchen , rolling homemade biscuit dough
i was born on the dixie highway , red clay and georgia pines
i was raised on the dixie highway , no sweeter place you’ll ever find
when i’m old and heaven’s calling
and they come to carry me away
just lay me down , down in south land
bury me in the georgia clay
i was born on the dixie highway , red clay and georgia pines
i was raised on the dixie highway , no sweeter place you’ll ever find
