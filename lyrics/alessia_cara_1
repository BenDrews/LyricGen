waiting for the time to pass you by
hope the winds of change will change your mind
i could give a thousand reasons why
and i know you , and you've got to
make it on your own , but we don't have to grow up
we can stay forever young
living on my sofa , drinking rum and cola
underneath the rising sun
i could give a thousand reasons why
but you're going , and you know that
all you have to do is stay a minute
just take your time
the clock is ticking , so stay
all you have to do is wait a second
your hands on mine
the clock is ticking , so stay
all you have to do is
all you have to do is stay
won't admit what i already know
i've never been the best at letting go
i don't wanna spend the night alone
guess i need you , and i need to
make it on my own , but i don't wanna grow up
we can stay forever young
living on my sofa , drinking rum and cola
underneath the rising sun
i could give a million reasons why
but you're going , and you know that
all you have to do is stay a minute
just take your time
the clock is ticking , so stay
all you have to do is wait a second
your hands on mine
the clock is ticking , so stay
all you have to do is
all you have to do is stay
all you have to do is stay
so stay , yeah
all you have to do is stay a minute
just take your time
the clock is ticking , so stay
all you have to do is wait a second
your hands on mine
the clock is ticking , so stay
all you have to do is stay
