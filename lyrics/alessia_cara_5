some nerve you have
to break up my lonely
and tell me you want me
how dare you march into my heart
oh how rude of you
to ruin my miserable
and tell me i’m beautiful
cause i wasn’t looking for love no
nobody asked you to get me attached to you
in fact you tricked me
and i wasn’t trying to fall in love but boy you pushed me
so all that i’m asking
is that you handle me with caution
cause i don’t give myself often
but i guess i’ll try today
cause i’ve had my heart
broken before
and i promised i would never let me hurt anymore
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby i’m yours
oh baby i’m yours
oh baby i’m yours
oh baby i’m yours
oh baby i’m yours
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby i’m yours
i’m mad at you
for being so cute
and changing my mood
and altering my rude
what’s wrong with you
you make me sick for being so perfect
what did i do
what can i do , ohh
and i wasn’t trying
to melt this heart of iron
but the way you hold me makes the old me pass away
and i would be lying
if i said i wasn’t scared to fall again
but if you promise me you’ll catch me
then it’s okay
cause i’ve had my heart
broken before
and i promised i would never let me hurt anymore
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby i’m yours
oh baby i’m yours
oh baby i’m yours
oh baby i’m yours
oh baby i’m yours
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby i’m yours
oh i hate that i
spend my days just wasting time day dreaming til i see you again
i’m not used to this
oh i used to be so used to boys just using me
for you to be you to me
feels new to me
cause i usually cheer for the bad side
love under a bad sign
so it makes me mad i’m
falling again
falling again
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby i’m yours
oh baby i’m yours
oh baby i’m yours
oh baby i’m yours
oh baby i’m yours
but i tore down my walls
and opened my doors
and made room for one
so baby i’m yours
oh baby i’m yours
