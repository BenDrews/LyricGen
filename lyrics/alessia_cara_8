trying hard not to fall
on the way home
you were trying to wear me down , down
kissing up on fences
and up on walls
on the way home
i guess it's all working out , now
cause there's still too long to the weekend
too long till i drown in your hands
too long since i've been a fool , oh
leave this blue neighbourhood
never knew loving could hurt this good , oh
and it drives me wild
cause when you look like that
i've never ever wanted to be so bad , oh
it drives me wild
you're driving me wild , wild , wild
you're driving me wild , wild , wild
you're driving me wild
weâ€™re alike you and i
two blue hearts locked in our wrong minds
so can we make the most out of no time ?
can you hold me ?
can you make me leave my demons & my broken pieces behind ?
cause there's still too long to the weekend
too long till i drown in your hands
too long since i've been a fool , oh , yeah , yeah , yeah
leave this blue neighbourhood
never knew loving could hurt this good , oh
and it drives me wild
cause when you look like that
i've never ever wanted to be so bad , oh
it drives me wild
you're driving me wild , wild , wild
you make my heart shake
bend and break
but i can't turn away
and it's driving me wild
you're driving me wild
you make my heart shake
bend and break
but i can't turn away
and it's driving me wild
you're driving me wild
leave this blue neighbourhood
never knew loving could hurt this good , oh
and it drives me wild
cause when you look like that
i've never ever wanted to be so bad , oh
it drives me wild
you're driving me wild , wild , wild
