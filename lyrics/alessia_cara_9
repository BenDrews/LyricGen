still got the flowers that you sent
and the note you wrote that said we're meant to be forever
i keep them all as evidence
in a drawer under the mirror , filled with empty promises
i don't know why
i keep letting you lie to me
hard as i try
it seems i can't break away
i thought that you would be the hero
come and save the day
but you're a villain
your sins unforgiven
i'm going down , and you have watched me drown
in a river of tears , lost beneath the stream
under the waves , i've found the strength to say
the river of tears has washed me clean
go 'head and wish me well
i'll cry a wishing well
i'll fly before i fail
i'll set sail and drift away
so i won't need you here
love sinks and hope floats
in a river of tears
in a river of tears
i catch your scent in every wind
and i recall the love we had , i can't pretend
that i don't miss you every now and then
but the hurt is for the better
moving on , it's now or never
lost in the tide , i can't keep my pillows dry
like there's a sea in my eyes
i realize that sometimes love brings you flowers
then it builds you coffins
and far too often
we end up falling to our demise
i'm going down , and you have watched me drown
in a river of tears , lost beneath the stream
under the waves , i've found the strength to say
the river of tears has washed me clean
go 'head and wish me well
i'll cry a wishing well
i'll fly before i fall
i'll set sail and drift away
so i won't need you here
love sinks and hope floats
in a river of tears
in a river of tears
cry me a river , build myself a bridge
i'm over this , can't let memories become the death of me
i'm glad to see everything that you are
and i believe that you are everything i needed
but i don't need no more
i'm going down , and you have watched me drown
in a river of tears , lost beneath the stream
under the waves , i've found the strength to say
the river of tears has washed me clean
go 'head and wish me well
i'll cry a wishing well
i'll fly before i fall
i'll set sail and drift away
so i won't need you here
love sinks and hope floats
in a river of tears
in a river of tears
