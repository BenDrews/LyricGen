look around never been here before
never had a beer before
hustling like it's thibodeau coaching
i'm rolling up grain 'till the pendulum swings
to the center of frame , hope you get it in focus
i got a little lady lurking , she just be rolling me dope
you never dropped 80 on 'em , never went kobe before
i had to cop from my new nigga today is hopefully smoking
wizzle wiley be the fucking guy how we supposed to be smoking
i been called a lot of things
i done broke a lot of things
i've been known to slaughter things
fuck that bitch like ba - da - bing
don't give fucks , it's not a thing
my new bitch be spazzing out think that's a fucked up father thing
told bitch don't be bothering me i'm singing
i just wanna stay forever
every night i pray for everyone
i just wanna stay forever and ever
man i been tryna keep it potent
uh , the team divided but we forever be riding for the people pay attention to the quotient
uh , it's such a mixture of talent and knowledge and people and purpose and polish all in a potion
uh , my people blind and they thirsty , they hungry , they hurting , they searching for water i brought an ocean
uh , but if you think that it looks hopeless yo shit is out of focus don't ever think it's sweet
because my wrist is not as froze give a fuck about the gold i just do it for the free
been tryna give you all this truth , i don't mean to be so blunt , i can offer you some tree
some ginger ale for your ho's , glass of water for your soul , come and hit this thc
i swear one sip is all you need
