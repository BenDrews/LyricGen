okay , i been , i been high for way too long
i just came to show face , okay ?
ain’t trying to stay too long
i just do my own thing , okay ?
and hope it all work out
trying to set the bullshit a blaze
and hope it all burn down
and niggas ain’t shit if they spitting
they ain’t spit it like i do
nigga why you looking around i’m right by you
act stupid enough they might sign you
i’ve been killing shows from ny to the bayou
and you can keep your fucking take on what i do
i bet it’s super fucking fake when i smile
never thought i’d envy a child
they way they so free , so honest , so wild
but , i just hope that you’re feeling the same
i just hope that you’re feeling the boy
i just know that i spit it insane
i just know that i’m filling the void
weak niggas i’m finna destroy
i be gunning shit up when i came
know we left as the end of the story
when it’s all said and done you seem like a rock
cream always gone rise to the top
lil nigga we killing the noise
now i only put down good vibrations
i don't even see the lows
tunnel vision to the paper
i don't really need you hoes
but if i like her energy
then motherfuck her body count
authenticity i need
so please don't change on my account
i don't think they understand
i'm my own man
i'm a grown man
you are not my homies
v's up nigga ! v's up nigga !
20 years in the wind
been on the line
been on the run
this shit blazing hot
this shit from the sun
so then stop seeing her
try to think of someone else for once
aiyo you would've think i would've made me a big shot by now
in chicago you gone fuck around and get shot right now
phone blowing up all my things like right now
she's trying to come over , bitch not right now
never feel low when i'm filling my tank
and my niggas around me tell me i'm spilling my drink
ok , ok hear that monday , sluts all on me , feel the hate
crabs legs , these lamb chops , this prime rib so viscous
got a set of twins that's gone set the table
and a naked bitch to put the dishes on
life's a game i'll give away between your main thing and your mistress
you keep bringing me on
and then blink and be gone
bask in it don't miss shit bro
