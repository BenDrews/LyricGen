where is she ?
oh my god , claire !
you look so nice today !
no , really !
i push the button , flip the switch
leave the tables flipped and shit
you go 60 plus in practice
when it's clutch you miss the kiss
down by one , give my dick a break
why don't you let a player play ?
ridin' through , you tyronn lue
i'm ai with the fade away
fuck any nigga that throw shade
i was chillin' in a sweater your momma just crocheted
i been feelin' like a bitch with this beard , but i won't shave
but i was sittin' in the middle
hate me in the kennel
throwin' bricks about the homies
they'll break the hunna water , city block , no skittles
so riddle me this
pick a letter that don't rhyme
but when you goin' do this
they bitchin'
miss me ? listen
you gon' end up missing
you know who gon' find you ? some old bitch fishing
no bitch , listen !
i'm done with the game
got the sun through my back
see me off in the distance , damn
never'll be seen again
said she ain't dome the squad
never believe your friends
she told me she on the pill
i don't really give no fucks , imma just leave it in
i can't even stunt
i can't even stunt we three suburbans deep
look like the fuckin' federales when we roll up
i can't even stunt
i can't even stunt if you come through this
session with a swisher nigga
you don't even know us
i can't even stunt
i can't even stunt we three suburbans deep
look like the fuckin' federales when we roll up
i can't even stunt
i can't even stunt if you come through this
session with a swisher nigga
you don't even know us
i got a new corolla
bendin' the corner , doin' yoga
race down all the time
the engine needs water , the seats don't recline
the ac don't work
the carpet got dirt
i guess what i'm tryn'a say is
you mine so i love you regardless
one man's garbage , another man's goddess
we going through the car wash until you spotless
push a button just to see you topless
i know the lambos gossip , and the rovas too
they wanna know why i got a soft spot for you
we'd a been through a lot , had you parked in my spot every night
and we never forgot to turn off the lights
until that one day , i done slipped up
and that tow truck
picked up my bitch
i can't even stunt
i can't even stunt we three suburbans deep
look like the fuckin' federales when we roll up
i can't even stunt
i can't even stunt if you come through this
session with a swisher nigga
you don't even know us
i can't even stunt
i can't even stunt we three suburbans deep
look like the fuckin' federales when we roll up
i can't even stunt
i can't even stunt if you come through this
session with a swisher nigga
you don't even know us
