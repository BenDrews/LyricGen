green are the hills of the land i call home
far across the sea
and green are the eyes of my one true love
who was cruelly torn from me
red is the sand of the land i now roam
in the heat of the day
and red was the blood that was spilled from her wounds
as her spirit slipped away !
pale is the moon in the heavens above
where she waits for me
and pale was her skin as she breathed her last
lying there 'neath the old rowan tree !
black is the night and the hearts of the beasts
who would pose as men
and black is the space she has left in my heart
that will never fill a again !
