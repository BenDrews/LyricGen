doors up
break them boys off with a fresh pair of robins
a fresh pair of robins
break them boys off with a fresh pair of robins
break them boys off with a fresh pair of robins
i keep a fresh pair of robins
break them boys off with a fresh pair of robins
jumped out the derrick rose then i strike a pose
robin wings on me , i'm fresh head to toe
it takes a lot of detail and precision
you wouldn't understand cause you ain't in my division
we don't have the same vision , that's why you ain't my competition
two ears and one mouth , that's why you need to listen
more than you talk , silver surfer j - walk
gas pack global , talking on my t - mobile
thunder storm denim with the robin jean emblem
riff... it's riff
break them boys off with a fresh pair of robins
a fresh pair of robins
break them boys off with a fresh pair of robins
break them boys off with a fresh pair of robins
i keep a fresh pair of robins
break them boys off with a fresh pair of robins
fourteen foreign cars , eenie - minie - moe
i put the pressure on 'em , smoking pressure with my woe
i keep my bitches fly , i bought some robins for my hoes
i'm hopping out the bimmer , i'm rocking handmade features
old school chevelle , same size as lil wayne
zippers on my pockets , i secure the bag
i ate already but i'll still pay the tab
break them boys off with a fresh pair of robins
a fresh pair of robins
break them boys off with a fresh pair of robins
break them boys off with a fresh pair of robins
i keep a fresh pair of robins
break them boys off with a fresh pair of robins
