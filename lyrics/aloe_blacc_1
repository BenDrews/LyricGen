i wrote my way out
when the world turned its back on me
i was up against the wall
i had no foundation
no friends and no family to catch my fall
running on empty , with nothing left in me but doubt
i picked up a pen
and wrote my way out ( i wrote my way out )
i picked up the pen like hamilton
street analyst , now i write words that try to channel 'em
no political power , just lyrical power
sittin' on a crate on a corner , sippin' for hours
schemin' on a come up , from evening'to sun up
my man awaitin' trial , misdemeanors we younger
courtroom prejudice , insufficient evidence
jailhouse lawyers , these images still relevant
flickerin' lights inside my project hall
sickenin' , the mice crawl all night long
and '87 reaganism , many pages i've written on
writin' songs about rights and wrongs and bails bonds
master bedroom , bigger than the crib that i was raised at
i'm the architect like i wrote the code to waze app
i'm driven , black elohim from the streets of queens
the definition of what it was written means
know what i mean ?
i wrote my way out
when the world turned its back on me
i was up against the wall
i had no foundation
no friends and no family to catch my fall
running on empty , there was nothing left in me but doubt
i picked up a pen
and i wrote my way out ( i wrote my way out )
i really wrote my way up out of 6e
develop relationships with fiends , i know they miss me
before the metrocards , it was tokens , i did the ten speed
never had wrote a rhyme in my life , what was a sixteen ?
at sixteen , arrested in housin' , trips to the mountains
came right back , trappin' off couches , watchin' for mouses
only tools we was posed with , had a spot , smoke lit
the hate is just confusion , pay attention how them jokes switch
diadora was my favorite , the mark buchanans
mama couldn't afford them , i learned everythin' on the border
that's a big 8 , clicquot parties with private dancers with no mixtape
bumble bee tuna , now we could get steak
i persevered , composition , i kept it close
competition near , i'm a spartan without the spear
three hundred rhymes , it was written before i wrote it
opportunity knockin' , might miss it , that window closin'
this poetry in motion , i'm a poet
i wrote my way out
when the world turned its back on me
i was up against the wall
i had no foundation
no friends and no family to catch my fall
running on empty , there was nothing left in me but doubt
i picked up a pen
and wrote my way out ( i wrote my way out )
high speed , dubbin' these rhymes in my dual cassette deck
runnin' out of time like i'm jonathan larson's rent check
my mind is where the wild things are , maurice sendak
in withdrawal , i want it all , please give me that pen back
y'all , i caught my first beatin' from the other kids when i was caught readin'
" oh , you think you smart ? blah ! start bleedin' "
my pops tried in vain to get me to fight back
sister tapped my brains , said , pssh , you'll get 'em right back
oversensitive , defenseless , i made sense of it , i pencil in
the lengths to which i'd go to learn my strengths and knock 'em senseless
these sentences are endless , so what if they leave me friendless ?
damn , you got no chill , fuckin' right i'm relentless
i know abuela's never really gonna win the lottery
so it's up to me to draw blood with this pen , hit an artery
this puerto rican's brains are leakin' through the speakers
and if he can be the shinin' beacon this side of the g.w.b and
shine a light when it's gray out
i wrote my way out
oh , i was born in the eye of a storm
no lovin' arms to keep me warm
this hurricane in my brain is the burden i bear
i can do without , i'm here ( i'm here )
cause i wrote my way out
i picked up the pen like hamilton
i wrote my way out of the projects
wrote - wrote my way out of the projects
picked up the pen like hamilton
i wrote my way out of the
wrote - wrote my way out of the projects
i wrote my way out
picked up the pen like hamilton
i wrote my way out of the
( i wrote my way out )
really , i saw like a hole in the rap game , so if i wanted to put my little two cents in the game , then it would be from a different perspective
( i wrote my way out )
i thought that i would represent for my neighborhood and tell their story , be their voice , in a way that nobody has done it
tell the real story
