who can help me take away my sorrow
maybe its inside the bottle
maybe its inside the bottle
i had some good old buddy his names is whiskey and wine
and for my good old buddy i spent my last dime
my wine is good to me it helps me pass the time
and my good old buddy whiskey keeps me warmer than sunshine
your mama may have , bless the child that's got his own
if god has plans for me i hope it ain't written in stone
because i've been working working myself down to the bone
and i swear on grandpa's grave i'll be paid when i come home
