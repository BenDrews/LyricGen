something special happened today
i got green lights all the way
with no big red sign to stop me
no traffic jam delay
see i was driving over the moon
in my big hot air balloon
floating high into the darkness
i hope i get there soon
it's so many things to do
so many people i need to talk to
and they've all been waiting for me
well i gotta make it through
thank my stars for every green
you have no idea what it means
to a man who's always traveling
who's seen the things that i've seen
i don't know what's yet to come
not sure if anything that i've done
really makes that much a difference
well i hope it has for some
well i was driving over the moon
in my big hot air balloon
floating high up into the darkness
i promise that i'll make it to you very soon
