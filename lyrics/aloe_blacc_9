the whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
the whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
so keep your calm and carry on
the whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
the sun may never rise again
the question ain’t if but when
the sea will boil and the sky will fall
the sun may never rise again
the silent war has begun
we’re staring down a loaded gun
no refuge found on solid ground
this human race can’t be won
and it’s about to explode
they’re reaching in my pockets again
the ice we’re standing on is thin
making plans with greedy hands
they’re reaching in my pockets again
the future is a dying art
laying in a ditch in the dark
i need you here but all i hear ( is )
the beating of a broken heart
don’t wait to say goodbye
you’re running out of time
whatever you believe
it’s easy to see
( the whole world )
the whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
and it don’t care what side you’re on
the whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
so keep your calm and carry on
the whole world’s sitting on a ticking bomb
