the king may rule o’er land and sea ,
the lord may live right royally ,
the soldier ride in pomp and pride ,
the sailor roam o’er ocean wide ;
but this or that , whate’er befall ,
the farmer he must feed them all.
the writer thinks , the poet sings ,
the craftsmen fashion wondrous things ,
the doctor heals , the lawyer pleads ,
the miner follows the precious leads ;
but this or that , whate’er befall ,
the farmer he must feed them all.
the merchant he may buy and sell ,
the teacher do his duty well ;
but men may toil through busy days ,
or men may stroll through pleasant ways ;
from king to beggar , whate’er befall ,
the farmer he must feed them all.
the farmer’s trade is one of worth ;
he’s partner with the sky and earth ,
he’s partner with the sun and rain ,
and no man loses for his gain ;
and men may rise , or men may fall ,
but the farmer he must feed them all.
god bless the man who sows the wheat ,
who finds us milk and fruit and meat ;
may his purse be heavy , his heart be light ,
his cattle and corn and all go right ;
god bless the seeds his hands let fall ,
for the farmer he must feed us all.
