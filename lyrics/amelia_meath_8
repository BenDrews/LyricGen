the yellow cab drivers
the trams on their wires
the heels on the pavement
collecting outside
the all seeing window
it’s clairvoyant glow
where each new indulgence
is born and on show
and it all starts to seem
like love's possible now
a fairy god mother
at every checkout
sometimes
you won’t believe it’s true
sometimes
but then others
you just need a new you
you could be coco , amelia
gertrude bell or britney
you’d have the eyes of a gorgon
skin like anne frank's
they’ll ask you your secret
but don’t kiss and tell
just say thanks
you won’t recognise me
won’t know who i am
like i’m on the witness
protection programme
keeping all my receipts
and my enemies close
sometimes they flee from you
sometimes they don’t
sometimes
they put the fear in you
sometimes
but it’s always done for your own good
see you could be
pan frying low flying human meat
all willingly
esprit is just nonsense
but nonsense feels free
a freehold on your soul’s
worth its weight in gold
take it from me
