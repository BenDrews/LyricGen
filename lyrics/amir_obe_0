questions like , " can you get drake's number ? " nope , no way , jose
rolling out , every time the hummer pull out , remember slowly in the slow lane
police still watchin' the boy now cause i ain't no boy now , i'm the man
tings i gotta understand , my girl wanna see a plan
house , and a porsche to drive in
we just need some keys just to put them inside it
the crib look like a temple , man we livin' in silence
we juugin' so silently , the money is silent
true , say the girls do adore us
who do we all do it for ?
hey , sorry for the wait , amen
all i need's a little more room for me
and it'll be straight
i'm at petro gassin' up , tell that boy his pass is up
cut the cheque , quit checkin' up , i'm okay
i'm good , i'm good , i'm good , i'll always be good
i'm good , i'm good , i'm good , i'll always be good
i'm good , i'm good , i'll always be good
i'm good , i'm good , i'm good , i'm good
don't say you've been hittin' me up
don't say you've been callin' , brand new foreign , it just picked me up
all that talkin' , you say i ain't down for you
a nigga like me ain't got no time for girl like you
no apologies , i hold a grudge
dealin' with the comma , broken hearted women try fix me up
i ain't with the swindle , smokin' out the window
i don't pass the blunt , no no
taro's in the cup , girl i used to fuck with you 'til i realized who i was
no way , 45 nights on the low
45 nights in a row , true say
you adjusted to the road
you get the packet , you live through pics and the captions
you talk a lot just to say that you have it
back now , we fuck with no passion
and if they keep askin' , i say i'm good
i'm good , i'm good , i'm good , i'll always be good
i'm good , i'm good , i'm good , i'll always be good
i'm good , i'm good , i'll always be good
i'm good , i'm good , i'm good , i'm good
