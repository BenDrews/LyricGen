i can't trust a girl that's heard it all before
all them rapping niggas that you vouching for
lost a good girl for a bad one
and then she claiming , yeah , i'll be the last one
tell me all your flaws , bet you i'll relate
tell me all your wrongs , bae , i'll take the blame
smoking on the ganja , got me so cloudy
kill my energy , they still got doubts about me
text me when i'm lit , just before the vomit
chase me when i'm coming down , and solve my problems
think it when i'm sober , say it when i'm drunk
don't need no closure , i'm still thinking that it's love
i can't trust a girl that's heard it all before
all them rapping niggas that you vouching for
lost a good girl for a bad one
and then she claiming , yeah , i'll be the last one
she don't love me , she just love potential , i know
searching for yourself , you need direction , i know
you too fine to blend in with the rest of these hoes
i'm just another guy that tried impressing you though
bite my tongue until it bleeds
tryna figure you out , but you hard to read bae
i'm just honest , them promises hard to keep bae
see you run through my nightmares , it's hard to sleep bae
yeah , yeah
tell me all your flaws , bet you i'll relate
tell me all your wrongs , babe , i'll take the blame
smoking on the ganja , got me so cloudy
kill my energy , they still got doubts about me
hit me when i'm lit , just before the vomit
chase me when i'm coming down , and solve my problems
think it when i'm sober , say it when i'm drunk
don't need no closure , i'm still thinking that it's love
yeah , yeah
