where your love now ?
pour my heart out to the floors now
treatin' love like a drug , i been drugged out
treat your feelings like a target , bring them guns out
kept on shooting just to prove that you ain't numb now
put a ring on a middle finger , fuck you
hope it stings just a little when it cuts through
kept it distant from them women that be tellin' now
all them stories you ain't told , you can tell 'em now
i don't get enough credit
'less we scamming understand we get enough credit
i make it work either way 'till the peace stop
i'm seeing all my enemies throw the peace sign , no peace
let them bodies hit the floor now
let them bodies hit the floor now , now , now , now , now
let them bodies hit the floor now
