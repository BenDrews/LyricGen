throwing up the west , smoking on the best
headed to the east , let you know we eating'
i be in the street , i be in the streak
you be in the birds throwing up the bees
sittin' pretty in the drought
broke niggas love to say " meet me at the top "
rollin' up the loud , i got the whole city proud
couple niggas made it , i'm like " where they at now ? "
