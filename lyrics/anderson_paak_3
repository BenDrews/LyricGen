yeah , all of that ass you carrying
you gotta be shitting me
all that body that you came with
but where are you mentally ?
i know ya hear it all the time
but you ain't gonna hear from me
i just wanna focus on them lovelies
what's behind them tig - ol - bitties ?
they say the heart is underneath
underneath the guarded insecurities
i finally found the key
underneath the garments that's the double d's
open your heart , x spots the mark , baby
don't turn around , make an ass out yourself , baby
open your heart
what's behind them tig - ol - bitties ?
i don't mind them little bitty berries
you my ju - ju - be
i don't need nothing to distract me
from this connectivity
you know i see it all the time
the same old shit to me
i just wanna know what's under
that tender titty meat
they say the heart is underneath
underneath the guarded insecurities
i finally found the key
underneath the garments that's the double d's
open your heart , x spots the mark , baby
don't turn around , make an ass out yourself , baby
open your heart
what's behind them tig - ol - bitties ?
before you go and pop that bottom baby
before you go and get butt naked baby
i know you gotta little bit of baggage baby
never mind i'mma look past it
big cans in the cooler , let me handle it baby
two jugs i'm gonna start grasping you baby
separation between truth and the fake
you can get a new rack for five k
you can get a rapper by friday
you gon' have to replace being cheapskate , just save it
can a nigga squeeze or should i just be safe ?
( yeah for - sure ) tell me what it reads on the expiration date
( well i just got them , should be good for about ten years or so )
i know you feel the d when a nigga deep in the hole
but do you feel the peace when i'm sucking them , baby doll ?
( can you fuck me already ? )
open your heart , baby , x spots the mark , baby
don't turn around , make an ass out yourself , baby
open your heart
what's behind them tig - ol - bitties ?
open your heart , baby , x spots the mark , baby
what's behind them tig - ol - bitties ?
for me i can't live in the northern hemisphere
i must live , back , back in the time
where all these animals , all this sea life , all the oysters , shellfish , crustaceans , everything is part of the smell
everything has come into the focus of the whole experience
