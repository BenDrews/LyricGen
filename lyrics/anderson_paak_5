ooh , champagne pourin' down
arms , legs wrapped around you
ooh , champagne , let it fall down
arms , legs keep grabbing
see , i be catchin' you starin' , be careful
the idle mind is a dangerous place to be left in
but keep your eyes on me
yeah , your heart don't stand a chance
it feels like it's been far too long
your knees can't hold your legs
your feet just want to pace
the eyes keep me all in a trance
let me ask you
would you leave it all in the back of your head
or all in the palm of my hand ?
ain't nobody holding you back
don't it feel like it's been far too long , girl ?
your heart don't stand a chance
your knees just want to break
your eyes keep me all in a trance
and let me ask you
i know the approach is so far from what you're used to
but you know it
and do i hold a candle to the last one over your moon ?
baby , of course i do
and i'm not closing my tab
don't it feel like it's been far too long , girl ?
your heart don't stand a chance
ooh , champagne pourin' down
arms , legs wrapped around you
ooh , champagne , let it fall down
arms , legs keep grabbing
two - step in the corridor
spinning the greatest hits of hall & oates
open of chronic smoke
i know my time will flee
but your heart don't stand a chance
it feels like it's been far too long
the moment is all that we have
my meter should be up by the half
a ticket is the least of my cares
so let me ask you
am i dreaming ?
mind on a tip of a cloud
or is it real as the stone in your crown ?
say , ain't nobody towing my jag
don't it feel like it's been far too long , girl ?
your heart don't stand a chance
i'm waiting for the white flag
you're talking with the blunt in your hand
and won't you pass that ?
i know , in the morning
the sunlight cover your wounds
but i'm hoping that i look the same as the way you always knew
baby , your course , i flew
but i'm not over what we had
don't it feel like it's been far too long , girl ?
your heart don't stand a chance
ooh , champagne pourin' down
arms , legs wrapped around you
ooh , champagne , let it fall down
arms , legs keep grabbing
i remember being tumbled around and not being able to get to the surface where the air was
and looking down and seeing my body spinning around in the white water
