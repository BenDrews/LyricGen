besides surfing , what do you think about ? love , for instance ?
i don't think about it , i make it
baby there's room in here
just enough for two in here
ain't nobody but you and me in here
yeah , what can we do in here ?
what can we do ? what can we do ?
i want you by my lonesome , above this crowded space
it's easier to hold some , when no one's in the way
well if no one's in the running for the part
i'd love to pick a day
to show you the main room ( whenever's a good time )
i don't need a bouquet , i just need proper space
homie three blocks away , i got bottles for days
i got tropical haze , go ahead and wave bye
let me help with your coat , grab a hold of my arm
tell them niggas to move , tell your sister you fine
cause baby there's room in here
just enough for two in here
ain't nobody but you and me in here
yeah , what can we do in here ?
what can we do ? what can we do ?
as crazy as it may seem , it's not too hard to read
it's too many ifs and maybes , and not enough certainty
well if no one's putting numbers on the board
i'd love to take a swing , might even graze you
but i don't mean any harm , i'm just speaking my mind
take a look at that moon , 'bout as bright as your eyes
we got plenty of space , go ahead and recline
take a puff of that , get a sip of this wine
yeah , feelin' good ?
cause baby there's room in here
just enough for two in here
ain't nobody but you and me in here
yeah , what can we do in here ?
what can we do ? what can we do ?
she had a bright smile , big white teeth , i mean
whiter than her white t , remind me of wifey
met her at the studio , sort of like a high buyer
she told me she had game so we connected like the wifi
she had this asian swagger â€˜bout her , so i call her mai tai
started followin' her , she was the only thing on my timeline
and there was this one picture , her in the swimsuit
that made a nigga want to beat it up , and i intend to
but i'mma have to put in work , baby girl then drink it all
face like mona lisa , i'm just tryna be the wall to hang on
i ain't got no patience , i can't wait long
she come and see me , but she don't stay long
and that's the problem , she a good girl
maybe it's too much smoke in the room
and she don't want that mary jane in her vidal sassoon
so i'mma take a minute , and walk her to her uber
got a bullet in my heart , and she the shooter
ay , .paak
baby there's room in here
just enough for two in here
ain't nobody but you and me in here
yeah , what can we do in here ?
what can we do ? what can we do ?
