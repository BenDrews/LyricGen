now evolution : where it all going ? is it coming to an end or it it just beginning
there was one fellow who know'd malibu quite well at a certain time in history
and i doubt if very few people are able to find these types of conditions again
due to crowds and controls and much bureaucracy
but there are other areas which are magnificent , treasures of this world
and for somebody with adventure and excitement in their lives , and they have a lot of excitement and adventure
they can find this way of living
