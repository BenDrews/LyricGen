you’re broken down and tired
of living life on a merry - go - round
and you can’t find the fighter
but i see it in you so we gonna walk it out
and move mountains
we gonna walk it out
and move mountains
and i’ll rise up
i'll rise like the day
i’ll rise up
i'll rise unafraid
i'll rise up
and i’ll do it a thousand times again
and i’ll rise up
high like the waves
i’ll rise up
in spite of the ache
i'll rise up
and i’ll do it a thousand times again
for you
for you
for you
for you
when the silence isn’t quiet
and it feels like it’s getting hard to breathe
and i know you feel like dying
but i promise we’ll take the world to its feet
and move mountains
we gonna walk it out
and move mountains
and i’ll rise up
i'll rise like the day
i’ll rise up
i'll rise unafraid
i'll rise up
and i’ll do it a thousand times again
for you
for you
for you
for you
all we need , all we need is hope
and for that we have each other
and for that we have each other
we will rise
we will rise
we’ll rise , ohh ohhh
we’ll rise
i’ll rise up
rise like the day
i’ll rise up
in spite of the ache
i will rise a thousands times again
and we’ll rise up
rise like the waves
we’ll rise up
in spite of the ache
we’ll rise up
and we'll do it a thousands times again
for you ohhhh ohhh ohh ohhh ohh
for you ohhhh ohhh ohh ohhh ohh
for you ohhhh ohhh ohh ohhh ohh
