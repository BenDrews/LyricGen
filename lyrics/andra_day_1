if you could look inside my life
and use my eyes , would you pity me ?
would you see the desperate nights
and all the lies that brought me to my knees
i keep thinking that i have to make you fall
the way i fell from your betrayal to bring me peace of mind
i will let you move along , just walk away
and wear a cape like you're some hero
i can't hear love cause we're at war
and revenge is so loud and the drums are so proud
but oh , i'm in a cage and i hear mercy say " i'm here now "
and it's the only way out
i can't hear love cause we're at war
but revenge is so loud and the drums are so proud
but i'm still in a cage and i hear mercy say now
it's the only way out
i used to hear my father say , " counterplay ends in defeat "
and i said i'd never be that way
tried to make you pay cause it would cost me
but you owe me so much more than what you gave to this
i guess every story twists
people tell me let it go , oh , and forget
i can't hear love cause we're at war
and revenge is so loud and the drums are so proud
but oh , i'm in a cage and i hear mercy say " i'm here now "
and it's the only way out
i can't hear love cause we're at war
but revenge is so loud and the drums are so proud
but i'm still in a cage and i hear mercy say now
it's the only way
mercy's the only way out
mercy gave me my way out
