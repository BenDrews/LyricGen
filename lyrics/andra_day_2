my heart has been a chessboard
making moves and losing out
played so many times before
and there ain't nothing to brag about
but this must be a new brew
when you're gone i'm singing blue moon
you turn me all the way around
and i'm tired of the fine line
i just want you to be forever mine
be forever mine
oh and there's nothing i can sing now
that ain't been sung before
oh but your love is a standout
so go on ahead and take the floor
you had to jimi my heart loose
now i'm stuck in your voodoo
pick me up , don't ever put me down
look i'm tired of the fine line
i just want you to be forever mine
i want you to be forever mine
the way that you move , never seen it before
looking for my head , canâ€™t find it no more
you ransom my heart and i get the reward
winning the crown like a trojan horse
i come back , back , back every time
you got me shook like the mobb when they rhyme
come out of nowhere come blessing my life
i just want you to be forever mine , oh oh
be forever mine
be forever mine
oh but you was cookin' up a new stew
must have put something in my food
cause now i'm lost up in the clouds
oh and i'm tired of the fine line
i just want you to be forever mine
oh you gotta be , be forever mine
