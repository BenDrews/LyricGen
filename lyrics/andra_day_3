( verse one )
when the cold bites your bones
and gets in your heart
it can make you feel hopeless
and fear will come to steal your sun
and make it dark
but don’t believe you’re lonely
( pre - chorus )
we've all had that moment
when our shoulder sink
and we sit back and think
we could just run , but
( chorus )
we're not born
to chase the faded light
we're not born
to fall and lose the fight
never letting go. oh no !
am asking you to
lift me , lift me higher than i ever been
hold your breath and say
you're gonna come with me
we were born to follow
the light that never fails
( ough ough ough ough )
( verse two )
we're scared to fight
we're scared to climb
afraid to die
but i can be your courage
and help you see that you've already won this
( pre - chorus )
we all have that moment
when our head hands low
we question if we should go
or turn back and run , but
( repeat chorus )
( refrain )
( ough ough 6 times )
come along we'll certainly stay
( ough ough 6 times )
never looking back again
( repeat chorus )
we're not born
to chase the faded light
we're not born
to fall and lose the fight
never letting go. oh no , oh
am asking you to
lift me , lift me higher than i ever been
( backup singers : lift me higher )
hold your breath and say
you're gonna come with me
( backup singers : come with me )
we were born to follow
( backup singers : born to follow )
the light that never fails
( backup singers : oughh oughh )
the light that never fails
( backup singers : that never fails ough oughhh )
we were born to follow
the light that never oughhh ough oughhh oughhh
light that never oughhh ough oughhh oughhh
the light that never fails
