sometimes i go right
when the right way was left
don't draw inside the lines
because the scribbles look so sick
and who says you can't win them all
if you try
they say the higher that you climb
the further when you take the dive
but it's comatose
and i can't live that closed
they say the higher that you climb
then when you fall you won’t survive
but it's comatose
and i can't live that closed
’cause i don't know how to never try at all
so cheers to the fall
i can pretend to be perfect
or fit into some made up roll
but i can make the hand i'm dealt work if
i decide to never fold
and who says you can't win them all
if you try
they say the higher that you climb
the further when you take the dive
but it's comatose
and i can't live that closed
they say the higher that you climb
then when you fall you won’t survive
but it's comatose
and i can't live that closed
’cause i don't know how to never try at all
so cheers to the fall
thanks for all your sound advice
that i didn't ask for
i'll take all of it in stride
and now i know
they say the higher that you climb
the further when you take the dive
but it's comatose
and i can't live that closed
they say the further that you climb
then when you fall you won't survive
but it's comatose
and i can't live that closed
’cause i don't know how to never try at all
so cheers to the fall
i'll learn my lesson but i'll try
i'll take the climb
cheers to the fall
cheers to the fall
