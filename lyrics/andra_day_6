the scent of momentum fills the city air
hear the heart beat , it's alive and draws you in
things will never be the same
thought i'd been here , but never here , times before
then the roller coaster dipped and sped along no more
but i'm not in the same space ’
cause i'm hardly the woman that i once was
now i search for the ground underneath my feet
as the city burns , as the city burns
ooh
as the city burns
as the city burns
as the city burns
burns away
burns away
now it's fancy ladies , pricey wiles , and argyle
from homemade beats , selling tee's , and running wild
just hope i don't lose my head
and now i'm thinking on a dream that my sister had
back then i was too young to see it wasn't bad
so thanks chick , by the way ’
cause i'm hardly the woman that i once was
now i search for the ground underneath my feet
as the city burns , as the city burns
ooh
as the city burns
as the city burns
as the city burns
burns away
burns away
we're at a run right now
before we were at a steady jog
and i'm trying to hang on to whatever i can find
because what do you do when it's spinning so fast
how do you stand with the world on your back
i'm hardly the woman i once was
search for the ground underneath my feet
as the city burns , as the city burns
ooh
as the city burns
as the city burns
ooh
burns away
burns away
