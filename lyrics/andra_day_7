he don't know i call him the teacher
he had a hard lesson for the kid
i get i put you through hell
he put me under the same spell
he lied man , he stressed me out
you loved me like a precious gift
and he loved me like a sloppy kiss
you would tell me your heartaches
now i understand the pain
oh why did i let you drown
baby would you believe
that i've been broken
you say memories
play again and again
i see the reel now it's real to me
i gave up gold
for grains of sand
slipping through my hand ( 2x )
you had no problems with commitment
like a king is loyal to what’s his
you looked for a ring to fit
while i played wifey with a kid
oh the irony makes me sick
he tried to make me look crazy
nothing new about his kind of scheme
i laugh when i think about
his face when truth nearly spilled out
he looked like me i get that now
baby would you believe
that i've been broken
you say memories
play again and again
i see the reel , now it's real to me
i gave up gold
for grains of sand
slipping through my hand ( 4x )
baby would you believe
that i've been broken
you say memories
play again and again
i see the reel , now it's real to me
i gave up gold
for grains of sand
slipping through my hand ( 4x )
