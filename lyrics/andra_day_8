rise to her knees in the morning again
giving herself to the sky
searching for answers to all her regrets
wondering , should she even try
but the hope it shines like pearls in her eyes
she asks are you giving up on me
not today , not today ’
cause love isn’t through with what it started here yet
not today , not today
if love isn’t done , then why should we give up on it
so ask me tomorrow , i’ll tell you the same
tomorrow is not today
his tired eyes watching all that he’s built
crumbling down to the ground
perfection is cracked and the dream starts to wilt
sure that he’s failed her now
but the hope shines like pearls in his eyes
when he asks her are you giving in
not today , not today
cause love isn’t through with what it started here yet
not today , no not today
if love isn’t done , then why should we give up on it
so ask me tomorrow , i’ll tell you the same
tomorrow is not today
not today
not today
not today
