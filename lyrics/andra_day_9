i stood outside for hours thinking why
but you meant no harm you say
salty tears burned my face last night
but you meant no harm you say
it was always me waiting on you what a cruel guessing game
you meant no harm you say
now my soul drags behind my feet but i'll be fine i guess
cause you meant no harm you say
still running it back in my mind
trying to see why i was so bloody blind
so blind
i should've known that i'd lose everything
i should have known red flags were warning me
i couldn't see all that because the room was pitch black
til you'd come and gone
you'd come and gone
i spend my time with photos from back when
but you meant no harm you say
i give your lies five stars what a display
cause you meant no harm you say
the truth was never a good friend of yours or mine i guess
and still no harm you say
a pastoral scene shattered to oblivion
you meant no harm you say
still running it back in my mind
trying to see why i was so bloody blind
so blind
i should've known that i'd lose everything
i should have known red flags were warning me
i couldn't see all that because the room was pitch black
til you'd come and gone
you'd come and gone
are good intentions all you really have left for me
can they cover the hole you left here in my heart
oh oh well what more can i say
i should've known that i'd lose everything
i should have known red flags were warning me
i couldn't see all that because the room was pitch black
you'd come and gone
you'd come and gone
i should've known that you'd take everything
i should've known to kiss my heart away
you'd come and gone
