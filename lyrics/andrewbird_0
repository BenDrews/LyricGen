i don't believe everything happens for a reason
to us romantics out here , that amounts to high treason
i don't go in for your star - crossed lovers
in the heart of a skeptic
there's a question that still hovers near
for it begs the question
how did i ever find you ?
now you got me writing love songs
with a common refrain like this one here , baby
and all your left handed kisses
were just prelude to another
prelude to your backhanded love song , baby
but it begs a question
how did i ever find you
drifting gently through the gyre
of the great sargasso sea , atlantic ocean
got me writing love songs
with a common refrain like this one here
the point your song here misses
is that if you really loved me
you'd risk more than a few 50 cent
words in your backhanded love song
for it begs the question
how did i ever find you
drifting gently through the gyre
of the great sargasso sea , atlantic ocean
the point your song here misses
you got me writing love songs
is that you really love me
with a common refrain like this one here , baby
is prelude to another of your backhanded love songs
now it's time for a handsome little bookend
now it's time to tie up all the loose ends
am i still a skeptic or did you make me a believer ?
if you hesitate , you'll hear the click of the receiver
