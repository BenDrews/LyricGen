now when you wake up
night's falling someone is by your side
pull it together , darling you're not alone
but when you break up
sky's falling , no one is on your side
spoon dirty laundry , darling you're all alone
and when you wake up , another sunrise
another break up , this ship is capsized
and when you wake up , another sunrise
another break up , this ship is capsized
just keep your lamp on
now he's a dyin' bed maker
he's a dyin' bed maker jesus gonna make my...
it's a holy ghost , holy ghost religion
it's a holy ghost religion jesus gonna make my...
and when you wake up , another sunrise
another break up , this ship is capsized
and when you wake up , another sunrise
another break up , this ship is capsized
and when you wake up
night's falling , someone is by your side
pull it together , darling you're not alone
but when you break up
sky's falling , no one is on your side
spoon dirty laundry , darling you're all alone
spoon dirty laundry , darling you're all alone
spoon dirty laundry , darling you're all alone
and when you wake up , another sunrise
another break up , this ship is capsized
