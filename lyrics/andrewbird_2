half empty , half full
cup runneth over
horns of plenty , coffers full
we're starting over
half empty , half full
cup runneth over
horns of plenty , coffers full
we're starting over
i write you a story
but it loses its thread
and all of my witnesses
keep turning up , keep turning up dead
i paint you a picture
of pulaski at night
come back to chicago
city of , city of light
come back to chicago
i paint you a picture
but it never looks right
cause i fill in the shadows
and block out the , i block out the light
i send you a postcard
it says , " pulaski at night "
greetings from chicago
city of , city of light
come back to chicago
city of , city of light
come back to chicago
started over....
