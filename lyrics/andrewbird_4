come on , all you stand - up men
you self - empowered go - getters
and all your lucky ladies
to whom you write your letters
i keep moving through my days
as if i'd never met her
but ever since i , i gave up hope
i've been feeling so much better
yeah i'm feelin' so much better
but ever since i gave up hope
i've been feelin' so much better
so here's a mighty revelation
that's sure to cure what ails ya
that everyone's just a disappointment
and everyone's a failure
and this we shall celebrate
in our finest regalia
like a choir of shining angels
a congregation of mahalias
i'm feelin' so much better
ever since i thought i gave up hope
i've been feeling so much better
you hear that bell now
you hear it ringing
you hear it ringing
the bells of st. jude
so fill your lungs now
cause we'll be singin'
we'll be singin'
we love you , st. jude
we'll be singin'
we love you , st. jude
feelin' so much better
feelin' so much better
feelin' so much better
feelin' so much better
