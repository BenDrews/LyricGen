there'll be three white horses
all in a line
there'll be three white horses
in a line
three white horses when you go that way
you'll need somebody when you come to die
don't dismiss it like it's easy
tell me what's so easy
about coming to say goodbye ?
you're gonna miss her in the evening
you know all you need is
somebody when you come to die
there'll be three white horses
all in a line
there'll be three white horses
in a line
three white horses when you go that way
you'll need somebody when you come to die
it's not desperation we're breeding
it's just a need we're feeding
before we say goodbye
you're gonna miss me in the evening
you know all you need is
somebody when you come to die
you know all you need is
somebody when you come to die
