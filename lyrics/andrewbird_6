here's a little game
you can play alone
oh you do the walk of shame
from the comfort of your home
so here's another game
you can play along
where you empty all your blame
from your guilty bones
oh the eyes , the eyes , the eyes , they know
( the eyes , they know )
like a thousand tiny suns that glow
( and they burn and they glow )
oh the eyes , the eyes , the eyes , they know
while truth lies low
while truth lies low
so here's another game...
fools are taking aim
they got pistols in their phones
holocene is on the wane
we got plastic in our stones
oh the lies , the lies , the lies , they grow
( the lies , they grow )
like a thousand tributaries flow
( the eyes , they know )
oh the eyes , the eyes , the eyes , they know
while truth lies low
while truth lies low
vitriol from their pens flows
anonymously their hate crows
but at least they care enough
at least they care enough
at least they care enough
to let you know
