used to have just one foot out the door
yeah , i always wanted more
i always was the one
you thought would never marry
used to be so wilfully obtuse , or is the word abstruse ?
semantics like a noose , get out your dictionaries
i'm gonna cut to the quick
this is all non - fiction
words you beat with a stick
these are my true convictions
so tell me , are you serious ?
are you serious ?
cause every night of your life
you'll fight for it
so mysterious
how imperious !
but are you serious
when it really comes down to it ?
i see that you're down there and i'm up here
your boyfriend's gone to get a beer
leaving us crystal clear lines of communications
promise me you won't avert your eyes
i'll drop my third - person disguise
you know it's time to do or die
no useless explanations
i'm gonna cut to the quick
this is all non - fiction
words you beat with a stick
these are my true convictions
tell me , are you serious ?
are you serious ?
every night of your life
you'll fight for it
so mysterious
how imperious !
but are you serious
when it really comes down to it ?
