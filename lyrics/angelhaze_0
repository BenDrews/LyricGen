round of applause bitches slap me with some clappin
show my whole fucking ass like a fat bitch in chaps
but i’ll be running that shit like a motherfuckin' tracker
like a run - on sense like a motherfuckin' chopper
like a cheetah in the jungle but i’m motherfucking faster
like a pre - teen boy in the church with a pastor
hold up i’m not serious i’m just playin — psych !
fuck your opinion bitch i mean it when i’m sayin that
money and more money is the only shit i’m after
you can cut the fake shit

i’m an undefeated bastard
my tongue is the fucking rapture , bitch
i be at my peak , i am not the one to be mastered
i’m the one to be after , i’m sweeping you while i’m dusting
i just popped up out the blue , i’m spontaneously combusting
spit a little different , give me just a minute
beat the beat down bitch , fresh it then i kill it
we are not the same but they don’t really get it
tell ‘em do the math , hoe—fraction , division
sick flow sick ho , drop me in the clinic
eat 'em 'til the end 'til they back at the beginning
cause i ki - ki - ki - kill it ‘til it’s flat dead
and never pass a rock like a motherfucking crackhead
