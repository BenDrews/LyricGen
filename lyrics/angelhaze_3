uh
i’m running , running through the jungle
running like a slave through the underground tunnel
told y'all niggas better get these bitches
cause i spit till my lips need 16 stitches
i am lyrical intrusion
you bitches can’t see me like i’m really an illusion
i hop up on your face and do my motherfucking two - step
till i knock the meat out like a motherfucking toothpick
uh , i’m nasty nigga , like nas , like kim , like cassie pictures
like i’m fucking chris stokes or that raz - b nigga
or the skin on the feet of a ashy nigga
i am whatever they say i am
bumping like the asses on them thick bitches at stadium
fuck them other bitches i sound better in the place of them
i killed this shit , this the motherfucking requiem
sick bitch , chicken noodle soup face
calls from overseas like a motherfucking crusade
crack rock and you can hit it till your nose hurt
rooftop brooklyn , made this shit in covert
i run new york , i run new york
i am zero past a hundred , spitting like a dragon
that went missing from a dungeon
y’all a bunch of niggas getting trippy off of nothing
tie a rope around your neck and let me kick you off a bungee
i’m satan , and i’ma take your ass to church now
running my fields and you midgets on your first down
i love it when these bitches know i’m better than them
cause i don’t hear , not a word or a letter from them
i’m a fire in the midst of a forest ‘round bitches
and i rap elliptical orbits round bitches
anaconda , i sit with an open mouth , bitches
and you bitches are lyrically
like some fucking down syndrome , no offense
no shade 'n all , but y’all bitches on knees like babies crawl
you can catch me out in covert , chilling like a stoop kid
yeah i hear you , don’t talk bitch , do
i'm a lyrical criminal general
take shots , but never subliminal
don’t stop , ever continual
running and running but never in intervals
can’t even stomach the shit that i’m finna do
y'all niggas want the shit that i’m giving you
if you front , i’m gon' put and end to you
i’m like scorpion , bitch i will finish you
'make it nasty' , real real nasty
why you bitches running like you will get past me ?
won’t happen , you bitches could get on , when i’m off it
try to cross me now , you be gone in a coffin
it’s just me , myself and i
talk tough shit and i’ma beat you till you die
ask why ? because i’m better than you’ll ever be
that’s why my shit make your shit seem lighter than heavy d
