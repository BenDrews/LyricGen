where the light shivers offshore
through the tides of oceans
we are shining in the rising sun
as we are floating in the blue
i am softly watching you
oh boy , your eyes betray what burns inside you
you were a maze to never be completed
and i fell through cracks in all your little secrets
but your grip won’t let me free and closed eyes won’t let you see
that out of everything you are arises mystery
back to the intro , back to the back of the back of the door i watched you close
colors washed by the endless tides , by the end of the cycle faded slow
back to walls with the holes punched in by the ends of a fist with knuckles swole
back to the chick that lost control , back to the pain that can’t be shown
whatever i feel for you
you only seem to care about you
is there any chance you could see me too ?
cause i love you
is there anything i could do
just to get some attention from you ?
in the waves i've lost every trace of you
where are you ?
everything i feel for you , swallowed salted tears for you
is there any chance you can feel this too
now my heart’s a bid for you , you put all your quid onto
i just want you to make me a part of you
whatever i feel for you
you only seem to care about you
is there any chance you could see me too ?
cause i love you
is there anything i could do
just to get some attention from you ?
in the waves i've lost every trace of you
where are you ?
or can’t be seen or can’t be felt
or can’t be shared with no one else
i chose my shade , i made it green
i lost myself , when i made your team
back to the name i’ll scream forever from a place that can’t be home
safe from the grasp of the rage ensued by a thought process that can’t be slowed
where ill be when you realize , i can’t say
but dawn goes down today and nothing gold can stay
( but dawn goes down today and nothing gold can stay. )
( but dawn goes down today and nothing gold can stay. )
whatever i feel for you
you only seem to care about you
is there any chance you could see me too ?
cause i love you
is there anything i could do
just to get some attention from you ?
in the waves i've lost every trace of you
where are you ?
