i'm in that new school , g5 wagon
color , komodo dragon
my bitch look like she jasmine
my nigga look like aladdin
nkotb , bitch
all these bitches is has - beens
i cpr'd the game
and now all these bitches is gasping
i be on that other
nigga , don't get me aggy
i'm mrs. fatality
endings do not be happy
these loser - ass bitches know i never gotta stunt
talk behind my back
cause they never in the front
bitch bow down
better give me what i want
feed me berries out in paris
while i'm counting my croissant
these bitches is awful
and me i spit that gospel
that lyrical , biblical , holy ghost , pentecostal
and bitch don't run up on me
i give the fade to who want me
and you don't want that shade
you better off where it's sunny
and i don't need no friends bitch
i'm better off with my money
just alert the fucking masses
let 'em know that it's coming , like
( i was wearing it first )
i'm on that " fuck what you say
it's my way "
fashion week , i'm out here slaying
dressed in , like , all the latest
bitch , you know my money long
everybody sing this song
( i'm not even concerned )
i'm on that " fuck what you say
it's my way "
fashion week , i'm out here slaying
dressed in , like , all the latest
killing these motherfuckers
and shitting on all these haters
i'm in that new school , g5 wagon
color , komodo dragon
riding beside a baddie that only cares about fashion
i'm in that new school , r8 spyder
i'm now known as messiah
riding beside a baddie that only wants to get higher
i'm that brand new murci√©lago
on my way out to cabo
riding beside a baddie that's never once left toronto
yo , i like to brag alone
fuck dudes in rag and bone
obsess over chicks who look like mary - kate & ashley clones
helmut lang & philiph lim
trashy bitch in classy clothes
pop that shit then pop them pills
'til i feel like a fancy drone
never catch me at the club
i get high and dance alone
bitch i'm on that boss shit
on that upper echelon
y'all niggas know what kind of x i'm on
y'all bitches scared get your sweatshop on
and i'm running everything with a motherfuckin' sprain
watching the rest of y'all get your rest stops on
everybody sing this song
everybody sing this song
everybody sing this song
