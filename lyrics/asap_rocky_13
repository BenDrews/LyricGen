i write my shit by myself
i write this shit for myself
pen and pad for my health
and i don’t need me no help
he on the track thirty thousand miles , fly low stealth
and i dun’ suffered long days nigga , god knows well
best rapper in my family word to mikel
made it past 25 nigga n’ i ain’t dead or in jail
got thick skin and burn marks cause i done walked through hell
and on the winning squad nigga we don’t take no l’s
and when your life be lookin' dark just know your light still dwell
and when you waiting at the docks just know your ship gon’ sail
the label gotta cut the cheque you know this shit gon’ sell
it’s too visceral to imagine if way too real
it’s like mos def got gold chains and permanent grills
and diamonds on them bbs’s and they shine when he grill
and i just hope they know them bullets and them choppers is real
i’m down forty million dollars and i’m plottin’ for real
i feel like pusha t my album soundin’ just like pharrell
the young brother broke the records for the streams and the sales
and did it all with his real name and being himself
prayer meditation dope from them asteroid belts
all them gold medals round his neck is that michael phelps ?
he seek solitude and silence nigga been by himself
young rich ass nigga fuck you bitch ass nigga’s
tryin to hop on this ride this ain’t six flags nigga
young rich ass nigga fuck you bitch ass nigga’s
tryin to hop on this ride this ain’t six flags nigga
black ski mask i dont bang flags nigga
i wake up victorious most wins like the warriors
put my packs in the corridor
spit them pictures them polaroids
bad bitches in corduroys rollies and rolls royces
all of these bad choices and all of these fuck niggas
i feel i got no homies my life is so like lonely
cry me a fuckin’ river and give me a hundred billion
so i can go i can go there forever , travel to distant planets
go make me a turkey sandwich and told her not in kansas
they jealous my superpowers , they crackers they colin powell
give em a golden shower then lie to em bout the towers
while smokin’ on austin powers , the evil that i devour
the demons that i discovered i feel like i’m l. ron hubbard
i’m lethal like danny glover don't got no father no mother
i’m big boi and andre cousin i slept outside in the public
i cry myself to sleep lightly then them tears turn to lightning
now it’s bape jordan nike just had to change up my psyche
i invested in my spirit residuals in my pocket
i feel like chance the rapper these labels they cannot stop it
i’m a fashion icon isa asap rocky
i’m a black gorilla hate you niggas young black nazi
and that’s on everything i love
fuck you niggas
come against me and mine my nigga
if i gotta go i’m taking at least three or four of you with me
