ridin' around in my lotus , sitting back and i'm focused
on that west side - hocus pocus
nigga see them pipes , coming out at night
niggas acting crazy , we don't really fight
hit back with them hammers , watch out for them cameras
niggas coming through , popo put you in them slammers
i ain't got no time , i ain't doin' no crime
why you're talking to me , i ain't' dropping no dime
sitting back in my shirt , givenchy on my back
sitting in the mid of yonkers , bringing the dog back
l o x is here , we back up in here

weird green hair chicks from venus on my penis
twisting up our fingers , you know who my team is
starch em up and fold em then we treat them like them cleaners
used to push the jag stolen tags , scrape the serial
mouth rose , top row full of gold material
88 back bass bumping through your stereo
chicken noodle soup and mixing soda with the cereal
white like milk got beige like a cheerio
pancakes and purple syrup and my breakfast is complete
new black scale shit that complement that fleece
reeboks red - bottoms straight from swizzy on my feet
we some billionaire boy in some billionaire boys club
plus probably push a 'gatti that's the billionaire's toy huh
