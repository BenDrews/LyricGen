yg : alright , come whoop me nigga , i’m right here nigga
bang my line when you know what’s up
unnamed caller : fo sho , alright
it was 1 in the mornin' and i was up yawnin'
moms asked where i'm goin' , to the hood if you ain't knowin'
pops locked up so mama couldn't stop me
i was out the house , asap rocky
and it wasn't cause she couldn't control us
we was her babies , she just wanted to hold us
and we ain't get disciplined , her friend started whisperin'
about how she was a bad mama , mama said " fuck 'em then "
i was in the streets stylin' , nobody could tell me nothin'
grandpa or grandma , not my auntie or my favorite cousin
i was buzzin'
fuckin' all these hoes wearing no condoms , no nothin'
i used to ditch school when the homie had the chevy
i used to sneak and smoke stress weed
but now i'm rollin' on dubs
how you feel , whooptie woop , nigga , what ?
now i'm rollin' on dubs
how you feel , whooptie woop , nigga , what ?
all these hoes showin' love
how you feel , whooptie woop , nigga , what ?
all these hoes showin' love
how you feel , whooptie woop , nigga , what ?
skkkrrrt , i was on a mission
on a mission to the money , sun down till it sunny
know my family love me
ridin' in the car with two niggas and a pistol
this ain't funny , i do it all for the money , hold up
slowly as i pull up to the donut stand , i already know the plan
hop out and get on your mans and take what he got
go through pockets , wallets and socks , dig all the knots
it's a stick - up , phone ring , it's my mama
in the middle of some drama , so i don't pick up
thinking i gotta get my shit up , i gotta pick my bitch up
let's hurry up and leave , i feel the police near us
so we left with a thousand dollars cash
it was me and my nigga , so you know i went half
then shit get real when niggas get greedy
pop , pop , pop , pow , that's when he leave me
