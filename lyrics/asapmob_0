start from the beginning
turn my headphones up
get it squad
squad , gang gang
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe
packs , i sold , had them buzzing on the road
crack residue in the buttons on my phone
black leather boots when i run into your home
ring , ring , pussy , it's your mummy on the phone
niggas wanna kill me , tell them " go and get your uzi "
bari got the weapon in the pocket of the ksubiâ€™s
see me on the catwalk , you see me in the movies
still you can end up dead when you disrespect the goonies
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe
the traphouse was a shithole , with my niggas
smokin' on some indo , looking for the police through the window
said i'll be a minute , of course i was an hour
never disturb a baker when he's mixing up the flour
devour these criminals , stepping on my toes
i step into the party , i let everybody know
the heat will bang for a legend on the roads
so keep your hands off my bredrins and my clothes
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe
you say you always got the toast
but when you see my niggas you look like you see a ghost
these niggas follow fashion , don't look comfy in their clothes
see them on the roads getting lovey dovey with the hoes
i'll put you in your place , forreal , you disrespect the clique
bang brrrang dang dang , on my lil b shit
from soho to the heights , they're fuckin' with me heavy
they know me and my gang , we're the realest on the telly
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe for the block , not even for the cops
it ain't safe
