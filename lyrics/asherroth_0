" cause i ain't going out like a sucka , no way "
i'm nice right now
i - i feel good
if you have a drink
would you please put it in the air
that party last night
was awfully crazy , i wish we taped it
i danced my ass off
and had this one girl completely naked
drink my drink and smoke my weed
but my good friends is all i need
pass out at three , wake up at ten
go out to eat , then do it again
man , i love college
i wanna go to college for the rest of my life
sip bankers club , and drink miller lite
on thirsty thursday and tuesday night ice
and i can get pizza a dollar a slice
so fill up my cup , let's get fucked up ( let's get fucked up ! )
i'm next on the table , who want what
i am champion , at beer pong
allen iverson , hakeem olajuwon
don't even bounce , not in my house
better hope you make it , otherwise you naked
time isn't wasted , when you're getting wasted
woke up today , and all i could say is , um
man i love college ( hey ! )
and i love drinking ( hey ! )
i love women ( hey ! )
man i love college ( hey ! )
i can't tell you what i learned from school
but , i could tell you a story or two
um yea , of course i learned some rules
like don't pass out with your shoes on
and don't leave the house , 'til the booze gone
and don't have sex , if she's too gone
when it comes to condoms put two on
then tomorrow night , find a new jawn
hold the beer bong , nothing wrong with some fun
even if we did get a little bit too drunk
time isn't wasted , when you're getting wasted
woke up today , and all i could say is
now if everybody would please
put their drink , as high as they can
as high as they can , and repeat after me
chug ! chug ! chug ! chug !
chug ! chug ! chug ! chug !
freshmen ! freshmen !
freshmen ! freshmen !
do something crazy ! do something crazy !
do something crazy ! do something crazy !
keg - stand ! keg - stand !
keg - stand ! keg - stand !
( that party last night )
man i love college , i love it
( that party last night )
goodnight everybody
i gotta head back to class for a little bit
man i love college
but after that
you know what's goin' down
my house and 3 kegs
see you there , you're all invited
bring your friends , bring your mom
do i really have to graduate
or can i just stay here the rest of my life ?
