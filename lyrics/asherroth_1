they say that if it works , don't fix it
go against the law , might get a bit risky
no offense to y'all , but i feel a bit gifted
so i think my odds are about 50/50 , crispy
o.k. corral , we about to put it down
take 10 and turn around , go and pull your pistols out
but what is this about , all these grenades and handguns
magnús ver magnússon , strong set of hands , son
tall , dark , handsome , holding y'all for ransom
strong arm lance so scared that he can't run
cause when a man comes face to face with his fears
he gets weird , he can't hear , he can't see things clear
i be sincere , yes dear , guests here
press gear , dress queers , fresh in my neck beard
next year , net year , jet leer , get near
top tier , drop tears , no way not here
cause there's no crying in baseball , and that's that
" there'll always be a case called when ash rap
bars will take your face off , no cat scratch
go ahead , ask wreck racks on racks , yea that
for a pat on the back after i black
tackle and straddle a calf without impactin my breath
climb the ladder of success , skipping and missing a step
new edition of spittin' , you should've listened to flex , it's like
i try to tell them but they don't know
i try to tell them but they don't know
i try to tell them but they don't know , oh , no
i try to tell them but they don't know
i try to tell them but they don't know
i try to tell them but they don't know , oh , no
slick dickies , no one can stick with me
spit it out quick , as soon as the shit hits me
kill swiftly , been ill since stick stickley
double dip dibs , i dibble and bust quickies
nifty little shit , i do it while dressed thrifty
pricks just stiff , my stick is so shifty , sick
fred mcgriff with the hits coming lefty
used to be for free , now the seats never empty
it's elementary , yeah i heard it in assembly
principal was telling me i'd better go ahead and read
never be a better me , better off dead or me
not really a better , but i’m betting that i’ll better be
better with the rhetoric , set it up and let it rip
aw better forget it man , kid's a fucking lunatic
looney toon , lunar eclipse
every blue moon , might see a few shooting strips
