my girl wants to —
party all the time ( x3 )
my girl , she drinks and smokes , then she goes to fashion shows
forth and back , back and forth , takes the ( uh ) just like a pro
try to keep on up with her but really why bother
girl's a super hottie plus she parties way harder
still looking great with no make - up on
keep going strong 'til the break of dawn
eighth to the face , take it straight no chase
when she stay to the pace ain't a damn thing wrong
mother , sister , brother they insist on drinking water
but she's sipping on some liquor , janice dickinson had taught her well
hammered , you can hardly tell , stammered , but she hides it well
hands up in the air and yells " party all the time "
she dance around me in her thong , sing along , favorite song
rip a shot , hit the bong , going all night long
sorry little barbie who can hardly take a sip
yeah , my chick be drinking whiskey just to chase it with a kiss
then she'll charge it to her card , whole bar , plus tip
yeah for her and all her friends cause she never pays for shit
kind of chick that you see on the t.v. ( yeah )
real high heels and her cleavage ( yeah )
rolling up some homegrown asking " can we smoke some weed in here ? "
isn't like she needed it but got diamonds and pearls
and definitely ain't a lesbian but kisses other girls
drives a car that isn't hers , keeps the keys up in her purse
lipstick , red or pink , tell me which do you prefer ?
mini - skirts exotic furs wanna make the kitten purr
try to go and buy a drink but split before you finish yours , cause she
parties all the time , shorty she a dime
ass like nicki , barbie in her prime
stripping on that pole , shorty on her grind
i meet her in the bathroom , dog her from behind
it's the red cup sipping , cîroc boy mixing
bottles of that peach got that pussy all dripping
line goes down the street , room full of bad bitches
everybody super wasteful and them hoes is mad twisted
asher roth passed her off i had to ball , that ass was soft
i dribbled all on it like basketball
she nibbled all on it , i smashed i'm gone
it last through the morning and on through the night
11am i was off to a flight
land in your city it's all of the lights
i got them hoes rolling like all of the dice
