in the meadows where we grow the rose petals
and we sip a glass of merlot
while i blow the portabello
like cruello with a cigarillo

presto , go to infinity and beyond it
rhyme shit spitting gets imprinted on your conscious
ash , shit , this world's sitting in your palm
and it's important that you know this
so you never get it wrong
says my mom as she reads the tarot cards and the stars

lean in your seat
you'd think that they'd be leaping to see
a commercial mc keep an ear to the street
because jeez
we sick of watching all this shit go on
but this song ain't done yet , so son you start marching
a marksman , part marge , part bart simpson
but the other parts descartes , bars is raw wisdom
a lost art. i talk part of a larger mission
but you'd rather slack off with sharks than pay attention
so bark bark , another subpar spittin'

evil laugh
yeah , i've been playing phone tag for the last
6 months with my label , tell them fools to call me back
i play charades sippin' chardonnay fifty times a day
feeling great , can't wait to taste the marmalade
fade away , himalayan retreat to find me
good grief. loose leaf ? i treat it like bruce lee
