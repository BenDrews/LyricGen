someone's always caught up in the fast life
someone's always caught up in the fast life
fast life , someone's always caught up in the fast life
fast life , someone's always caught up in the fast life
far too delicate , it's hard when a father is yelling and
takes it out on her or the dog for the hell of it
only thirteen when she started developing
by fifteen , attractin' older gentlemen
she let them in , mom wasn't looking , she might have been
turned a blind eye found it better than fighting with
her little girl caught in a sinister world
no sibling or a sister that could show her the pearls
so she turns to the night sky
drinking to get by , pills above the sink that be helping her get high
all the while she's forgetting to ask why
feeling like the only way of living is let die
why goodbye is the hardest of speech
go along for the ride at a startling speed
through the rise and the fall and the valleys and peaks
while the heart tries to find what it needs
don't get caught up in the
fast life , someone's always caught up in the fast life
fast life , someone's always caught up in the fast life
fast life , someone's always caught up in the fast life
fast life , someone's always caught up in the fast life
ain't it hard , to get up out of your momma's basement
if i could buy my way to heaven or a diamond bracelet
can't help , but wonder if my time is wasted
if i'm waiting on a train instead of trying to race it
too fast , my lady told me , slow down baby
by the way i work for seven , she said she know i'm crazy , ayyy
how you gotta walk before you run
gotta look before you leap but lose faith before you preach
and just think before you reaching for the handle of your gun
and you running from what you done to become what you never wanted to
hunted you want to run , running from the sound of the sirens
chicago no violence , nobody could tell me
come find me , i need an island , to hold my family
take up ten rows of the grammy seats
granted we've known each other for some time
it don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine
look around
fast life , someone's always caught up in the fast life
fast life , someone's always caught up in the fast life
fast life , someone's always caught up in the fast life
fast life , someone's always caught up in the fast life
fast life , someone's always caught up in the fast life
fast life , someone's always caught up in the fast life
fast life , someone's always caught up in the fast life
fast life , someone's always caught up in the fast life
