akon and asher roth
they say they want that hot shhhh , say no more
had to walk around the block , couldn’t take no more !
like escaper from the rock , couldn’t wait no more
sean con cocked penis mightier than the sword
so i’m sleeping with the whores while i file for divorce
plain and simple and in short , when it rains , man , it pours
stepping in manure , second sippin in the moor
quickest leopard gets the boar , secret weapons win the war
guessed , but i’m pretty sure that i’m destined to endure
flesh into the core , pauly d to pauly shore
world of cyborgs and tours of cyberspace
what’s behind the door the allure something strange ?
of course , this is why i came , the forces are untamed
no corporate or dumb fame , i'll record for chump change
course is unphased , contorted or concave
i'm sort of a poor sport , nothing short of liu kang
got me feeling like
i fall and i rise , with the fire still in my eyes
my scars and my strife , you know i will survive
the strength that i find when i dig down deep inside
got me still in this fight , and i’ll be the last man standing !
oh , oh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh oh , oh oh , oh , hey hey hey !
oh , oh oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh oh , oh oh , oh , hey hey hey !
i tried conversing with god , but only hearing myself
i be throwing up a lot but i ain't here for my health
when i'm feeling like blah , i had to loosen my belt
ate the corn right off the cob , didn't need no help
so , now i've come to realize i'm on my own for real
so most of em i approach em with a slomin's shield
keep my enemies close cause they prone to steal
when friends become foes know you're doing it well
just keep it going
i'm a red pill taker , who's my real maker ?
group homes and tombstones to feel safer
loopholes for new souls , lets keep praying
too grown to complain , i create the lane i stay in
forever underrated , so now i'm nicholas cage - ing it
doing all about anything as long as you put my face in it
face it , i didn't want to be famous , but that's the way it is
way i play the game , no wonder the brother made it like
