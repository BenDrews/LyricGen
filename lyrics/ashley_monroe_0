i let your love in , i have the scar
i felt the razor against my heart
i thought we were both in all the way
but you caught it by the handle
and i caught it by the blade
you said " goodbye , it's not the end
and if you need me , i'm still your friend "
well , that's easy for you to say
cause you caught it by the handle
and i caught it by the blade
that's the risk you run when you love , when you love
and you give it all you've got to give
knowing all along there's a chance , there's a chance
you'll reach and they won't
you'll bleed and they don't
for you , it's over ; for me , it's not
i kept trying and you just stopped
now i know how you can sound so brave
cause you caught it by the handle , baby
and i caught it by the blade
that's the risk you run when you love , when you love
and you give it all you've got to give
knowing all along there's a chance , there's a chance
you'll reach and they won't
you'll bleed and they don't
i thought we were both in all the way
but you caught it by the handle
and i caught it by the blade
you caught it by the handle , baby
and i caught it by the blade
