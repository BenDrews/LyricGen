i could wait until you're sleeping , you'd never hear me leaving
go without saying a word
i could write it in a letter ; maybe it'd be better
who knows ? it could make it worse
save it for a rainy day
baby , either way , i'm damning it straight to hell
ten to three , you're half past nine
it'll never be a good time to drop a bombshell
if i did a little drinking , may numb me into thinking
i could tell you face to face
if i harden my heart , i'd tear us apart
so i wouldn't have to carry this weight
here on my shoulder
i'd tell you it's over 'stead of keeping it to myself
morning or midnight , it'll never be a good time
to drop a bombshell
i can't love you
i can't love you anymore
i can't love you
i can't love you anymore
driving through the smoke , out of the ashes
looking for a place to land
all that i know is i can't go back , so i'm driving fast as i can
picking up pieces , praying to jesus
lord , i'm gonna need your help
it ain't the easy way
there's always a price to pay for dropping a bombshell
ten to three , you're half past nine
it'll never be a good time
