woke up this morning in a cold , cold sweat
heart broke and beating out of my chest
i cried out your name against my will
a memory i can't kill
i buried your love alive ( buried your love alive )
i buried your love alive ( i buried your love alive )
i buried your love alive ( buried your love alive )
deep inside me , there's a shallow grave
that haunts me every day , yeah
i buried your love alive
getting tired and i don't wanna deal
you left me holding too damn much to feel
so i found a bottle , drank some booze
i did what i had to do , yeah
i buried your love alive ( buried your love alive )
i buried your love alive ( i buried your love alive )
i buried your love alive ( buried your love alive )
it drives me crazy and it makes me cry
wish i could make it die
i buried your love alive
yes , i did
i got what i wanted , i guess
i confess i did not want to let you go
so i buried your love alive
yeah , i buried your love alive
oh , no
oh , i buried your love alive ( buried your love alive )
oh , no ( i buried your love alive )
oh , no , i buried your love alive
woke up this morning in a cold , cold sweat
heart broke and beating out of my chest
i cried out your name against my will
a memory i can't kill
