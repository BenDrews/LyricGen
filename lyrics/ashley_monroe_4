i wouldn't be half lit drunk
digging 'round the danger
wrapping my number on a coaster
sliding it to a stranger
walking crooked justifying all my bad behavior
tangled up in someone's arms i know i won't see later
i wouldn't be getting good at getting good at staying calm
or sitting high and mighty on my broken throne
i wouldn't be cursing god for leaving me here all alone
i wouldn't be stuck between a rock and being stung
if love was fair
i'd be golden
cause you'd be there
i know it's patient
i know it's kind
but it wouldn't change its mind
if love was fair
i wouldn't be replaying what it was and what it wasn't
or thinking i could change if i only saw it coming
it wouldn't take everything i have to rise above it
there'd be some kind of peace
yeah , there'd be some kind of justice
if love was fair
i'd be golden
cause you'd be there
i know it's patient
i know it's kind
but it wouldn't change its mind
if love was fair
love is twisted
it has its rules
and i'd be over it like you
if love was fair
i'd be golden
cause you'd be there
i know it's patient
i know it's kind
but it wouldn't change its mind
if love was fair
