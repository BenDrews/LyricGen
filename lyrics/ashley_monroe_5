hush , little darling , celebrate
today's gonna be your birthday
even if it's not the 10th of september
sometimes down here you will find
life won't give you peace of mind
it's like you're holding on to a dying ember
someday , you'll be fine
sweet as wine
but it's alright to remember
i am where you're at
close your eyes and you'll see
that you'll remember
from time to time
hush , little darling , don't you cry
you're the apple of my eye
always have bene , always will be forever
you do things you think you don't
you can grow a rose right out of the winter
someday , you'll be fine
sweet as wine
but it's alright to remember
i am where you're at
close your eyes and you'll see
that you'll remember
from time to time
someday , you'll be fine
sweet as wine
but it's alright to remember
i am where you're at
close your eyes and you'll see
that you'll remember
from time to time
