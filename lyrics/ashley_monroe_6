wheels are gonna rust if they don’t turn enough
and so the story goes
yeah , i’ve been one of those worn and faded by the rain
days are gonna fly
draw lines around your eyes
it’ll make you bitter , it’ll make you wise
it’s coming either way
lost and found , i’m better dancing when i don’t look down
hard times roll up but they don’t hang around
i feel like i’m on to something good
i’m better moving on than going back
i’ll ride this train till it runs out of track
i feel like i’m on to something , something , something
i can’t tell you how or where i’m heading now
but , the winding of the road is steadying my soul
feels like i’m coming home
oh yeah
it’s in the wind that’s blowing , it’s in the red wine
life’s got it’s way of showing when it’s the right time
lost and found , i’m better dancing when i don’t look down
hard times roll up but they don’t hang around
i feel like i’m on to something good
i’m better moving on than going back
i’ll ride this train till it runs out of track
i feel like i’m on to something , something , something
oooh something , something
oooh something , something
lost and found , i’m better dancing when i don’t look down
hard times roll up but they don’t hang around
i feel like i’m on to something good
i’m better moving on than going back
i’ll ride this train till it runs out of track
i feel like i’m on to something , something , something
oh i feel like i’m on
oooh something , something
feel like i’m onto something
oooh something , something
