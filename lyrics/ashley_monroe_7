i'm out walking in dark alleys
searching for shadows in the valleys
you were my heaven , you were my home
so what am i supposed to do when heaven is gone ?
if the devil don't want me
where the hell do i go ?
if i can't see the light
in the neon glow
if there ain't enough whiskey
to kill the fire in my soul
if the devil don't want me
where the hell do i go ?
i've heard stories 'bout honky tonk angels
picking up pieces of broken strangers
i'm at rock bottom with a smoke and a sin
if the devil don't want me
where the hell do i go ?
if i can't see the light
in the neon glow
if there ain't enough whiskey
to kill the fire in my soul
if the devil don't want me
where the hell do i go ?
no , there ain't enough whiskey
to kill the fire in my soul
if the devil don't want me
where the hell do i go ?
