the weight of the load
brings everybody down
the rocks that they've thrown
are killing me now
when fear and doubts
are calling you out
well , i'll help you out
with the weight of the load
the hardest of hearts
still can change
alone in the dark
broken and stained
when fear and doubts
are calling you out
well , i'll help you out
with the weight of the load
when you're at the end of your road
thinking about giving up hope
true love's gonna find you
this much i know
with the weight of the load
the weight of the load
brings everybody down
the rocks that they've thrown
they're killing you now
when fear and doubts
start calling you out
well , i'll help you out
with the weight of the load
the weight of the load
the weight of the load
the weight of the load
i'll help you out
with the weight of the load
i'll help you out
