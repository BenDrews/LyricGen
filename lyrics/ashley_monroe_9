i got a good foundation
on a bad reputation
got a floor i've been pacing
and a broken heart breaking
in a game of fools
i'd be hard to beat
yeah , if losing's a game
i'm on a winning streak
i got a bottle that's empty
if i was me , i'd quit me
when i gambled my last 50
on a game of fools
but it ain't easy streak
yeah , if losing's a game
i'm on a winning streak
hey , hey , i'm on a roll
gone as low as a low can go
standing at the old crossroads
damned old devil won't buy my soul
hey , hey , i blow on the dice
this old town , it don't play nice
hit me once , hell , hit me twice
if losing's a game
i'm on a winning streak
yes , i am
well , my mind is unadjusted
and my guitar strings are rusted
had somebody that i trusted
leave me broke and busted
on a game of fools
now i'm drowning in defeat
yeah , if losing's a game
i'm on a winning streak
oh , baby , if losing's a game
i'm on a winning streak
hey , i'm on a roll
i'm on a roll now , child
i'm on a roll
i'm on a roll now , baby
hey , i'm on a roll
hey , i'm on a roll
hey , i'm on a roll now , baby
