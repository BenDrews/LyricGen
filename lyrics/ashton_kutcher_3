do you hear voices screaming sacred mourning ?
deal with what's withering away from me
call out the problems and the flaws dishonest
then can you deal with consequence of the end
go , runaway
from a world you couldn't control so don't
say save my soul
from the truth that's killing the faith
question the motives of controlled corruption
now take a look at yourself again
does it feel empty and/or inconsistent ?
does it seem like his work is done all in vane ?
