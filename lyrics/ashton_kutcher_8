i'm from a grimy city from a bunch of miles away
with no regard for the laws , i'm from a sovereign state
from a murderous block , swerving in the convertible drop
hoping niggas heard my proverbial plots
i'm trying to take over the world like pinky the brain
my 'preme mistress is a bitch like pinky with brains
or roxy reynolds , i stick dick into her
she suck cock for a living , tongue kiss with murs
but i don't feel anger
so like the frame of the nickel - plated chrome four - five , i'mma still bang her
original renegade , niggas been afraid
more niggas follow than ashton kutcher's twitter page
chowder time - - y'all write , i sprinkle powder lines
if kelly beat his case , my lawyer gonna swallow mines
so put your nines on the crap table
you like gambling - - i'm patron sipping , signed to black label
champagne wishes become realities
bad bitches , fly minus the travel needs
my dick is the biggest thing on my anatomy
i dis niggas for nothing like , " why you mad at me ? "
nickel is still reckless
the last nigga got killed that made me feel threatened
who really cares what a rapper talking ?
the only feeling that ain't familiar is after losses
i shoot a nigga dead in the head , and go back to boston
with a trunk full of white , i call it asher roth'n
feel honored if i talk about your ass often
you should wanna sleep in the bed i was jacking off in
it's a reason these motherfuckers is backing off 'im
he floyd mayweather , paul williams , and chad dawson
all rolled up in one , his money trash - talking
amongst bosses , hanging out in the cash office
nigga , you testing the one - - nickel second to none
i'm hotter than texas at three , i'm effecting the sun
i don't just sound raw
i disconnect your shit , have you walking around with bobby brown jaw
and then whitney said crack was wack
and it offended me like , floozy , why you dissing my music ?
and you can ask proof , we come from chopper city
minus the wack suit and the beef with ness
forever inhaling the smell of that sweet success
that calico talking , saying , " we the best ! "
i'm the fed - teaser
this bitch said , " who the fuck died and made you god ? "
i said jesus
i'm in the zone , i feel like a star
and nigga , you know what to do if you feel like a frog
go on , jump in that traffic , you playing frogger
i ain't no blogger , i'm mr. rearrange - your - aura
niggas thinking all we got is internet soldiers
'09 is the fear year - - respect's over
the o.g.s taught me how to do it one way
so i ain't down for no games unless it's gunplay
niggas'll murder judges over murder grudges
i don't put money on heads , i just refer to cuz's
i drop dope records that's hot like a furnace
the needle on that record player is hypodermic
receive food from an intravenous tube
kill your ass in private , between me and you
i'm sick enough to go up in your house
sickening rhymes , i spit 'em and throw up in my mouth
you fucking round with the slaughterhouse conglomeron
like catching your parents fucking , i leave you traumatized
the beef live til the drama dies
my daughter can get struck by lightning if i ain't down for homicide
i'm one of one
i promise there ain't another nigga built in my pedigree
rappers ain't a threat to me
take my words how you wanna - - it's the easiest extortion you gonna ever see
just worship , mission won't get diverted
say mouse , you're fucking with niggas that you know'll get murdered
started in my youth , i blame streetfighter 2
back when winning wasn't nothing , nigga had to get a perfect
roasting me , zero is what they gross to me
no ratchet on 'im , i'm protected by a rosary
i don't pay mind to the vets and what they throw at me
i ain't hear a word they say , it's deaf poetry
call l.a. reid , craig kallman , rifkind , sylvia , e1 and get alan
alert the geek squad and call the goons
all the bullshit in the game , only thing they wanna kill is fucking autotune
but before you gun it down
know they only say hip hop is dead - - the dope shit is underground
radio , shotty to its wig
and tell fab i can't put it in a bag cause the body too big
listen , some haters out there wanna snatch me up
working with half they head , got a cassie cut
aware of the scene
they don't look my way , i mirror dreams
they car note and rent is my pair of jeans
street , i don't be around those narcs
bloggers keep typing as if they could download heart
let's begin with common sense , don't make it sound so sharp
nigga , if you see a fin , you around those sharks
this a funeral , this how fans cry for the beat
tired of hearing how you hired with the heat
every verse lame , about his great aim and how he snipe in the streets
but every time he take a piss , end up wiping the seat , pause
i make sure it's no women , no kids in sight
phone call'll make his address demolition site
yes - men do whatever your battery say
a dream can't tell make up - - my anatomy's gray
nigga , tell me who keep it hotter for jerz
y'all picked the wrong group to bother with words
think niggas got a lot of nerve
it's magic , you skip
i'm jameer , my spot's reserved
your spot's a reserve
niggas is scared of the truth
look in my eyes , you stare at the truth
they doing interludes in any interview
talking bout how they prepared to shoot
how thoughtful , won't resort to getting near a booth
thought so - - what i do to 'em unlawful
boss dude , ain't got a higher - up to resort to
just giving yourself a bad name
yakety - yak them threats ; in fact , it's that lame
if you can't tell that act's arranged
think i'm wearing a bulls - eye and just all them cats got bad aim ?
i'll explain - - i'm past real , niggas is past phony
avoid the personal and physical attacks on me
i remain cool - - relaxed , homie
brand new , i ain't got a scratch on me
so what your squad gon' do ?
lay a hand on me , i lay a hollow on you
chain snatch , tap his pockets , take his wallet , go through
every club in new york and pop bottles on you
better tell him what reluctance is
i'm controlled by uncontrolled substances
truth be told , i show em what substance is
i know i'm nice , so when i boast i'm only rubbing it in
niggas got beat up , ignored in school
signed a deal , niggas thought you was cool
only take one quarter to slaughter your crew
if they resumes got deaded today
they'd call you a fool
got all them years rapping , nothing else happening
you need a new day - to - day
old heads in the game with no other way to get paid
they gasping , time out , gon take a break from the clay
and grab a gatorade
bad contract , team can't make a trade
majors fucking you in the ass , you gonna stay a slave
5'9 " in my ear saying , " hey , behave "
but shit is fucked up , and i blame it on the way it was paved
i'll chill for the sake of your age
you great live , but let me know when that stage get appraised
all in , raising the stakes
swear you and your label should pray to god i was placed in this decade by mistake
i don't belong here
dad fucked mom in the wrong year
wrong nigga amongst fans with wrong ears
wrong trends , with funny sounds every song's weird
wrong fashion , it's like every nigga's gone queer
mic check , one thing that i could do is spit
i'll hammer you mcs quick , y'all ain't too legit
you interfere with my guap , your medulla's split
y'all wilding , my stomach growling like the rudest pit
for being so smart , i stay on some stupid shit
but if dummies make a smart comment , i'm dumping ruger clips
and i keep it true with fifths
i give your eye a cookie
and punch the cookie , just see just how black and blue it gets
yaowa ! i'm in tune with what the gutter loves
i hop on beat and son niggas like a mother does
they hear me , they like , " hey yo , that brother's bug "
they hear you , they like , " oh no , not another thug "
you chase the bitches who don't wanna scrub
i done fucked project bitches on my roof with a rubber glove
we two different dudes
i be praised , you be getting booed
i feed niggas , you just niggas' food
all you do is get chewed like wack grits
every time i get chewed , it's a bad bitch
oh , i'm fronting - - sometimes i choose some average
but that's six jacks and coke in the spot , and she the last bitch
and i just couldn't bag shit
she just stuck around cause she on my fat - ass dick
ha ! i'm just fucking 'round , green
but i feel good , basically jay - z in the underground scene
listen - - i'm in a zone of my own , my condolences
to anyone or any group that's opposing this
this ain't a song , this a movement - - we controlling this
you can't beat us , we don't want you to join us
so move over , bitch
it's our time , the tides done came in
please exit the water , you'll die if you can't swim
this music's a novel , you still on page ten
i read it , rewrote it , and published it , called it amen
see , ortiz is the lord's gift to this four - fifth bullshit that y'all worship
i'm a lyrical warship
and god forbid i should fall from up off this boat
i'll land in the water , come up and finish you with a swordfish
this hip - hop is my office , believe i go to work
and when i promote it , this cd's almost over , jerk
i sit there and write to a track until my shoulders hurt
and when both arms is done , i put my toes to work
you gotta hear what i gotta say , i'm just like that
from what i'm hearing this day and age , i don't like rap
i was a fan , i used to love this shit
but y'all getting away with murder , like the glove don't fit
y'all either flossing or talking like savages
i don't mention a coffin or doggie , i'm not having it
you niggas rapping is fractions below average
i don't care what the fuck you can do with a little half a brick
i did some things i ain't proud of to support mine
left that on the street - - on beat ain't where you talk crime
plus you lying - - whenever you on the court line
it's to pay a ticket for parking your whip on the wrong side
thugs is somewhere doing what it is that thugs do
rappers is rapping , and y'all ain't doing that - - what the fuck is you ?
you're bluffing , you's nothing , you're stuffing on thanksgiving
my tummy is hungry , i'll put you on a plate - - listen
i'm making it hard like a blowjob with great rhythm
i know joey gon' pause me , but i ain't even trying to play with 'im
feed 'em this money , they handing out a changed living
project is ugly , i daily barely escaped prison
i was starting to feel pinned down like a rape victim
wishing for a deal , trying to deal with the fact that i hate wishing
