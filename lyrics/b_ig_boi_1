as the world shakes unharmed
twan , calm in the middle of the storm bomb
flow tsunami , ring the alarm
big boi for dummies come and get some
uhh , wisdom , like yo back teeth
or get the fuck on , like some bad chi
negative energy not tolerated
you all about a dollar and i'm exonerated
freefalling , tom petty heartbreaker
living legend , rap scholar , art major
cause i make major art
like beethoven , van gogh , or mozart so don’t start
around these parts we reign supreme
and stay krispy kreme clean
blue jeans , jordans
number 3's , that’s important
be careful how you play your cards ( my mama told me )
be true to self and you’ll go far ( that's what mama told me )
try not to break too many hearts ( that's what mama told me )
i always knew i’d be a star ( that’s what mama told me )
mama used to say take your time
well i’m a pickpocket when i design rhymes
every little step i take like bob brown
it's so profound that when i throw those nouns
we gon' get low low down until we get back up
everything gravy , taters mashed up
you know i keep a full plate
and a full thing of hot ones , throw away 38's
but everything's straight , bleed , shit
i got everything i can need
me , boy , i’m everything you can’t see
like three blind mice , on the chase of some great cheese
and cheddar man say he got some great trees
say he serve me and my nigga three g
fatigues , jordans , number 5 , you niggas boring
cause i travel like a rocket , i do
mind riddle every socket for you
i sway on the edge of the lightning
magnetic , can’t stop
just floating won’t drop
i slip ( i slip ) i slide ( i slide )
back up the ride
i skippin' every mountaintop
i'm reachin' for the highest high
