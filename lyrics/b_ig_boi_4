it is i , the b - i - g , the b - o - i
me oh my , ears to the street and eyes to the sky
kept my sights on the prize , wide open , world wide
like the thighs of a hooker spread , told the girl bye
i got bigger fish to fry , niggas wish i would retire
cause of the pressure i apply every time i bust a rhyme
none of the rest of ya are tryin , watch me stimulate the minds of the masses
while you niggas kickin it like jackasses
and who you votin for , republican or democratic ?
don't say it doesn't matter cause that's how they stole the last one
assassin's bullet might be waitin for obama
do you think they'll have a brother before billy's baby mama ? c'mon !
