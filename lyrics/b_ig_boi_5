i keep it playa while some choose to play it safe
boy check the resume , it's risky business in the a
and i been witness to this history , ever since the 10th grade
we went from rockin' braids to temp fades
i twist my a hat to the side just for style
or throw on the gucci bucket with the flowers , super fly
wow , the southern pride been known to shut it down
it ain't so country though nigga , this ain't no gomer pyle
i'm sergeant slaughter , i keep my shit cooked to order in order
to satisfy my people in georgia and 'cross the water
and across the border the eses are gettin' smarter
they got flour for tortillas and lettuce for enchiladas
if you follow , wink wink , no doubt , we don't speak
in a blink those folks could have you sleeping in the clink
i'm shittin' on niggas and peein' on the seat
it's that nigga the b - i - g b - o - i , o - u - t
now party people in the club it's time to cut a rug
and throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbuggs
i'm double fisted and you empty , you can grab a cup
boy stop , i'm just playin' let me dap you up
baby baby , you're in my system
baby baby , tell me you're listenin'
it's after 12 club like a hive be
a beehive cause now everybody buzzing around me
could it be the way that the verse is sounding
came up on the geto boys and the underground kingz
toys , i had a brougham , call it " pretty brown thing "
paint look like root beer when the sun was shining
known to keep a bad bitch no niggas beside me
index this finger on the trigger in case niggas is clowning
not to flex but to protect my neck like the wu - tang
self preservation is the rule when you do aim
or get at something more sinister , you gotta be the finisher
make it so the doctors they can't replenish him
or bring him back to life , back to reality
go on , get him some hoes , leave it alone
triple og status , a - town's very own
now party people in the club it's time to cut a rug
and throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbuggs
i'm double fisted and you empty , you can grab a cup
boy stop , i'm just playin' let me dap you up
baby baby , you're in my system
baby baby , tell me you're listenin'
now this goes out to all my playas in the back
sippin' yac , bending 'round corners in the 'lac
cut a rug , playa now , cut a rug
throw your deuces in the sky for the shutterbugg
this goes out to all my ladies in the front
what you want ? girl you make me want too breed , girl freeze
cut a rug , cut a rug
throw your deuces in the sky for the shutterbugg
now party people in the club it's time to cut a rug
and throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbuggs
i'm double fisted and you empty , you can grab a cup
boy stop , i'm just playin' let me dap you up
baby baby , you're in my system
baby baby , tell me you're listenin'
tell me you're listenin'
cause you're all up in my system
i can feel you from my head to my toes , my toes you are in my system
luscious leftfoot got his best foot forward

how the flow stay so cold , froze tell me your listening
cut a rug , cut a rug , shutterbugg
