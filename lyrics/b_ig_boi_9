i used to be in lust , i wouldn’t call it love
or give my heart away , that’s somethin’ that i never does
see i’ma leave it to the scrubs and the cake boss
let that broad go , uncuff her , take your cape off
when she with me , she feel free , like her days off
balls in her hand , but that bitch don’t ever say cough
'less we playin’ doctor
with no stethoscope , just heels and those knockers yeah
i’m mister wrong but she sure know not to
get fly at the mouth , or step outta pocket
never violence , i give ‘em silence
then i'll rub this stick on your chick like a violin
les françaises ont peint le portrait de celui qu'on appelle au états - unis : le mec au portefeuille remplis , et nous réclamons qu'il soit mis à sa place , au louvre
it's all you want these days cause you feel nothing inside
you know there's nothing wrong , but you've been wondering why
i’m daddy fat saxxx , s - a triple x
my music sounds so good it’s almost like we’re having sex
whether you like it or not i’m next
and i got the time after that , and the time after that
because see time and time again i gotta turn back around and tell ‘em
my cerebellum , get way more deeper than these other fellas
not only about cheddar
but what about the seasons never change and the weather stays the same
we could come together but that might be lame , could learn something
peep game , nah nigga burn somethin’
( nah nigga burn somethin’ )
( nah nigga burn somethin’ )
i ask for a slice of her pie
sweet potato with the cool whip , oh my
she gave me a hug and on her thigh she felt my buddy
from touching i’m excited
am i invited
let let me in
you puddled up
gon’ let me swim
it’s all you want these days , cause you feel nothing inside
you know there’s nothing wrong , but you’ve been wondering why
i read the horoscope , and it’s been telling me lies
i thought i knew you but your heart is almost blind
i thought i knew you but your heart is blind
i thought i knew you but your heart is almost blind
i thought i knew you but your heart is blind
