you are the apple of my eye
na , i don't like that
you're the wheels to my ride , keeps me goin'
see i know that she ain't heard nothin' like this
you're my moon in the night , you be glowin'
cause ain't no better feelin' whenever we kiss
there's so many things i want to say
but i lose the words when i see your face
they say writing letters is so old fashioned
but this is the best way to describe my affection
i'm writing you this letter
no text , no emails , something real , something you can feel
i'm writing you this letter
all the reasons i think we should be together
i'mma sit down with this pen and make a list
of all the things i think you should know
even though they don't do this no more , cause you're worth it
i'm writing you this letter
and once that ink hits you , you can keep this thing forever
you're the air that i breathe , the words that i speak
without you baby , what would i do ?
you're the j's on my feet , jeans and my tee
without you by my side i just ?
and the things it would say if my heart could speak
i'mma write down all my poems like a diary
girl my love's an open book , now it's yours to keep
i write it down just so you can see
i'mma sit down with this pen and write this letter
