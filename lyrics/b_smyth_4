verse 1
pull up at two a.m text you to buzz me in open the door in your lingerie , can't help but look at your body still faded off of these drinks that i been sippin , can't wait to slip in touch you all kind of ways so as we get started that when you hear your phone ringing and your girls calling don't pick it up to see if they're straight aye and imma start stroking fast pace and i go deeper when you answer aye ! , put a little grin on my face aye cause i know im killing that waist aye now you turned your phone off we can keep on going don't need no distractions they can wait
