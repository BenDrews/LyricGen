ohhhhh , yeah , ohhhh
diamond in the back , sun roof top
diggin the scene with a gangsta lean
yeah rooftop , seen a couple friends at the bar baby
oh , and on my mind all i'm thinking 'bout is who i'm taking home with me
oh , shoulder rubs , i'm going through the motions
and i guess we can call it the pregame , oh
but now we on the clouds , got you gripping on my jock
jack on the rocks , and we ain't even get back to the car
oh , well she just wanna show love , give a fuck 'bout the finer things
oh yeah , she just wanna do drugs , roll something and get high with me
oh , she just wanna show love , she can't wait for us to leave the scene
i'm leaving gold wrappers on the nightstand , she my one night fan
i'm leaving gold wrappers on the nightstand , oh
you get the foreign cars and the foreign bags
she avoid the black fridays and all the sale tags
say she found that out , funny through my snaps
realise i was a hustler , now she love my raps
the filly only focused for the time being
mansions and motels and cities i'm dying to see
saw your best friend , she offered me her phone number
iced out , gave her ass the cold shoulder
i represent you cause you represent me
it all come to light how we move in the streets
rubbing on your neck and kissing on your knees
gold wrappers , we rolling up , we twisting trees
but now we on the clouds , got you gripping on my jock
jack on the rocks , and we ain't even get back to the car
oh , well she just wanna show love , give a fuck 'bout the finer things
oh yeah , she just wanna do drugs , roll something and get high with me
oh , she just wanna show love , she can't wait for us to leave the scene
i'm leaving gold wrappers on the nightstand , she my one night fan , ohhhhhhhh , ohhhhh
i'm leaving gold wrappers on the nightstand , ohhhh
body to body , the mind is numb
round after round , i need more than one
promise no illusions no fantasies
panties fall down , like some autumn leaves
body to body , the time has come
going all night until the morning sun
ruby rue red lipstick on me
call up the uber cause it's time to leave
oh , she just wanna show love , give a fuck 'bout the finer things
oh yeah , she just wanna do drugs , roll something and get high with me
ohhhh , she just wanna show love , she can't wait for us to leave the scene
i'm leaving gold wrappers on the nightstand , she my one night fan , ohhhhhh , ohhhhhh
i'm leaving gold wrappers on the nightstand , ohhhhh
