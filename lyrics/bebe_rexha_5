you hit me up at 3 a.m. on a friday night
say you ain't feelin' right
you need to see my face right now
you ain't over it , just wanna talk a bit
if you wanna talk , let's talk about the way you left me
left me with a text so cold ( yeah )
even though i'd die to see you
i don't trust myself to meet you
'cause we both know
that your kiss is a gateway drug
once you get one , it's never enough
your kiss is a gateway drug
once you get one , it's never enough
'cause
kissin' leads to touchin' leads to
lovin' leads to fuckin' leads to
someone always seems to get hurt ( yeah )
kissin' leads to touchin' leads to
lovin' leads to fuckin' leads to
everythin' mean nothin'
your kiss is a gateway drug
you said that you loved me
if you really loved me , why'd you leave me like that
why'd you go around and talk shit like that
behind my back , love don't do shit like that , ooh

left me with a text so cold ( mm )
