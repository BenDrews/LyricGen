you said , " let me try you on "
so i let you try me on
that's the moment that we fell in deep
oh , baby
i said , " just a little bit "
then i got a taste of it
now you got me fallin' at your feet
and now we're cryin' and lovin'
and now we're fightin' and touchin'
feels like i'm makin' love to the enemy
i can only take you in small doses , small doses
loving you , it's explosive , you know this
i can only take you in small doses , small doses
loving you , it's explosive , you know this
i can only take you in small doses
i didn’t mean to fall in love
took one hit , and i was gone
gotta get my fix or i can't sleep
oh , baby
you’re the one they warned about
now i just can't do without
baby , it's my appetite you feed
and now we're cryin' and lovin'
and now we're fightin' and touchin'
feels like i'm makin' love to the enemy
i can only take you in small doses , small doses
loving you , it's explosive , you know this
i can only take you in small doses , small doses
loving you , it's explosive , you know this
i can only take you in small doses
small doses , small doses
i can only take you in small doses
small doses , small doses
and now we're cryin' and lovin'
and now we're fightin' and touchin'
feels like i'm makin' love to the enemy
i can only take you in small doses , small doses
loving you , it's explosive , you know this
i can only take you in small doses , small doses
loving you , it's explosive , you know this
i can only take you in small doses
small doses , small doses
i can only take you in small doses
small doses , small doses
i can only take you in small doses
