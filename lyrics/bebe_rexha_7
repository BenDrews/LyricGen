i've seen better days , better towns
my love's been all used up , and it brings me down
can't seem to get it right , this wretched life
broken promises , now i realize
oh , it's just me , myself and i
solo ride until i die
'cause i got me for life
oh , i don't need no hand to hold
even when the night is cold
i got that fire in my soul
i don't need anything to get me through the night
except the beat that's in my heart
and it's keeping me alive
i don't need anything to make me satisfied
'cause the music does me good and it gets me every time
like ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba
'cause the music does me good and it gets me every time
taste that bitter taste , and wash it down
i'll make that bitter place a little sweeter now
i'm done with compromise , it's overdue
take my memories , take my tears
so over you
oh , it's just me , myself and i
solo ride until i die
'cause i got me for life
oh , i don't need no hand to hold
even when the night is cold
i got that fire in my soul
i don't need anything to get me through the night
except the beat that's in my heart
and it's keeping me alive
i don't need anything to make me satisfied
'cause the music does me good and it gets me every time
like ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba
'cause the music does me good and it gets me every time
ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba
'cause the music does me good and it gets me every time
