i don't wanna grow up , no
i don't wanna grow up
i'm still naive
young , wild and free
i don't wanna hear it , no
i don't wanna feel it
don't lecture me
just let me be
if love is a lie
it's the most beautiful lie that you've ever been told
cause nothin' , nothin' makes me feel like you do
even though i see through you
if love is a lie
then please don't ever tell me the truth
cause nothin' , nothin' makes me feel like you do
even though i see through you
i don't wanna live it , no
i don't wanna live it
reality
just not for me
like cheap tequila
makes you sick but it tastes so good
it is good on your lips , take a sip
just one more hit
i love it when you do it , when you do it like this
when you do it , when you do it like this
if love is a lie
it's the most beautiful lie that you've ever been told
cause nothin' , nothin' makes me feel like you do
even though i see through you
if love is a lie
then please don't ever tell me the truth
cause nothin' , nothin' makes me feel like you do
even though i see through you
if love is a lie
it's the most beautiful lie that you've ever been told
cause nothin' , nothin' makes me feel like you do
even though i see through you
( if love is a lie , is a lie )
if love is a lie
it's the most beautiful lie that you've ever been told
cause nothin' , nothin' makes me feel like you do
even though i see through you
if love is a lie
then please don't ever tell me the truth
cause nothin' , nothin' makes me feel like you do
even though i see through you
( c'mon , c'mon , c'mon )
