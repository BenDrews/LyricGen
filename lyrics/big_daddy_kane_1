on a cylindrical drum accompanied by staccato human tones
it has been his aim to add breadth and depth , to give realism
i start to go , my rhymes'll flow
so , get up and dance cause kane said so
if you were lounging around it's time to get up
pardon my expression , but i'mma tear shit up
i appear right here , and scare and dare , a mere musketeer
that would dare to compare , i do declare
getting busy is where it's at
but what you're saying , you wouldn't get a point for that
cause you're a featherweight , and your rhymes you carry light
but i drop bass just like barry white
so how could you think that you pose a threat ?
you say you're rocking , how many shows you get ?
all your vocals go local on the m - i - c
mines go a great distance , like at&t
i'm not new to this , i'm true to this , nothing you can do to this
fuck around with kane and come out black and blue for this
so , yo , go for what you know
attempt to debate so i can humiliate
we can go rhyme for rhyme , word for word , verse for verse
get you a nurse , too late , get you a hearse
to take you to your burial ground
because the big daddy kane always throws down
correct , i get respect , i'm out to collect
cash money , cause i get raw
everybody get up ! ( x4 )
kane : boy do i hate a...
i'm coming ! ( x5 )
here i am , r - a - w
a terrorist , here to bring trouble to
phony mc's , i move on and seize
i just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease
cause i'm at my apex and others are below
nothing but a milliliter , i'm a kilo
second to none , making mc's run
so don't try to step to me , cause i ain't the one
i relieve rappers just like tylenol
and they know it , so i don't see why you all
try to front , perpetrating a stunt
when you know that i'll smoke you up like a blunt
i'm genuine like gucci , raw like sushi
to stage a rage is what rap did to me
to make me want to create chaos and mayhem
cold rock a party until the a.m
i'll make a muscle , grab the mic and hustle
while you stand dazed and amazed , i bust a
little rhyme with authority , superiority
and captivate the whole crowd's majority
the rhymes i use definitely amuse
better than dynasty , or hill street blues
i'm sure to score adored for more without a flaw
cause i get raw
everybody get up ! ( x5 )
give a speech like a reverend , rappers start severing
and in my lifetime , believe i've never been
beaten , or eaten and just tooken out
you know , come to think about it , i keep mc's looking out
and real nervous when i'm at your service
give me that title , boy , you don't deserve this
i work like a slave to become a master
and when i say a rhyme , you know that it has to
be perfectly fitted , cause i'm committed
the entertainer and trainer and kane'll get with it
i go and flow and grow to let you know
i damage ya i'm not an amateur but a pro -
- fessional unquestionable without doubt superb
so full of action , my name should be a verb
my voice will float on every note
when i clear my throat , that's all she wrote !
the minute that the kane starts to go on
believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so on
as i put other rappers out of their misery
get them in a battle and make them all history
ruling and schooling mc's that i'm dueling
watch them all take a fall as i sit back cooling
on my throne , with a bronze microphone
hmm , god bless the child that can hold his own
cause i get raw
ain't it good to you ? ( x3 )
documentary : here's an experiment to begin with...
twenty - four sev chilling , killing like a villain
the meaning of raw is ready and willing
to do whatever is clever , take a loss , never
and the rhymes i bust , coming off is a must
and i come off hard with rhymes that are odd
i rip the microphone and leave it scarred
never smoking or hitting or taking a sniff
only crushing mc's that be trying to riff
i get strong and titanic , do work like a mechanic
make mc's panic , they all get frantic
and skeptic , like a girl on a contraceptive
as i rock but hey , what you expected ?
i'll get raw for you just like a warrior
rapping like a samurai and i'll be damned if i
ever let a fisher - price mc hang
their rhymes are toy , nothing but yin - yang
so if we battle on the microphone
bring your own casket and tombstone
and i'mma preach your funeral
tell me who in the world could ever come with more
i get raw
