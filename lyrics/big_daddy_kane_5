let it roll , get bold , i just can't hold
back , or fold cos i'm a man with soul
in control and effect , so what the heck
rock the discotheque and this groove is what's next
attack , react , exact , the mack'll move you with
a strong song , as long as you groove to this
i keep the crowd loud when you're hype
do damage onstage and injure the mic
as i shoot the gift mc's stand stiff
while my rhymes stick to you like skippy and jif
feel my blood fist , or my death kiss
the rap soloist , you don't want none of this
supreme in this era , i reign with terror
when i grab the mic believe you're gonna hear a
fascinatin' rhyme as i enchant them
so let's all sing the big daddy anthem
go with the flow , my rhymes grow like an afro
i entertain again and kane'll never have no
problem , i can sneeze , sniffle and cough
e - e - e - even if i stutter i'mma still come off
cos rappers can't understand the mics i rip
they sure enough ain't equipped , that's why they got flipped
but my apparatus is up to status
don't ask who's the baddest , of course that is
the maker , breaker , taker , my rhymes ache the head
put it to bed , so watch what is said
save the bass for the pipe and rearrange your tone
or take a loss and be forced in the danger zone
cos i get ill and kill at will
teachin a skill that's real , you're no frill
so just stand still and chill as i build
science i drill until my rhymes fill
your head up...don't even get up
the teacher is teachin' , so just shut up
rappers , take a step back , or you will soon regret that
you ever had to confront me and you can bet that
i come correct , perfect , in full effect
disconnect , dissect , eject as i wreck shop
stand in command with the clan
caravan or van , we go man for man and
without further ado or any delay
mister cee as we say , call him the dj
mad money murf with the triple m
smooth the barber keepin' my flat - top trim
scoob lover my brother , scrap lover my other
dancin' with the crew so allow the boys to smother
the floor , and endure just for your pleasure
as the microphone lord proceeds to get raw
acrobatic , asiatic , rap fanatic
i get dramatic and rhymes start flowin' automatically
from me , so don't play me , obey me
when asked " who's the best ? " , you better say me
i'm sendin' sucker mc's headin' north
and if you still want some...set if off
for you to cope is just a wish and a hope
and if you are what you eat they're feedin' me dope
cos i'm just about as dope as dope can get
ultimate , legit , kane is a perfect fit
the king of my kingdom , completin' a cipher
the lyrics i bring them keeps the crowd hyper
as i release the masterpiece
the groove will never cease until kane says " peace "
so , maestro , yo , hit it
big daddy kane's about to come with it , cause...
