come , get some , you little bum
i take the cake but you can't get a crumb
from the poetic , authentic , superior
ultimate , and all that good shit
i'm the original , asiatic , acrobatic
there you have it , now get dramatic
creatin' drama when i'm on the scene
and i pack 'em in mean , like bruce springsteen
i profile a style that's mild and meanwhile
put on trial , a rap pile to exile
make you tumble and stumble , in a rumble just crumble
and i'm still calm and humble
you need another helpin' hand to swing on
i stand alone , but still you gotta bring on
your batman and robin , cagney and lacey
starsky and hutch , but they still can't face me
and if may make this one thing here clear
that's for you not to come near , period
so i ain't buggin' or delirious
my swift tongue's like a sword , that's how severe it is
and i can slice and dice a fisher - price mc
that thought he was nice into minute rice
single - handed , i ain't with that band stuff
cause cee'll scratch a record like flakes of dandruff
and the mic i ravage , not like a savage
but in my own way of doin' damage
as i design the genuine line
now who flattop rules in eighty - nine ?
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
take two other men with soul that you probably know
deadly as scarface , but bright as the cosby show
don't attack rappers , but make everyone hush
they step to me , but can't stop the bum rush
i make material , rich and imperial
the unique technique i speak is all original
you like to sag and drag and gag
same old same old , but papa's got a brand new bag
so put the mic down boy , you can't work it
due to wack lyrics , it's bout to short circuit
so toss the sauce across to the boss , no remorse
you lost , with force , of course , a holocaust
first i caught ya , then put ya through torture
you moved wrong my son , so i taught ya
just like a guardian , that put your body in
the mood to groove with the smooth way that i'm partyin'
competition may find it spectacular
scheme and fiend to take a bite like dracula
and waste the taste , cause ain't no sugar here
so come near if you dare , you booger bear
you start hallucinatin' like magic
the wrath gets tragic , but kane won't have it
cause you tried to juice me when you're bluffin'
slowed the pace , so i had to start rushin'
so pick a b.c. date , cause you're history
here comes kane , scoob , scrap , jay , and mister cee
and this is one thing to us we ain't new to
the crew'll cast a spell on the crowd just like voodoo
i'm the man you can't hold back
and all competition appears to be weak
i meant to say wack , a vision of blur
just them thinkin' i'm competitin' , i say , " huh ! "
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
warm it up , kane , warm it up , kane
