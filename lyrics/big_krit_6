came in with all this money
i know that they all want it
but you're the one who gets it
should've paid more attention
i should be paying more attention to you ( x4 )
shit , smoke and mirrors , dollar bills
flexin' for no reason , get it how you live
crack a seal , bottle poppin' on another level
red light special , she ain't selfish , workin' with no discretion
twistin' , turnin' , my mind blown and her mind gone
she slow rollin' , ain't no ho in her time zone
face right , stage lights turn her out
act like she the only one in here
that can twerk for real and that's without a doubt
like damn , dj , run that back
i think that was her song and she don't know how to act
like damn , all night , i been with it
all night she been gettin' it , all night she been winnin'
i should be paying more attention to you
( more attention to you , i should be paying more attention to you )
all this money being thrown
all these lights shinin'
don't none of that shit outshine you
ya already know , let go
toot it up , turn ya out
show out when you show up
show out when you show up
show out when you show up
( came in with all this money )
and everybody know it , chain still glowin'
kick it with my folk that ain't been here before
thought i seen everything i can see on the low
wish i seen from the door that you the best of the best
make a broke motherfucker thumb through a check
i ain't really trippin' on ya homegirl , she was in her own world
shawty , i'm just hopin' you next to show up and show out
ya make it hard for me just to roll up and roll out
to be honest
you the type of chick a nigga search for when he have to go out
spotlight , night life , live in v.i. every weekend
i ain't trippin' on a busta that really ain't nothin'
i'm hopin' you down for the creepin'
like damn , super throwed , kill the pole
the whole club had to show you love the way you toot it up and get it off the floor
like damn , tell me you know you the greatest
ain't a chick in the v.i.p. that can shine like this , baby girl , you know you made it
i ain't trippin' on this shit i got right here
just tryna make it happen in the club , ya feel me ?
but you the baddest chick in this motherfucker
i was slippin' but i'm here now , what happening ?
let go , let go , let go , let go
