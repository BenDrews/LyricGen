i drink liquor on liquor
i had women on women , yeah ; that's bunk - bed bitches
i've done lived more than an 80 - year - old man still kickin'
‘cause they live for some moments , and i live for a livin'
but this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
on some ground ball shit
‘cause now i run my city on some town hall shit
they praying on my motherfucking downfall , bitch
like a drought , but
you gon' get this rain , like it's may weather
g.o.o.d. music , 'ye weather
champagne just tastes better
they told me i never , boy , never say never
swear flow special like an infant's first steps
i got paid , then reversed debts
then i finally found a girl that reverse stress
so now i'm talking to the reaper to reverse death
yep , so i can kick it with my granddad , take him for a ride
show him i made somethin' out myself and not just tried
show him the house i bought the fam , let him tour inside
no matter how far ahead i get , i always feel behind
in my mind , but fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
i said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
i grew up to em , b.i.g. , and pac , bitch , and got ruined
so until i got the same crib b.i.g. had in that juicy vid
bitch , i can't mothafuckin' stop movin'
go against me , you won't stop losin'
from the city where every month is may - day at home , spray your dome
niggas get sprayed up like a.k. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
yeah , i know that shit ain't fair
they say detroit ain't got a chance , we ain't even got a mayor
you write your name with a sharpie , i write mine in stone
i knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
we on , tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
rep detroit , everybody , detroit versus everybody
i'm so fucking first class , i could spit up on every pilot
the city's my metropolis , feel it , it's metabolic
and i'm over niggas saying they're the hottest niggas
then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
i'm one of the hottest , because i flame drop ; drop fire
and not because i'm namedroppin' , hall of fame droppin'
and i ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're ogs
‘cause that ain't the way of a og
so i g - o collect mo' gs , every dollar
never changed though , i'm just the new version of old me
forever hot - headed but never got cold feet
got up in the game , won't look back at my old seats
clique so deep we take up the whole street
i need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
sean don
miscellaneous minds are never explaining their minds
devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
peddling sin , thinking maybe when you get old you realize
i'm not gonna fold or demise
i don't smoke crack , mothafucka , i sell it !
bitch , everything i rap is a quarter piece to your melon
so if you have a relapse , just relax and pop in my disc
don't you pop me no fucking pill
i'ma pop you and give you this
tell flex to drop a bomb on this shit
so many bombs , ring the alarm , like vietnam on this shit
so many bombs , make farrakhan think that saddam in this bitch
one at a time , i line them up
and bomb on they mom while she watching the kids
i'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
i'm important like the pope , i'm a muslim on pork
i'm makaveli's offspring , i'm the king of new york
king of the coast ; one hand , i juggle them both
the juggernaut's all in your jugular , you take me for jokes
live in the basement , church pews , and funeral faces
cartier bracelets for my women friends , i'm in vegas
who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be ?
if phil jackson came back , still no coaching me
i'm uncoachable , i'm unsociable ; fuck y'all clubs !
fuck y'all pictures ! your instagram can gobble these nuts
gobble dick up 'til you hiccup , my big homie kurupt
this the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
( west , west , west , west , west , west )
i've seen niggas transform , like villain decepticons
mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' lindsay lohan
a bunch of rich ass white girls looking for parties
playing with barbies
wreck the porsche before you give them the car key
judgement to the monarchy , blessings to paul mccartney
you called me a black beatle , i'm either that or a marley
( i don't smoke crack ; motherfucker , i sell it ! )
i'm dressed in all black , this is not for the fan of elvis
i'm aiming straight for your pelvis , you can't stomach me
you plan on stumping me ?
bitch , i’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
bitch , i put one on yours , i'm sean connery
james bonding with none of you niggas
climbing 100 mil in front of me
and i'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
and if you're in it , better run for pete's sake
i heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'bout who's the best mc : kendrick , jigga , and nas
eminem , andré 3000 ; the rest of y'all
new niggas just new niggas , don't get involved
and i ain't rocking no more designer shit
white t’s and nike cortez , this red corvette's anonymous
i'm usually homeboys with the same niggas i'm rhyming with
but this is hip - hop
and them niggas should know what time it is
and that goes for jermaine cole , big k.r.i.t. , wale
pusha t , meek millz , a$ap rocky , drake
big sean , jay electron' , tyler , mac miller
i got love for you all , but i'm tryna murder you niggas
tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
they don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
what is competition ? i'm tryna raise the bar high
who tryna jump and get it ? you're better off tryna skydive
out the exit window of five g5's with five grand
with your granddad as the pilot , he drunk as fuck , tryna land
with the hand - full of arthritis and popping prosthetic leg
bumpin' pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
is an option of violence , someone heard the stewardess said
that your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
west coast
you could check my name on the books
i earth wind & fire’d the verse , then reigned on the hook
the legend of dorothy flowers proclaimed from the roof
the tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
of the wild magnolia , mother of many soldiers
we live by every single word she ever told us
watch over your shoulders , and keep a tin of beans for when the weather turns the coldest
the lord is our shepherd , so our cup runneth over
put your trust in the lord , but tether your chevy nova
i’m spittin' this shit for closure
and god is my witness , so you could get it from hova
to all you magicians that’s fidgeting with the cobra
i’m solid as a rock , ‘cause i came from a rock
that’s why i came with the rock
then signed my name on the roc
draw a line around some earth , then put my name on the plot
‘cause i endured a lot of pain for everythang that i got
the eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
and the tissue is like an angel kissing you in the dark
you go from blind sight to hindsight
passion of the christ , right , to basking in the limelight
it take time to get your mind right
jay electricity , pbs mysteries
in a lofty place , tangling with satan over history
you can’t say shit to me , الحمد لله‎
it’s strictly by faith that we made it this far
