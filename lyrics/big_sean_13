when you said it was over , you shot right through my heart
why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
ooh , i was so mad , i should've seen this coming right from the start
you should beware , beware , beware of a woman with a broken heart
praying to a sky all black
looking at the stars like they finna talk back
looking at my phone like she finna call back
but last night i feel like probably ended all that
cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
then another one tryna take it all back
saying fuck you , i miss you or i hate you so much
cause girls only say " hate you " to the guys that they love
i know , i know , i know
the highs , the lows it comes and goes
you say " be real " i try , i don't
cause you take anything and just make it everything
kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring ( funny , right ? )
and i never cheated ( i mean , maybe once , twice )
one time don't change everything
she ask why i don't feel the same , i'm still the same
she's still insane and now she's saying
when you said it was over , you shot right through my heart
why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
ooh , i was so mad , i should've seen this coming right from the start
you should beware , beware , beware of a woman with a broken heart
okay , skeet , smoke , sleep , call , miss , text , woke , spoke
lie , feel , lisa ew , time , kill , months , still
i got somebody baby mama calling me daddy

penthouse after party hoes want that addy
fuck they can ride with us , crawl in a caddy
third row is when you call , i hit cancel
really ? i hit answer , fuck i hate when that happens
phone in my pocket for the whole night
and you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
then she text me like " why you still talk to my mama ? "
how the fuck you run around with condoms ?
why you make me get this tattoo ?
man , fuck this tattoo you the reason i wasn't single in college
what ? all because i had you , nigga i dont even have you
how am i suppose to get past you ?
and she called the next guy spillin' some real shit
now they problems he got to deal with
when you said it was over , you shot right through my heart
why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
ooh , i was so mad , i should've seen this coming right from the start
you should beware , beware , beware of a woman with a broken heart
girl , don't believe them hoes
cause they don't wanna see us together
and you already know you're too fly
but baby , don't get your hair caught in the propellers
i be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
you know they never like it when you never say never
long hair , red bone , but her pussy is hairless
muah , i french kiss it like we in paris
i be screaming out , " ain't no woman like the one i got "
but she be always worrying about the one i fucked
she said it's gonna be me , myself and i
damn , that would make me a one eyed fuck
sch , i was so mad
damn , you used to ride a nigga like a moped
but players fuck up , my bad
and just to keep from crying , i laughed
when you said it was over , you shot right through my heart
why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
ooh , i was so mad , i should've seen this coming right from the start
you should beware , beware , beware of a woman with a broken heart
baby , last time calling me baby
