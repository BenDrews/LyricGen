do or die , nigga
i'mma keep poppin' this champagne
don't worry about shit
finally famous , nigga
man , i look up to god , i wonder if i fell from the sky
would i hit the ground or will i learn how to fly ?
i'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
sometimes i wonder if i already died
that shit get deep , deep , deep
man , i swear to god that shit just get so deep , deep , deep , deep
man , i swear to god it get so deep though
that sometimes i just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though
and wonder what if all the shit i reaped then got repoed
and the girl i gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
see , i got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll
got off in the game , don't need no cheat code
as long as i know the g code
being paranoid done turned me to a creep
you ain't got that metal on your side
police gon' work it like magneto if they need to , it get deep
deep , deeper than telekinesis
deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces
the deeper it gets , boy , the pressure increases
but pressure make diamonds
and my name is sean cause i shine , it's self explanatory
i architect the flow , rapping all of these stories on stories
you know the story
if my back against the ropes , then i'll finish stone cold it
my opponent probably praying for postponement
you fuck with the best rapper , don't even know it
it's written in the stars , man , the sky is the author
i pulled the sword out of the stone , i'm king arthur
motherfuck your armor , nigga , only weapon i'm scared of is karma
you watching the son turn to father , fucking life and her daughter
nigga , that shit just get deep
man , i look up to god , i wonder if i fell from the sky
would i hit the ground or will i learn how to fly ?
i'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
sometimes i wonder if i already died
that shit get deep , deep , deep
man , i swear to god that shit just get so deep , deep , deep , deep , deep
been going hard all day
wish a nigga would fuck with me
then i blow the candles out on my cake
and niggas always thinking it's a game
til we ran them out the arcade
stunting in my southernplayerlistic cadillac , andre
i talk that cash money shit
ym plus cmb , you can do the math for me , bitch
jail time , a slap on the wrist
cut your head off , get it mailed out , stamp on your lips
you can tell i'm grinding by my wrist
anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist
well , tell them i'll be waiting in suspense
i got some miles on me , but it's cool cause i never give an inch
and i don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
cause this shit is deeper than rap , i cannot say
that shit enough times like somebody rewind me
like shit is deeper than rap , i cannot say that shit enough times
i feel like sean , don't get enough shine
is it because he ain't got the tattoos ? he ain't throwing up signs
well , let me throw up mine
and also let me show this vision of mine
fuck the finish line , just finish your lines
and if getting your point across crosses the line
some of the time then cross it with pride
that's real , my nigga , remember that
and it ain't about if they remember you , they remember rap
so just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that
cause this shit is deep , deep
deep as empty pockets , nigga
we come empty pockets before we have empty pockets , slime
that shit get deep
man , i look up to god , i wonder if i fell from the sky
would i hit the ground or will i learn how to fly ?
i'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
sometimes i wonder if i already died
that shit get deep , deep , deep , deep
man , i swear to god that shit just get so deep , deep , deep , deep , deep
that shit get deep , deep , deep
( deep as empty pockets )
deep , deep
( we come empty pockets before we have empty pockets )
yeah , oh my god is just so deep , yeah , yeah
( deep as empty pockets )
( we come empty pockets before we have empty pockets )
sometimes i wonder if i already died
that shit get deep
