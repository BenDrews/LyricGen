yeah , you know a nigga
don't really wanna take his cool off , uh
( boi , do it ! ) i digress , it's
early in the morning when she’s all alone
i’mma take my time , do it how we want it
just to set the mood , girl
i brought some marvin gaye and chardonnay
hold up , hold up , hold up , hold up , hold up
hold up , hold up , hold up , hold up , hold up , yeah
she love the way i’m doing it ( she do it )
so g.o.o.d. she won't put my tattoo on it
bottom line is , you the finest
gave you a new name ( what's that , what's that ? ) my bitch
hold up , hold up , whoa there , let's capture this moment
if i hit it then i own it , marijuanin' every mornin
and patroning girl , we groaning
but that pussy got me feeling like a kid
with the street lights on , street lights on - on ?
you know i gotta go in 'til it’s
early in the morning when she’s all alone
i’mma take my time , do it how we want it
just to set the mood , girl
i bought some marvin gaye and chardonnay
so just let the song play ( and i'mma give it to ya )
the long way ( and give it to ya )
the strong way ( we at it all day )
it’s our day ( it's like this always )
it’s our way ( after a long day )
this was all inspired by a little marvin gaye and chardonnay
hold up , hold up , hold up , hold up
hold up , hold up , hold up
talk to the , talk to the , hand
bitch , you talking to a grown ass man
it’s like , way - way - way too much up in your pants
for us not to make the bed squeak
( there goes the bed sheets )
everybody rip the swag off 'fore i rip the tag off
why my pants sag off ? cause i’m rapping my ass off
flow so ugly , money so handsome
this the fucking anthem , get it ? the fucking anthem
early in the morning when she’s all alone
i’mma take my time , do it how we want it
just to set the mood , girl
i bought some marvin gaye and chardonnay
so just let the song play ( and i'mma give it to ya )
the long way ( and give it to ya )
the strong way ( we at it all day )
it’s our day ( it's like this always )
it’s our way ( after a long day )

i be saying , i , uh , i think
when i know , uh , just because..
i don’t really wanna , uh , talk too much shit
but you love it when i talk like i lost it
and i love how you look when you blazin’
and i swear you turn at least half asian
and we about to have a liaison
she so cool , give head with her shades on
you should just go and throw a cape on
and it’s just so amazing
( so amazing , so amazing )
take it to the car , bloop , bloop
that shit look like i’m speed racing
leavin' with me , it’ll boost your reputation
westside is where i’m stationed
spend all night , just champagne tasting
ain't no rush girl , let's just pace it 'til it's
early in the morning when she’s all alone
i’mma take my time , do it how we want it
just to set the mood , girl
i bought some marvin gaye and chardonnay
so just let the song play ( and i'mma give it to ya )
