i am ready right now
uh huh
i look up i don't even know no more
i think it's funny how it go down
i don't even know no more , official shit
i'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
everything around me gold like i just practiced alchemy
i realized when it comes to girls
that chemistry means way more than anatomy
she mad at me , she been mad at me
i'm the livin' proof
that you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece
people passin' faster than i'm passin' weed
my daddy tell me , " stay strong , son
and be the man you have to be
holdin' ship down , don't crash at sea "
brrrt ! paper on my phone line
it's on my phone like fax for me , that's facts to me
but i don't want it if it can't change shit drastically , dramatically
'cause actually , i realized time's the most valuable , actually
so i'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
and as for me , i'ma text the room number right now
so you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me
don't ask for me , don't ask for me
don't ask for me
lot of shit been goin' on , things goin' wrong
so don't ask for me
i'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
everything around me gold like i just practiced alchemy
i realized when it comes to girls
that chemistry means way more than anatomy
she mad at me , she been mad at me
she been mad , i've been on the go , on the road
on a roll more than a roller coaster
they can't throw me off track or slow
if i did , i got a long list of hoes on hoes
that quote on quote , say i told you so
heaven on earth , every night is paradise
i pray i didn't die or overdose , never that
i kept it a hundred , never change , not even for five 20s
still smokin' at 5 : 20 like it's 4 : 20
on a quest for more money , more hungry
just got my fortune read , she said it's more comin'
yeah i got the force but never force nothin'
do it for the love , i'm forrest gumpin'
in my city i'm warren buffett
i mean business , the shirt is tucked in
the gun's tungsten , fuck it , i'm who not to fuck with
who the bad bitches gon' fuck with and lames just don't fuck with
my stock's risin' , i'm goin' public , if i write it , it's gon' publish
you're fuckin' with the best , no discussion
so disgusting
it's that 3 and a third shit
straight up
i'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
everything around me gold like i just practiced alchemy
i realized when it comes to girls
that chemistry means way more than anatomy
she mad at me , she been mad at me
she been mad
