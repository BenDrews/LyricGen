uh , yeah , look
okay i know what it feel like to be young and single
you know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
you know taking double shots , saying fuck a single
you know , hardly getting sleep but it' the fuckin' dream though
look , i know what it feel like to think you found the one
told mom that so many times that i'm sounding dumb
cause she started to mix ashley up with tanesha
and saying " hi britney " when i'm on the phone with lisa
fuck it , i got some new hoes , i mean some xxx girls
pussy get wet as an s - curl
then i started thinkin' 'bout my ex - ex - ex girl
and how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
you know , good girl , bad time , right place , wrong mind
got my mind right , hit her back , brrr , the wrong line
( the number you dialed has been disconnected )
man , but before i started feeling bad
my nigga text me like " i got some hoes , hit me back " fuck it

can't even stunt i was sprung from the jump
never got head while flaming up the blunt
you were my first , i'm just saying
more folks should try it , it's crazy
focus , selfish moments , on road , i don't have my share
flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
sleepy arguments via texts while i buy my beer
and the air so tired i forget to recline my chair
picture you in my head , a souvenir by my legs
some scuba gear for the bed , we do it cause simon says
ain't a single living thing that likes living single
