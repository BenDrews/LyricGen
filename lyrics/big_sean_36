remember all the nights you used to fall through
wondering why you don't fall through
all the late late nights i used to call you
wondering why i don't call you
think it's déjà vu
cause i been here with you
i swear it's all déjà vu
cause we been here , and we done this

and hardly get to play ( i know )

it feel like we ain't even skip a day
whoa , it's been 3 years

where does the time go , you just had a baby
you had a new man , and you just separated
back on the scene and you already faded

the best sex is still you
remember all the nights you used to fall through
wondering why you don't fall through
all the late late nights i used to call you
wondering why i don't call you
think it's déjà vu
cause i been here with you
i swear it's all déjà vu
cause we been here , we done this
