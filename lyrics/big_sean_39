you win some and lose some , i heard that my whole life
i heard that my whole life , but that doesn't make it right
( okay , you got ahead tonight )
man , that doesn't make it right
man , that doesn't make it right
how do you sleep at night ?
sean , nigga you on , damn , nigga , you on
you was a millionaire but your niggas is still at home
damn , nigga , you did it , but damn it you did it wrong
you got time for that gig , but not time for the phone
got it right with your ends , but fucked it up with your friends
i seen your ass up on tv , touched up on them twins
you don't know about hard times , you clutched up in that benz
get tired of fuckin' hoes then get to fuckin' their friends , whoa
niggas want handouts , and i only got two
now i'm on the phone talkin' to my mom like i only got you
gettin' dressed up for court , that's a law suit
ain't wearin' v necks , but niggas ask what happened to the crew
now i'm in court for some shit i didn't do
cause of my nigga , knowin' my career could've been through
so when it's time to travel management say i only need two
listenin' to them when i'm the one that makes the rules
i'm just a victim of the life though that i ain't tryna lose
this the dream , i had a wake up call and missed snooze
lately though my family been too happy
i just turned my mama hooptie to a new caddy
people thinkin' i'm rich and i wish they knew that
i been signed for four years and i'm just able to do that
worry 'bout my next rolex time piece
my nigga tone worry 'bout our sis , shanice
we supposed to be the role models
no wonder why she wanna smoke weed and skip college
is this the example i'm tryna set ?
are these the people i'mma forget ?
are these the times i'mma regret ?
livin' life wishin' i could hit reset but , but
you win some and lose some , i heard that my whole life
i heard that my whole life , but that doesn't make it right
( okay , you got ahead tonight )
man , that doesn't make it right
man , that doesn't make it right
how do you sleep at night ?
okay , you win some , lose some , break some , bruise some
life could be a test , multiple choice , choose some
choose one , stick with it , man , prove some
sometimes the best teachers is ourselves goin' through somethin'
real life will teach your ass way fucking fast
i always thought my last girl was supposed to be my last
i got four aunties , two uncles , one dad
one mom , two brothers , and 200 niggas mad
and it's only one me , divide it and do the math
i'm the one that dropped out , got no time for the class
how am i supposed to have time for everyone i just said ?
i don't even have time for everything in my head
on my way to see kim and ye both tie the knot
wishin' me and you were no strings attached , but were nots
man thats drama , drama drama
so deep that call each others mamas' mamas
we need a break i mean comma , comma comma
i'm tryin , homie
but she always picks the wrong time like phones dyin' on me
in the bed cryin' on me , talkin' lyin' on me
it sucks to hit the internet and see you're lyin' on me
fuck
is this the example i'm tryna set ?
are these the people i'mma forget ?
are these the times i'mma regret ?
livin' life wishin' i could hit reset but , but
you win some and lose some , i heard that my whole life
i heard that my whole life , but that doesn't make it right
( okay , you got ahead tonight )
man , that doesn't make it right
man , that doesn't make it right
how do you sleep at night ?
see , the mind is a fucking trickster
it can fuck you 'round , but your heart will never lie to you
and that’s why people love you , sean
because you talk to them from the heart
( thanks , dad )
that’s why you're magical , sean
it’s no mistake that you’re where you are right now
you speaking that from your brain , but they hear you from your heart
because people can see your bullshit
and i know i’m talking a lot of shit
( no , you’re not )
but i want you to hear that
because i’m a great motherfucker , man
and i’m very modest
you know , i am
and i know a lot of shit
they know when you bullshit
they don’t even intellectualize it
they feel it
life is a feeling process
