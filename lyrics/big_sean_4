clique star - studded like the paramount mountain
everything i do is righteous
betting on me is the right risk
even in a fucking crisis

if you fuck with my glory , i'ma drop the l and get gory
i done did everything except worry
hella drama , my life story
faith of a mustard seed , i kept growing
i knew that this life was meant for me

karma come around i'll wish 'em well
livin' like i’m on a limitless pill
i kill the scene like i’m denzel
crazy like my jacket strapped up
nigga , i don’t act but i'll act up
brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
back , back , back , back up
nigga , i'ma need like 10 feet
or get stomped out with ten feet
i'ma always lose my temper

if i lose 1 , i bounce back like 2 , 3 did with 4 , 5
seen court rooms and court sides , ain’t too many seen both sides
nigga , fuck what you know
nigga , i’m takin' back control
the underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
yeah , i call shots while you call off
never takin' summer or fall off
when you stay that committed to it , you just fall down and never fall off , so
