they used to tell me , used to tell me
i hope you learn to make it on your own
and if you love yourself , just know you'll never be alone
i hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
i hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
million dollar cribs , havin' million dollar dreams
and when you get it all , just remember one thing
remember one thing , that one man could change the world
that one man could change the world
all i , all i wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
imagined this so much , some nights it felt like that i had it
back on the mattress , starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
but it's hard makin' those attachments
i'm talkin' dreamin' so hard , some nights it felt like draft day
you know ? my - my step brother used to flip them bags
outside the crib like it was trash day
no kim k , but he bagged yay ( ye )
but when you're gettin' fast money , slow down , don't crash
with all the drive in the world , swear you still need gas
look , think about it , close your eyes , dream about it
tell your team about it , go make million dollar schemes about it
success is on the way , i feel it in the distance
used to look up at the stars
and be like , " ain't too much that's different "
i be shinin' , they be shinin' , get your one shot , don't you miss it
what you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission ?
and i hope you learn to make it on your own
and if you love yourself , just know you'll never be alone
i hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
i hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
hope you get the pretty girls , that's pretty and everything
million dollar cribs , havin' million dollar dreams
and when you get it all , just remember one thing
remember one thing , one man could change the world
one man could change the world
my grandma told me , " if you write your name in stone
you'll never get the white out "
i grinded out that black hole then performed up at the white house
standin' next to jim carrey , we traded stories , then laughed
i said you not the only one i know got rich wearin' masks
where i'm from , i swear they broke
they need way more than the cast
we need more than what you have
and then we need more than that
but how am i supposed to say i'm tired
if that girl from west virginia came up in conditions
that i couldn't survive ?
went to war , came back alive
on top of that became a female black captain
when being black , you had to extra - extra try
way before james brown made us proud
she bought a crib on the same street as marvin gaye
right there on outer drive , and she taught me how to drive
and she raised the kids , then the kids' kids , and she did it right
taught me how to love , taught me not to cry
when i die , i hope you teach me how to fly
all my life you've been that angel in disguise , sayin'...
i hope you learn to make it on your own
and if you love yourself , just know you'll never be alone
i hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
i hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
hope you get the pretty girls , that's pretty and everything
million dollar cribs , havin' million dollar dreams
and when you get it all , just remember one thing
remember one thing , that one man can change the world
that one man can change the world
thank you for callin' me , been thinkin' about you
it's all good , i love you grandma
bye
