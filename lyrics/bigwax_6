with the clique , just another day
drink in my cup and i'm feeling okay
just killed a 30 - pack , got another on the way
got the homie's chevrolet full of tecate
la to tj , we do this all day
getting paid for the stupid ass shit that we say
we the illest motherfuckers while your crew is some marks
big wax , herbal t , bitch we lewis and clark
you heard the rumor probably that i sold my human body
to the illuminati and now they use it to copy
my brainwave patterns
i'm a master of a stupid hobby called rapping
i'll prove it probably when i'm right about at susan boyle's age
i'll have my first hit when the world's in a no - longer - using - oil stage
the soundtrack of apocalypse , looking back from the rocket ship
thinking i might have gotten rich in the nick of time
intense imagination , we in places your basic complacent mind can't relate with
outside the matrix , outline my face with chalk
we're already dead , where ya'll steadily tread
you walk , on the path of a mortal
while me and herbal t we are practically orbital
trash your recordable device and all its contents
nobody feeling that nonsense
i got the feeling that columbus must have felt when he reached the shore
vasco de gama rhymer , i'm a conquistador
venturing to territory no one's ever seen before
rap el dorado , let the bottle of tequila pour
legendary lena horne status for my clique
y'all more like the katrina storm , tragic as shit
been doing this since the doc pulled us out by cesarean birth
it won't stop 'til i'm buried in earth
i'm saying , the flow's so nice it's got great karma
loa chop the beat like a steak shwarma
great like parma -
- sean cheese on your marinara spaghetti
repping maryland steady
people preparing confetti , girls raring and ready
comparing to betty grable or marilyn wearing a teddy
we up in the serengeti with a pair of machetes
up in the bush with the kush , motherfuckers ain't ready
we ain't new to this new to this
we been doing this doing this
since the uterus
people been asking " who is this , who is this ? "
it's the crew with the fluidness
under numerous influences
getting loot off the fusion of music producing is stupidness
a human as ludicrous as the group of the two of us
is elusive as tuna fish in a pool that is fluid - less
or a brain tumor that's humorous
or a stewardess who had just flew in from cuba using a route that was two minutes -
please...
( please prepare for takeoff ! )
