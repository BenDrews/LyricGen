never... again
never go again
never , never again , again
never , never again
i ain't slept good in a very long time
never played a trick again , gotta get mine
preacher , preacher , money... can't see it
gotta go out there and get it
money over love
you know how much you love the finer things
money over love
fast cars , diamond rings
money over love
the best things in life ain't free
money over love
exchange your time for nickels and dimes
the world don't make no sense
if ladies don't need what i got
i'm just a late night fix
cost too much to settle down
i'd rather be alone
chasin' the life of a rich man
has to get my own
money over love
you know how much you love the finer things
money over love
fast cars , diamond rings
money over love
the best things in life ain't free
money over love
never , never again
never
shucking and jiving , wastin' my time
and i say never ( never ) again , we'll never be friends
you can bet your bottom dollar , bet you'll never mistreat my kindness
i say ( never ) , you can pretend
and while i defend every comma that's on this corner
you wanna sleep in designer , don't yah ? ( never )
i comprehend and then i resent
the potential bein' together forever , that's what you promised for me ( never )
fuck mr. cupid , put that vagina on me
i don't wanna love ( love )
until i can afford to love ( love )
i rock that box of credit
automatic
money over love
you know how much you love the finer things
money over love
fast cars , diamond rings
money over love
the best things in life ain't free
money over love
