broken hopes , no more goals
givin' up , cause i know
i'm so far from where i wanna be
i'm just tired of being alone
working hard on my own
only to fall on my knees
but what should i do ?
i've run out of moves
chasing this life i have dreamed
i can feel i'm out of breath
in this ocean of regret
close my eyes and i count it out
like , one - two - three
cause i'm drowning away
drowning away
save me , someone save me
i'm drowning away
drowning away
save me , someone save me
i look at all the things i could've done
since i turned twenty - one
that was when i last felt free
cause every door that i've knocked
won't open cause it's locked
things work out for everyone but me
but what should i do ?
i've run out of moves
chasing this life i have dreamed
i can feel i'm out of breath
in this ocean of regret
close my eyes and i count it out
like , one - two - three
cause i'm drowning away
drowning away
save me , someone save me
i'm drowning away
drowning away
save me , someone save me
i'm drowning away , drowning away
i'm drowning away , drowning away
i'm drowning away , drowning away
save me , someone save me
i'm drowning away , drowning away
save me , someone save me
i'm drowning away , drowning away
i'm drowning away , drowning away
i'm drowning away , drowning away...
save me , someone save me
