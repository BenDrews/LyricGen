it's all in her eyes , you and me , words just disguise
all the things that you be
what is deep , it's deeper than sea
so only it knows , this kind of vibe gets stronger in time
won't go on unnoticed , so concrete can't hold this
hearts filled righteously
whatever it is , i know that it's real
long as you know , no complaints , you're all that i feel
( sista soul )
you must be my soul sista , soul sista
( sista soul )
hey sis , you must be my soul sista , soul sista
( sista soul )
hey sis , you must be my soul sista
( sista soul )
you are so fine , like spaces that fall in my soul
see baby that has no rhyme
do you like how it feels when i smoke you out head down to your toes ?
making you , making you scream and shout
you must be my soul sista , soul sista , you're my
( sista soul )
you must be my soul sista , soul sista , you're my
( sista soul )
you must be my soul sista , soul sista , you're my
( sista soul )
you must be my soul sista , soul sista
( sista soul )
( sista soul )
you must be my soul sista , soul sista , sista , sista , sista soul
( sista soul )
sista soul , sista soul , sista soul
