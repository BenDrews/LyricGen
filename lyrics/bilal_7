this is a song that makes me
spill out all my guts , sometimes
sometimes , i wish i wasn't me
sometimes , i wish i was drug free
sometimes , wish i saw the exit sign first
sometimes , wish i knew the truth without search
sometimes , i wish i could go where i never been
see what i never saw , do what i never did
or walk before i could crawl
sometimes , i wish my eyes wasn't so red
sometimes , i wish i had breakfast in bed
sometimes , i mean it's worth it
since i did all the work last night
sometimes , you ain't good to me , yes
i am good to you and you don't see my attention
the way that i do
sometimes , hey slim , you should be nicer than you are
sometimes , you take that complaining shit way too far
i mean , i thought it was cute in the beginning but now
i think you only do it 'cuz you know i hate it
sometimes , you got me wishing i didn't have home training
sometimes , then it wouldn't hurt me so bad
with dreams of knocking you in your head
then it wouldn't hurt me so bad , with our kitchen knife deep in your ass
sometimes , wish i knew life with no pain , yeah
wish i held the keys to this game
sometimes , i pretend 'cuz i'm afraid to be , 'friad to be
sometimes , i hope i live to see twenty five
sometimes , i wish i could be like moses
round up my people , move out the ghetto and live a better life
sometimes , i wish i didn't try so hard
sometimes , who knows truth any way
they don't know nothing , who needs that approval
the sun in your hands player
move at your own pace , listen to your own mind
do your own thing , yeah , yeah
i'm saying it because i love ya
and i wanna grow with you , yeah , yeah
but you wanna run in the other direction
so i got to stay on my path until i win , i win , i win , i win
i wanna win , i wanna win , i wanna win , i wanna win
sometimes , sing it with me i wish
i wish in love and i wish , oh i wish
i wish in peace , oh sometimes
i wish in hope , i wish hope
i wish true , i wish true
i wish clearly , hey i wish so clearly sometimes
wish with no fear , i wish with no fear
i have no fear , i have no fear
have no doubt i have no doubt
i don't doubt i don't doubt
have no doubt no , i don't doubt
have no doubt , i wish love
i wish love , hey , hey
oh some , sometimes
sometimes , sometimes
