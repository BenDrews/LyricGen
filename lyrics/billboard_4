the streets playing dirty , get killed boy
this shit is for real boy , did all that shit with no deal boy
niggas is fakin' , they gettin' monopoly money

now i got twenty whole k on my wrist
diamonds , my neck , on my fist

thugger he gave me a shot now i'm in
so tired of losing can't do nun but win
every day wake up , i gotta get in
pray to the lord and i stay on my ten
free my niggas locked in the pen
we sip the lean and pour out the seal
you niggas so fake , you don't know nothin' bout real
labels keep calling , they want me to sign
talk to my voicemail , i don't recognize
came from the streets , i was sellin' them pies

and no i ain't just getting started boy , i been in the field
stacking hundred dollar bills
ridin' with some young niggas that know how to kill
lil bitch saying that she won't
let her hit the kk once , now she will
ya'll remind me of jack and jill
ya'll was up , now you going down the hill
i don't ever put my weed up in a blunt
don't act like you don't know no better
and don't ever ask me to borrow no dope
then act like you don't owe no cheddar
and shorty keep blowin' up both of my phones

just spoke to my bro who's in the hospital
i really do hope he get better

gorilla without wearing bathing ape
gold on my neck like it's eighty - eight
smokin' skittles , bunch of painkillers
think about quitting like day to day
i love new york , this ain't flava flav

dolce gabanna , the pants suede
i keep a drum like a band playin'
how you hatin' if your man made it ?
presidential rollie , bitch i'm campaignin'
i'm in the field like the special teams
sellin' records now , i was sellin' green
that bitch ain't know i was gon' sell a dream
before she woke up i took everything
i done did some niggas dirty
trafficking sour and fergie
i prayed to god for a birdie
i would kill for it , now it's billboards
all of her bottoms is bloody
these niggas act like they love me
i'd rather codeine than bubbly
but i had to chill , that shit fucked up my stomach
i made it
