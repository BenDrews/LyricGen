thinking of some things i can do to you shawty right now
i know you got a man , but he ain't gotta know what's going down
and we've been talking tough and now it's time to seal the deal
you're so real
let you know how i play girl , how i play is so trill
i'm going through things
said i'm going through things
going places that i've never been
shit will never be the same , never be the same
my name on the billboard , my name on the billboard
he had you but he misused it , telling you bullshit
but with me at least you feel important
i just wanna ride , i just wanna ride
i just wanna keep it real , baby you got it all
shawty let's go - go - go - go - go
let's hit the road
don't wanna see his ass no more
ain't stressing bout a thing
baby you ain't got no reason i'm telling you it's all good
baby listen now , i'ma hold you down
i'm telling you it's all good
he don't treat you right
i don't think he know your worth
promise you i will always put you first , first
baby i just wanna
oh - oh , yeah
