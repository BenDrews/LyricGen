it's like , beyond physical attraction
your explosive personality blows my mentality
actually my emotions on a rampage
we ain't the same age but we in the same book , on the same page
the conversation calls for meditation
never amateur check the calendar let's make a reservation
communication is the bridge at times
i wonder what your thinking
the truth will set you free like abe lincoln
free i'm totally emancipated proclaiming
is due to the love together we've created
our thoughts no longer seperated
past barriers past road blocks you've opened
my heart no need to pick the lock
the key to my heart should be the sole controller
life is full of ups and downs like a roller coaster
im hip to your vibe like motorola
as long as your a soldier im hanging in your world like a poster
supernova baby you shine extraterrestrial
sometimes you throw me off like jonah on a water vessel
but what we got is crazy real
deep like a navy seal
plus i like the way you make me feel baby chill
you know the deal you playing with a full deck
trump tight no jokes ace's high in full affect
your affecting me and it's crazy cause love is a gamble
always had an ace up my sleeve incase my maid wanted to leave
but now i ease dizzy from to much exhaling
but not suffocating cause your my ...
the breath of life , what is a man without a wife ?
that's absurd like a butcher without a knife
i slice through your thoughts with words that cut you sharp
your torch keep me burning my world no longer dark
i spark with the best but you no contest
conquest on your love my mission accomplished
i feed you the knowledge your system digests
you feed me the knowledge my system digests
we make love in excess
we progress through thick and thin x - ray vision like superman
i see through the bullshit
that's why i like your style
able to leap tall buildings in a single bound
eventually if it was meant to be
then it would be cause we related physically and mentally
physically and mentally we related
now i'm elated what was once meant to be is our reality
and i'm loving every moment of our ecstasy
not too many people get a chance to see
a connection between two people based not on sexuality
but something real
that's how you make me feel
we formed a bond and i could go on forever
telling the world how together we're two of a kind
body soul and mind
what's mine is yours what's your is mine
throughout the course of time
we stay on point like a porcupine
anytime everything move faster
every king need a queen so you could be my cleopatra
and i could be your shaka zulu
i sock it to you i know you got the point
baby doll i got the voodoo
i want you for the rest of my life
and time is starting your love makes me
weak in the knees like tonya harding
you stole my heart and that's a felony
prison is the penalty confined in my mind in brain cell block 3
i locked you in my heart and threw away the key
there's no escape i guard it like a maximum security
secure is how i feel
knowing that your soul not just your physical is here with me
and i thank the all mighty for the day that you invited me
to share your life
and book me i stole your heart yes i'm guilty so punish me
because your maximum security reassures me
you'll never leave my side your spiritual vibe
no doubt
i'll be there like the jackson 5 satisfaction's
why i step to you with my plan like a mastermind
we pass the time as we dine you sip a glass of wine
i looked you in your eyes
and i case a line , now that ass is mine
you was amazed by the way that i attacked
now your white flag is raised high blowing in the gray sky
surrender your goods completely understood
unlike them other chicks wishing they shoulda coulda would
i told you once before baby i hit you
with these them other cats don't stand
a chance like christopher reeves
that's how it goes
you're not the type to wear provacative clothes
beautiful from your head to your popsicle toes
good looking what you got cooking
17 ways word to michael franks
give it to me raw with the mallionaise
i take it downtown baby calm down making all the sounds
like a figure 8 it's perfect all around
eventually if it was meant to be
then it would be cause we related physically and mentally
