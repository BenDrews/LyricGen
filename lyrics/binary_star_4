the two - headed dragon breathes fire , blows flames
veins pumping octane blazing pain , same brain
same ankle that enabled kain to slew , that's a sharp blade
whether you're willing or able i see your stockade
i'm from an age where the eye displays caption
it's passin' the fact that what you're really tongue lashin'
yo , and we strikin' they backs like they car , quick to dashin'
can't escape slavery , boy , i'm still the master
of natural disaster ; this rap tongue - twister
emerging from waterworld , the mighty whirlwind
microphone cyclone blowing in your ears , like your girlfriend
until the worlds end all these minds putting work in
employ these toys on a job and we'll see
but what the hell was they thinkin' ?
must've been drunk , what the hell was they drinkin' ?
wild irish rose , drunk as hell in a lincoln
head - on collisions in these rap competitions
my crew cats' record turn their frames into scrap metal
( off to the junkyard )
â€˜cause ain't nobody's on my rap level , you can ask the devil
it ain't no way in hell these contenders can hinder
remember : guard your fender from a friender
mr. senim silla , sinister swindler , i brought you stigmas
when your hides cross a land of temper
this is a warning to you men
we're joining these tournaments of journalists
and live by the pen , now die by the sword
tears through your gourd , gouge you through the mic cord
this fine bladed expores , watch as fine wine is poured
now toast to this
as we pour a little out for those who be approaching this
be approaching this , be approaching this , be approaching this
be approaching this , be approaching this , be approaching this
battle vocalist , the one man army in a war against iblis
lack of knowledge means i'm weaponless
don't just step to this
i sent pharoah messages , like moses
taking my people on an exodus
we on the run , i split the m - i - c open
kids try to follow , but get swallowed in the ocean
preacher of the truth , non - believers making mockery
it ain't no stopping me , i fulfill all prophecy
similar to david with the rock
i sling shots at your bestest warrior
plus i'm ill with the poetry
you know it's me , but you still couldn't catch us
maneuver on the mic or lose heads , like john the baptist
when i rap this , wack mc's feel the rapture
others fugitive style your brains couldn't capture
ever since the beginning of time , let there be light
that's the first day , i wrote my first rhyme
i'm still writing , i seen you looking at 'em
but don't even think about biting
forbidden poetry is a life , dig these
your ass couldn't hide from me with fig leaves
we move fast , like quickdraw mcgraw
when it's time we get raw
our crew come together , like jigsaw puzzles
we moving on the double ; a t - r - o - u - b - l - e , we spell trouble
for you cats and dogs without muzzles
barking in my face , that'll carry no weight , like space shuttles
we rock the mic , like rubble
binary star came to reign ; drip , drop , rain puddles
subtle , anonymous , rap hippopotamus
milk homogeneous , deeper than a pit that's bottomless
the knowledge is : to see us , you must be an astrologist
stars , quasars , sirius , synonomous
