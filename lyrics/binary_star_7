hey you sayin , what the hell is this shit ?
reaching for the cover , turning up your deck
who's blowing your cassette ? color me for suspect
terror's what i am , terrorisms what i rep
rap hezbollah we don't forgive or forget
strapped with dynamite , kamikaze rock the mic
suicide , stage dive , it's gonna be a live night
now just to be accurate , label me immaculate
short fused like montagues feud capulets
elaborate labyrinth , lavish pen patterning
rick rude the ravashing , cabbage scavenging
from word babbling , babbling brook get words travelling
like mouths tattling , i'm kind of partial to battling
haven't you herd , you got beef i rustle cattle then
hit the sunset saddling , rap bronco
riding over tracks , lone ranger and tonto
compoze on the console , making it feel better
sunny to ill weather , i'm a all - season pro
all - terrain flow , shift five gears with four - by - four
on the go in the fast lane without reverse , i can't slow
no brakes , push the pedal to the metal
the formula one devil
heating up the treble , i rock like prudential
most cats is just pebbles , when you want it live you can't
compromise or settle , check my water level
my reservoir pours great lakes fifty states
and across seashores , the word spreads like pollen from spores
like wisdom from folklores , my fans from tours
now those are just metaphors
for how i distribute to you and yours
opening doors
we bum rush like a drug bust
nickel and dime , to all is mine alumnus , illustrious , wondrous
ominous in my prime , call me optimus senim
transforming slang autofire maximize
complete fumigation better jet for ventilation
before you suffer from senim inhalation
air deprivation
playing me for jolly , that's a dead man's folly
or crippled probably
on the good ship , get popped for acting lolly
by the son of bobby rowe how you like me now , like pulling a shotty
pistol whip your head knotty 'fore your boys lobby
you'll be carted on a dolly
senim synthesizer , kill with a sling blade
some call it a kaiser
equalizer blows your brains , expose your wiser
now which bastard wants some acid
corrosive chemicals casted
spitting venom i mastered
ran with dogs that's rabid , rivers that's rapid
rapping fire thru your attire
do you desire to be caught in cross - fire
loaded gun - for - hire , blazing saddle esquire
michigan , michelin , my dogs will never tire
