check me out now. check me out now
go head then
allow me to introduce myself again
bob's out the office but bobby ray is in
please leave a message wait , let me get a pen
i don't really need it cause i spit it off the lid
and every time i come around i look like i'm a pimp
really that's the dip because the ? is on my hip
they love me cause i tell 'em what they really wanna hear
slap her on that booty with a hundred dollar bill
what ! ?
nah i'm just playin' man sometimes i kid
just so that my job doesn't get monotonous
crumble up the bud , put it in a spliff
put it in the air like i'm levitating shit
they say , " bob how you feel about the fame ? "
really ain't famous till obama know my name
the game's in a drought
it was going down the drain
when i come around man its prolly gon' rain ( so what's you sayin' ? )
maybe i'm just sayin' i can switch up the flow
how you can't feel me when i'm rocking this show ?
going over seas to a whole 'nother coast
come back get a sack full of that like whoa
yeah i can take you way back like +whoa+
so listen two me rap sit back like whoa
and every time i rip they be like , " that's dope "

hell naw , we ain't done
( let's do it )
need to get round two in
oh oh oh
well the biz , the biz i'm in the music biz
i really couldn't tell you what the main objective is
cause really that depends
on if you got a hit or just a good song that they never ever spin
and then that depends on the genre that you in
if you're a rock artist or a hip hop blend
that's where i come in
they try to box me in
but i am not a square nor a parallelogram
yes i got several fans through japan to maryland
they try to shoot me down but i never ever land
and no man could never ever walk in my pants
or live what i've lived
or be what i am
damn
i don't give a damn
all up in this booth try to lay this shit down
yeah , so let me turn it down
we all around it ; s a mixtape now
