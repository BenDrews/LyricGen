5 am in this muthafucka , we still sippin
spending cheese on the women , nigga that's big pimpin
forever faded , i know lucifer waiting
brought this shit to fruition , took my niggas to vegas
who's better ? them never , lo sweaters

this boa know they loving the crew
she just wanted the last , thought i wanted it too
real niggas never hate another man
you see em gettin it then you get it , pardon my hand
but you forcin it and it's unfortunate
they won't be reaping the benefits of new porches is
folarin said we 6 million and running
so i'm just making sure my verses count for something
62 dreams , roll a date with some lean
it's 5 in the morn , yea i'm on the scene
5 am in this muthafucka we still sippin
sin city , my god , we still tippin
get these niggas the blues until they all crippin
this for my niggas hustlin until they last minute
my niggas buying time : rolexes
if xxl frontin on me i do it four x
i stared death in the eyes a couple times
my passport got stamped before a couple rhymes
laugh in a hater's face , tell him that he a broke nigga
the devil is alive , but what's it to a cold nigga ?
i know i know , i do not mean to boast
it's looking easy my nigga , a rap finger roll !
road to riches : who riding shotgun ?
who knows my worth and gonna take the charge when the cops come ?
righteously living , i know all my verses be cold
i be asking myself : am i selling my soul ? huh ?
born thuggin' , heartless and mean - muggin
you bulemic , struggling niggas ain’t eating supper
forever well - off
no kenny smith , no i'mma jet off
with rhyming skills , you in amish village
how simple they are
we are thee lyrical cpr , some decent broads
see gods eating philippe chow
we be like chow

we be like wow
they be like damn
we be like go
they be like where
we be like.. down
fellatio is frequent , still i treat them decent
jamaican for the weekend , rice , peas and king fish
in hindsight , i think alot of yall should try to see this
from college cheatin' , to bodyin' all these coliseum
you oughta see this , my modded sneaker is often three much
til the hype deceased i'll likely put all of my three’s up
bumpin' little brother feelin every word to love it
this warren moon meets warren buffet i throw up numbers
double m self made we forever rich
uptown , moco , prince george , represent
hit up mo hit up vic , an we rollin a swish
lexus with me for the night pick up hoes with my bitch
nigga flow like a missisipi river in a pitcher
that mean im overflowin all you rappin niggas in cups
this shit pay my momma bills , stackin my shit for real , she say you in my belly
i tell her i'm too sincere , that's a nas reference , lyrically ain't not impressive
if i hear another model - bottle rhyme , im flippin
my mind is like a lotto ticket yall dont get it
like a monica skinded with a madonna spirit
material girls i got a fetish for , so i got the best rapport
with business hoes an college strippers
d.c thats drugs come in dumb choppas
with no garden i know hoes that pump water
