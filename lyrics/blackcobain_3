i say oh you a pretty girl , you must be a aka
you got a man , well i guess i gotta pay to play
it's the ( ? ? ? ) , this a mutual feeling
i'm tryna eat ya pastries , angela simmons
is this love that i'm feeling , well i must be a marley then
hope you ride stick , you can play atari then
lol i just wanna rock a pretty girl
couple shots couple swirls , i need you in my world
i know about ya pump game like a macchiato
knock ya walls down , am i tryna remodel
a nigga drinking good like there's a message in a bottle
i like to gas em up , so i ask her if she a model ( yeah )
naomi c , mean ( ? ? ? ) game
bet the pussy on the bar , dice game
levitate ya confidence , baby you a 10 to me
you can keep ya heart , shit i don't want you into me
my preference is a red bone , i ain't being picky though
i would take a couple dondrias and some kelly rowl's
she treat me like 'ye if they amber rose
my pretty girls rock , i don't know them hoes
we can get lost in the poconos
and drop the top in the winter , have ya boobs exposed
i'm playing , unless you wanna do it
they just make a way , i just keep it enthusing
