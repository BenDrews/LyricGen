oh believe me , you'll understand. the music's very powerful
people's reactions to opera the first time they see it is very dramatic
they either love it or they hate it
if they love it , they will always love it
if they don't , they may learn to appreciate it
but it will never become part of their soul
if you take the time to listen , my pens need physicians
my heart touch the soul of the hustlers in the kitchen
my right tears the ideas for past years
i'm illmatic at present time i'm nasir
better than my roots , youngin' these are blacks' thoughts
black thought influenced in my music
i bring the flow straight to your neck , i'm a nuisance you can keep your two cents
cameras flashing , attendance of the mob
board administration the gang , no mirage
close your eyes and picture the pain , this a collage
kill these niggas with my music , introduce em to god
understand behind my bars i'm a felon , but you could never get in my correction
alleviate the pen and get the same direction
the hardest nigga out , so pardon my erection ( yea )
niggas spit crack , better act like y'all know
got the crew with em , them niggas is ice cold
everywhere they at they them niggas and y'all know
board administration
they ain't even talking unless it's 'bout dough
sippin' cold drinks and leaving with y'all hoes
fly purple label , act like y'all know
board administration
i spit truer than polygraphs , hope you get the gist of it
take you down memory lane with no permission slip
words from a whisper
you better off going where you started cus we answer all the questions like a sixer
tryna chase fame , be prepared for 12 steps
it's an addiction that i can't stress
being crucified for music as they cast away stones
fuck em the maricons as he puts the city on
closed minded , spilling out my heart i'm emotional
talking to my niggas , he like young i see the growth in you
as the clubs get played we bring the cash out
before the last call we already smashed out
a deaf man can feel this
knocking on the door of success nigga listen
got rid of the cancer , now we in remission
it's all playing out my intuition ( yea )
