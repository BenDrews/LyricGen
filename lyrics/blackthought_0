don't even ask how the high feel
ask how do i feel , probably how the sky feel
jokers is coming in sideways like a sidefill
the grapes of wrath intertwined like a vine still
physically i'm ill , walking through a minefield
with a straw sticking out a molotov cocktail
twenty one grams of soul on a rock scale
probably burn like flaming coals on a hot grill
yo , if the afterlife is absolutely not real
then you diminish and you're finished , it's a done deal
beyond that , my heartbeat is like a drum still
it's like i'm living on the run with the gun still
well , bring the hero back , he's taking care of that
cause his words get at the ginsbergs and kerouacs
it's all stuck inside your head like it's ear wax
whole scene something out of hollywood , miramax
hush , yo , don't nobody say a flocking word
just put the sign on the door , the do not disturb
i'm bout to show these people how to kill a mockingbird
you hit his whole network , like mark zuckerberg
your witnesses confirm that gunshots occurred
apparently the triggerman smokes lots of herb
and he could bring your demise disguised as a word
but guarantee that be the last one you ever heard
you deaf , dumb , and blind
i'm emphasized like i'm underlined
my definition is , i'm undefined
cause i'm one of a kind , at the top of the line
at the top of the food chain when it come to the rhyme
and i'm cynical cause i'm at the pinnacle
jokers is ridiculous , they the ones i ridicule
if somebody acting like they want it , i'mma get at dude
have 'em in the middle of the drama like an interlude
yeah , they weigh a buck ten , soaking wet , fuck them
yo , i don't need new friends , i can't trust them
you best keep a weapon like a shirt tail , tucked in
because i'm taking niggas out like huck finn
this news just in : mass destruction , boy
presented to you by black inc. productions
yeah , righteous hustling , trife corruption
look how these ogs with the mics is muscling
i fight for justice , but minus the red cape
dollar short , year late , suckers is scared straight
they know i'm hotter than a box where the bread bake
and brought j. period to cut through the red tape
