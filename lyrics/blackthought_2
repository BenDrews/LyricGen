*after 2 minutes of talking*
yo so let's get the mic burned , open it up
yes i , check it out
it's like , you listen to the musician
umbilicle mic , my syllable strikes ya vision
i take you through a tunnel of thought , wit no support
now you got caught off guard , by the number one scar for the illa - fifth
lyrically for feelin this , black thought yo the skill assisted
by the mal - ik b , the symbol you remember me to be type valid
disasterous , the master just bust this , for the listener
black thought yo , while i exhibit the
styles , from the artist , boast strokes of lyrical darkness , enter the style
severin rooms just like apartments , ill flavor
i'm a skyscraper by nature
down wit my number one neighbor , common
off the top - a , the dome lyric - al don - datta mr. trotter
aiyyo we gotta lotta mc's , on the line of this ready to rhyme
so i'm just gon' set go down wit mine , rewind , check it out
i persue sound fairs , relaxed like dru down's hair
other niggas rhymes are like gang signs , i throw down theirs
on knotts i landed , players get played like hamlet
supposedly nice , taken for granted like life
i write twice and drop singles in record pools
niggas i'm dunkin like when cops mingle , fuck hip hop jingles
rhymin big words and not sayin shit
the click that you came in wit , the accent you flavor whipped
i got my nigga tariq , i freak it in the middle of the week
niggas is weak an' and i start to speakin
niggas start to leakin , my nigga derek d an'
i'm foreseein the future , funky for human beings
like i was the biz mark , i bring the noise iller
com sense'll be the rhyme killer , i spill a
little bit of juice to a mc who need a new producer
got my nigga y - not in the spot and i rock like crack
i'm ready to attack , thoughts is black
niggas understand the intelligence and relevance to this rhyme
i stretch a nigga all across the line like i was bobbito or armstrong
com's song'll keep goin , i start the holdin
my flowin is turnin to earth
the birth is comin through , listenin to cut old school *laughin*
? tremblin when it came down the shoot ?
( pharoahe ) yeah yeah ( pharoahe ) yeah yeah
( pharoahe ) yeah yeah yo
always beginnin em , forever blendin them , bendin em again and again
sendin em back , lettin em know that minimum wages
subliminally befriending em for criminal ac - tivity
mics i chop like florida state seminoles wit criminal facts
and milly ac - tually i piss on your promotional wax
it'll be tight but only this , what nigga swears he's the nicest
just because he got rhyme of the month twice
four mic devices , the gem star blade the shit slices
rip - trip - chop - chop - chop and dices , absolute
absolute uh , absolute uh , absolute uh ( kill it )
yes , rippin the microphone
my words will enlight your dome
when i'm quick to strike your home just like capone
n - noreaga , wit the war report , my orrator will slaughter yours
still waitin for the beat to come in , i'm dangerous like satan
eatin bacon in front of a muslim , i'll battle you and your cousin
it's the beef for black attack
when i , yes quick to subtract the wack
when i go from track to track , bouncin in the mounds and coutin
flowin like water from a fountain when i deliver
like water from a river makin you shiver
that's for sore , the connoisseur rippin ill - literature
yes , but i'm about to get deeper
you'll catch a ill reflection from listenin too close to the speaker
when i reach ya , it's gettin more clearer , outta the era
it's like this , we keep you open like a parachute
took a shot of hip hop , it's absolute
for my man from the house of representatives
and turn it out , aiyyo i always do , that's what i'mma bout ta
do i show you a style and throw you ?
for all competitors , black thought comin through the seckle cuz
i'm the superior style and you inferior
let me adjust my voice so you can hear me ta - -
bust rule the , microphone
pure skills , nuttin but it , all of a sudden
mc's just start to studdered from the rap style
hey yo let me rewind check it out , check it out
well it's the , deranged style that change formats and forms
i swarm like killa bees for feelin these fantasies
mc's throw a tantrum , i sing the fifth anthem
aiyyo it's like this , my song thump your preference
you can never attempt to reach that where my level is
black thought severin competitives , off the dome top
yo my microphone stop , my man com just drop
and don't halt , i guess it was my fault
i came through thick like a malt , niggas tried to pour salt
but never knew the flavor , my shit is accented from chicago
niggas follow , hold the water bottle
my shit'll keep flowin
now i'm showin this poetry in motion like a picure
read the scripture , understood the first new testament
start to blessin it
the shit is like this , where the beat went
i give mc's the silent treatment
they tried to come against me , i told em they wasn't fresh
rappers i crush , kill and destroy like stress
extinction agenda , com sense'll just send a - nother
mothafucker to the bathroom , he didn't have room to shit on the mic
that i had , it's like the nigga com sense , i don't need a pad
off the dome , my shit'll roam/rome like a greek
i start to speak , and niggas sound extra weak/week
like seven days , i take ya seven whole days like tony
never been a phony , express styles like a pony
hold ya horses , com sense read the sources
toss this type of shit that go straight through , i lost this
one time , it came back the rap sunshine
niggas follow me like one time
check it out nig - - my man absolute is unsigned , ready to get it on
it's like this upon the mic yo i sit upon
yo yo , check it out now , one time now , pharoahe monch yo
it's not breaks at the bar , even if you a star
wit me and my crew baby doll you won't go far
i seek the love of allah , the laws i lay
peepin the upper echelon of light display
funk distributed rap pro , attributed to facts so
cleverly put , more revolutions than a axel
the sad slow nigga much smoother than coltrane
who can cop beats that i chop like cocaine
the effortless action wit moves like subtraction
lip , stick and admit wit mo' satisfaction
and all the while my beats can pile up
more data than x - file shows all added up
the educated nigga from queens , by any means
servin any fiends , similar to supreme team
but like steam i will rise to the top to redeem the cream
for niggas who fiend for hip hop
i pop glock and bla - block shot and chop spots
positioning , what absolute , what c'mon c'mon kick the dome
the last word was precision so i get a vision
and makin sentences on top of your cranium
underground , sub - terranien
crossin the mediterranean , water to slaughter mc's
who can't catch across the border
lookin across , the window , not a nympho
lookin at my man , the jedi duck when the lead fly
my man just took a picture , so i just snapped it
lookin at the man who got the joint in his back shit , the back shit
i pack shit but it's never like an automatic
i'm causin static just like the opposite of bounce
i get , throwing mad amounts
look at my man bobbito and stretch
i gotta catch the beat
i'm never come off weak cuz weak is the opposite of strong
i used to smoke the bong but now i got the heineken
it's my turn to rhyme again
don't need to be greedy , i give my old gear to the needy
used to write graffiti cuz i got the burner
you might not get that but you i pass it back to my man wit the head wrap
yo
