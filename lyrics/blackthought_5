*thought is like...*
kato 808 in my rhymes , the green hornet
at times i lean on it , ya'll just fiend on it
i'm cold fronting throughout the metro
piloting , baby , the globe is my area
yeah the most feared villain in america
toss the trigger i use to hit the sheriff up
now i'm convincing these dudes to get their lyrics up
ya'll niggas bull' too much , ya'll niggas said enough
sickin' competitors , heavily stressing this with ya
my medicine ? ya'll finna go see the therapist
i gotta settle it black , metal to metal
with these brothers on that bullshit pot , calling the kettle crisp
what could be better bitch ? i'm rocking the flag with the green , black and red
and you're on the confederate , boy , you work for merill lynch
ya'll ain't fucking with a brother hell bent on success , i'm living evidence
see it's really all about sensation and the fascination
we got to chase it : dreams
i'm trying to be the champ , you're in to racing
cause fuck wasting time on the consolation prize
something undetectable to ya'll naked eyes
still its probably more real than ya'll recognize
i specialize in raw , carnivorous rhyming
better silence it ya'll , you couldn't size it
the fourth horseman , give rise over the blade
its going to cut you to a different size
in the days of guerrilla warfare
making a change , like carfare
i want these chumps taken off here
sip my morning coffee , kiss my baby girl
tell my lady friend i'm gone until i save the world
jump in my hotrod wheel , looking super thorough
rocking an all black cape like the duke of earl
the essence of a movement on some smooth shit
langston hughes mixed in with some stanley kubrick
sick , still yet i'm savvy , penning a nasty masterpiece
that convey my sentiment exactly
black : i'm that nice son from michaelango or michael eric dyson
slicing like a viking , dog , i'm white lightning
i'm caught with a bone , with a slight tick in my mind
it's tight frightening
the flow is part mozart and part malcom
clearly you ain't fearing , you already know the outcome
another victory , we're making history
i'm stronger than the walls in the penitentiary
