up steps the one and only in the flesh
cynically sierra leonian fresh to death
big homie and them reps the best
knew you know me from somewhere
i get wrecked with questlover
the brother get it on , bring a song
more brutal than genghis khan
whose name ring alarms to fakes
you couldn't place but know i'm the truth
that's before you recognize it's the one from the roots
armed to the tooth , trying to take a eye for another eye
i'm from " we hear gunfire for a lullaby "
yo , forget it , who the hell am i ?
yo , i'm the reason these mcs' lies became nullified
the stuff of legend , so tell me what's tougher , brethren
when i'm the blast from the past that started the present
vision of the future , me and the super producer
and i'm ten times smart as i'm used to be
and i'm still seeing the voice through the speakers
porsche two seaters , jimmy choo speakers
real rap remedy man , a true genius
i brought yosemite sam two heaters
asking these bastards if it's any last words
besides " what , when , why ? " and all them adverbs
you bout to be the next fugitive captured
just keep thinking you can lie and live after
slow your roll , playboy - - rabbit ears
cuz damn right it's on sight like vladimir
and by the moment in time you will be outta there
strapped , getting slapped for acting so cavalier
i come from philly and them cowards don't travel there
brothers let the heat rattle there , they don't battle there
itching to leave you in a pool like mike phelps
learning to fight might help , but that's light help
because if bullets make flack melt
then imagine just what it'd do to you , even if you a black belt
ayo my brother still concealing with a gat held
on a block where it used to be a lot of crack dealt
lo and behold , this is information overload
i put the crowd in a trance like paul oakenfold
i used to be the lowest on the totem pole
until i reconstructed my goals , left a broken mold
setting sights on a open road
i hit up anywhere and everywhere
that realness is bought and sold
ayo they got me on an honor roll
that means whenever speaking my name
begin that with " the honorable "
t - a - r one " i " like a monocle
i bring the riot through and laugh cuz you're comical
look , get in that ass like your father do
hit that catatonic chronic out in bonnaroo
i'm psychological , jump like " geronimo ! "
probably get yourself knocked down like a domino
whoa , if i don't work then i won't eat
no , i don't facebook but i might tweet
the industry is out of control like oc
so take this l on the chin like it's a goatee
i'm kinda like a cellar door , i'm lowkey
i used to mix bottles of champale with oe
i'm aristotle , i can't fail , i'm og
i came through to get free like no fee
hey yo they got me on a pedestal , trophy
got em singing damn riq , cheating like adultery
sycamore , sitting on paper like upholstery
noam chomsky , i'm on an organized rhyme spree
messing with this is a borderline robbery
and that's what it is , i'm jimbrowski
certain circles call me the big lebowski
it would behoove you to find out about me
