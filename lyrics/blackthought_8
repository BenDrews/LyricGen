i'm hip hop like gazelles in a kango
they say i'm so off the chain like django
i'm on a mission like argo , i'm not insane though
i pick my movie tickets up at fandango
to see les miserables with russell crowe and anne hathaway
them beasts of the southern wild with quvenzhan√©
i'm thinking one of the best was lincoln starring daniel day
but then again the life of pi is definetely a candidate
what's that movie with de niro ? hardly talked dirty
the silver linings playbook or zero dark thirty ?
even that chick flick amour is still award worthy
the oscars is airing live , i'd hit record early
