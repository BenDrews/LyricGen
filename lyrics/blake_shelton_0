run ol' bocephus through a jukebox needle
at the honky - tonk , where their boots stomp
all night , what

gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
to get paid , to get the girl
and your 4 wheel drive
a country boy can survive

drinking that ice cold beer
talkin' 'bout girls , talkin' 'bout trucks
runnin' them red dirt roads out , kicking up dust
the boys 'round here
sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
backwoods legit , don't take no shit
chew tobacco , chew tobacco , chew tobacco , spit
aw heck
