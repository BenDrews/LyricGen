when you put two and two together
you figure out love's got four letters
i shoulda known that when i met her
but she had to spell it out for me
after all that second guessing
it's been a long hard history lesson
hell that's a class i got an f in
but now i understand perfectly
she put the her in hurt
she put the why in try
she put the s.o.b. in sober
she put the hang in hangover ( hangover )
she put the ex in sex
she put the low in blow
she put a big f.u. in my future
yeah she’s got a way
she’s got a way with words
yeah she's got a way with words
little words like " i " and " do "
lying , cheating , screwed
yeah all the words i thought i knew
they got a brand new meaning now
she put the her in hurt
she put the why in try
she put the s.o.b. in sober
she put the hang in hangover ( hangover )
she put the ex in sex
she put the low in blow
she put a big f.u. in my future
yeah she’s got a way
she’s got a way with words
( oh - oh - oh - oh
oh - oh - oh - oh )
