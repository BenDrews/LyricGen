baby where are you going now ?
do you ever really know ?
oh you hate to be tied down
but you hate to sleep alone
i bet you still think about me
yeah i bet you still think about me
like i think about you
even when i don't want to
there’s just something about you baby
there’s nothing that i can do
i think about you , you were always wild and free
i know we couldn’t hold on forever , but baby
i bet you still think about me
are you driving up the coast ?
are you wearing any shoes ?
did you outrun all your ghosts ?
like you were always tryna do...
i bet you still think about me
yeah i bet you still think about me
like i think about you
even when i don't want to
there’s just something about you baby
there’s nothing that i can do
i think about you , you were always wild and free
i know we couldn’t hold on forever , but baby
i bet you still think about me
like i think about you
even when i don't want to
there’s just something about you baby
there’s nothing that i can do
i think about you , you were always wild and free
i know we couldn’t hold on forever , but baby
i bet you still think about me
yeah i bet you still think about me
yeah i bet you still think about me
