what's your all - time high , your good as it gets ?
your hands down best ever make - up sex ?
what's your guilty pleasure , your old go to ?
well if you asked me , mine would be you
what's your worst hangover , your best night yet ?
your 90 proof , your marlboro red ?
the best damn thing you lucked into
that's easy girl , mine would be you
mine would be you
sun keeps shinin' , back road flyin'
singin' like crazy fools
makin' up our own words , laughin' 'til it hurts
baby , if i had to choose
my best day ever , my finest hour
my wildest dream come true
mine would be you
what's your double dare , your go all in ?
the craziest thing you ever did ?
plain as your name in this tattoo
look on my arm , mine would be you
mine would be you
sun keeps shinin' , back road flyin'
singin' like crazy fools
makin' up our own words , laughin' 'til it hurts
baby , if i had to choose
my best day ever , my finest hour
my wildest dream come true
mine would be you
what's the greatest chapter in your book ?
are there pages where it hurts to look ?
what's the one regret you can't work through ?
you got it baby , mine would be you
yeah , you got it baby , mine would be you
mine would be you
taillights fadin' , daylight breakin'
standing there like a fool
when i should've been runnin' , yellin' out somethin'
to make you want to hold on to
the best love ever , girl , can you tell me
the one thing you'd rather die than lose ?
'cause mine would be you
mine would be... you
