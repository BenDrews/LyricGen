i never thought youâ€™d pick up the phone
it's friday night , you should be out on the town
didn't think you'd be sittin' at home all alone like me
nothin' on tv , nothin' to do
nothin' to keep my mind off you and me
and the way it was
are you thinkin' 'bout it now because
i could be there in five
one more one last time
we don't have to be lonely tonight
( i need you , want you , i'm right here )
we don't have to be lonely tonight
( i know we shouldn't , but i don't care )
i don't wanna be right , i don't wanna be strong
i just wanna hold you till the heartbreak's gone
when the sun comes up , we can both move on
but we don't have to be lonely tonight
that taste , that touch , the fire i miss
those kiss me eyes , your red wine lips on mine
like it used to be
baby i want you and and you want me and
we don't have to be lonely tonight
( i need you , want you , i'm right here )
we don't have to be lonely tonight
( i know we shouldn't , but i don't care )
i don't wanna be right , i don't wanna be strong
i just wanna hold you till the heart breaks stone
when the sun comes up , we can both move on
but we don't have to be lonely tonight
i can be there in five
one more one last time
we don't have to be lonely tonight
( oh , i need you , and i'm right here )
we don't have to be lonely tonight , tonight , tonight
yeah , yeah
