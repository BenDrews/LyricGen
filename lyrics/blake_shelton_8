sometimes i'm the guy with the boys kicking it back
or the guy with the guitar singing on a country track
i might be the guy with an ice cold can , stirring up dust on some old farmland
when i walk into the party with you girl , you change all that
i’m just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
wishin' you were there alone
wonderin' how i ever got your little hand in mine
lookin' over at ya like " ain’t she beautiful ? "
i’m invisible but i stand right there and smile
you're right beside me , oh and i see the same thing they’re seein'
but i don’t mind being the guy with the girl , no
it's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
they come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
and i don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
they keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
it's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come into the room
and i turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
wishin' you were there alone
wonderin' how i ever got your little hand in mine
lookin' over at ya like " ain’t she beautiful ? "
i’m invisible but i stand right there and smile
you're right beside me , oh and i see the same thing they’re seein'
but i don’t mind being the guy with the girl
the guy that don't know how he got her
but he ain't never gon' let her , never gon' let her go
woah - oh , yeah
i’m just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
wishin' you were there alone
wonderin' how i ever got your little hand in mine
lookin' over at ya like " ain’t she beautiful ? "
i’m invisible but i stand right there and smile
you're right beside me , oh and i see the same thing they’re seein'
but i don’t mind being the guy with the girl
( guy with the girl )
no , i don't mind being the guy with the girl
( guy with the girl )
yeah , i'm just the guy with the girl
i'm always the guy with the girl
i don't mind it baby
i don't mind it baby
i'm always the guy with the girl
