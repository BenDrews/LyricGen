there's something 'bout yesterday
how fast it all flies away
i don't know what it is about a goodbye kiss
that makes you wanna stay
we were crazy then we were over
we were breaking up , making love , a runaway roller coaster
every time i hear that song
i’m standing in the pouring rain
on your front lawn and oh - oh - oh
i still think about you oh - oh - oh
every time i hear that song
it's like the first time it came on and oh - oh - oh
i still think about you oh - oh - oh
i still think about you
there’s something in the bittersweet
the feeling of a memory
right there in the moment
all i ever wanted was you and me
we were crying , we were wasted
we were dying when they played it
every time i hear that song
i’m standing in the pouring rain
on your front lawn and oh - oh - oh
i still think about you oh - oh - oh
every time i hear that song
it's like the first time it came on and oh - oh - oh
i still think about you oh - oh - oh
i still think about you
oh i still think about you
there's a soundtrack in my mind
that takes me back in time
when i hear that melody
i think about you and me
every time i hear that song
i’m standing in the pouring rain
on your front lawn and oh - oh - oh
i still think about you oh - oh - oh
every time i hear that song
it's like the first time it came on and oh - oh - oh
i still think about you oh - oh - oh
i still think about you
oh , i still think about you
i still think about you
yeah , i still think about you
there's a soundtrack in my mind
that takes me back in time
when i hear that melody
