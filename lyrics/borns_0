candy , she's sweet like candy in my veins
baby , i'm dying for another taste
and every night my mind is running around her
thunder's getting louder and louder
baby you're like lightning in a bottle
i can't let you go now that i got it
and all i need is to be struck
by your electric love
baby your electric love
electric love
drown me , you make my heart beat like the rain
surround me , hold me deep beneath your waves
and every night my mind is running around her
thunder's getting louder and louder
baby you're like lightning in a bottle
i can't let you go now that i got it
and all i need is to be struck
by your electric love
baby your electric love
electric love
rushing though me
feel your energy rushing through me
feel your energy rushing through me
baby you're like lightning in a bottle
i can't let you go now that i got it
and all i need is to be struck by your electric love
baby your electric love
baby you're electric
baby you're electric
baby you're electric
