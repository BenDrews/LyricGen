i'll dive in deeper , deeper for you
down to the bottom , 10 , 000 emerald pools
down to the bottom , 10 , 000 emerald pools
under water
time is standing still
you're the treasure
dive down deeper
still , all i need is you
you're all i need to breathe
all i need is you !
i'll make a living , trying to get away
10 , 000 fathoms , under a tidal wave
it can never pull me away
no way !
under water
time is standing still
you're the treasure
dive down deeper

you're all i need to breathe
all i need is you !
you're all i need to breathe

you're all i need to breathe
i'll dive in deeper , deeper for you
you're all i need to breathe
all i need is you !
all i need is you !
