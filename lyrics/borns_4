shadows fill my mind up
zeroes tell me my time's up
i lost count so long ago ; maybe my heart's numb
don't hold my hands accountable ; they're young and they're dumb
drive through the timezones
escape out of my mind zone , love
i lost you not long ago ; heaven knows i'm miserable
hell takes all the credit , though , till the day is done
the emotion is suddenly out of me
the emotion is building up inside of me
and what you're looking for is suddenly out of reach
the emotion , the emotion
islands under eyelids
spilling in through the silence
you were all that , all that , all that i needed
and we're falling , falling to the deep and now
the emotion is suddenly out of me
the emotion is building up inside of me
and what you're looking for is suddenly out of reach
the emotion , the emotion
rolling through the dark
carved into the light of day
both eyes are open now , i'm running
i won't turn around for you
the emotion is suddenly out of me
the emotion is building up inside of me
and what you're looking for is suddenly out of reach
the emotion , the emotion
