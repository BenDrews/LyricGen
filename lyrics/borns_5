baby , baby , baby
i was scared of being lost in love
i crave it on the daily
that sugar pill that dosed me up
ooh , it's raining it's pouring
i picture you in the morning
the hot water and the steam
oh the way that you feel between
both my hands , on your hourglass
the minutes and the hours pass
i wanna watch you bloom
gimme that sweet perfume
it's making my heart beat so fast
in my mind , you're the angel on the painted glass
looking for high , divine , connection
i'm a lover , in need of confession
let me satisfy your soul
not a saint , but do i have to be ?
well baby , you're my holy ghost
and i need you close , come back to me
baby , baby , baby , baby
i fantasize and i pray
i'm thirsty for your ecstasy
so open up your heavenly gates
ooh , your tenderness is paradise
baby take me there and i will
worship at your feet
you can have my soul to keep
it's making my heart beat so fast
in my mind , you're the angel on the painted glass
looking for high , divine , connection
i'm a lover , in need of confession
let me satisfy your soul
not a saint , but do i have to be ?
well baby , you're my holy ghost
and i need you close , come back to me
( back to me , back to me , back to me )
( back to me , back to me , back to me )
( back to me , back to me , back to me )
( back to me , back to me , back to me )
let me satisfy your soul
not a saint , but do i have to be ?
well baby , you're my holy ghost
and i need you close , come back to me , back to me
let me satisfy your wide awake soul
no i don't care if it's blasphemy
cause baby , you're my holy ghost
and i need you close , come back to me
( back to me , back to me , back to me )
( holy ghost )
