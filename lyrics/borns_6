wanna feel that stream of dopamine
wanna feel that stream of dopamine
i mixed up so terribly
your body language talking over me
and it might not be logical
but baby my mind just won't let you leave
and i crave your taste under my tongue everyday
keep the forbidden fruit coming my way
i wanna feel your sugar in my veins
baby just wanna feel
wanna feel that stream of dopamine
wanna feel that stream of dopamine
you sip what the devil's drinking
hot as hell and i'm thinkin'
baby , baby , baby can you take away my pain ?
baby , baby , baby can you take away my pain ?
baby i don't wanna think about it
all i wanna be is under your control
sound of your spell , locked in your eyes
under your influence , don't let me go
and i crave your taste under my tongue everyday
keep the forbidden fruit coming my way
i wanna feel your sugar in my veins
baby just wanna feel
wanna feel that stream of dopamine
wanna feel that stream of dopamine
you sip what the devil's drinking
hot as hell and i'm thinkin'
baby , baby , baby , can you take away my pain
baby , baby , baby , can you take away my pain
laying in your ecstasy , i'm floating away
laying in your ecstasy , i'm floating away
wanna feel that stream of dopamine
wanna feel that stream of dopamine
wanna feel that stream of dopamine
wanna feel that stream of dopamine
you sip what the devil's drinking
hot as hell and i'm thinkin'
baby , baby , baby , can you take away my pain ?
baby , baby , baby , can you take away my pain ?
laying in your ecstasy , i'm floating away
laying in your ecstasy , i'm floating away
laying in your ecstasy , i'm floating away
laying in your ecstasy , i'm floating away
