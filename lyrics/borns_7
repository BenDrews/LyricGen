you dug my heart a grave
i watched you illustrate the expression of another lonely girl
and there you lie awake
and wish you knew a way to fade the blaring silence from your only world
and now you're running to the sound of the light
running to the sound of the light
running to the sound of the light
ooh , oh
it’s inevitable , ain’t it ?
you left without saying
ooh , oh
i hope the cracks in the pavement , lead back to you baby
back to you baby
i burnt so many memories
just to make room for any
thoughts of caressing your sweet
anatomy as we sleep
the taste you left on my teeth
your breath across my left cheek
the feeling chemically , oh
and now you're running to the sound of the light
running to the sound of the light
ooh , oh
it’s inevitable , ain’t it ?
you left without saying
ooh , oh
i hope the cracks in the pavement , lead back to you baby
back to you baby
and now you're running to the sound of the light
running to the sound of the light
running to the sound of the light
ooh , oh
it’s inevitable , ain’t it ?
you left without saying
ooh , oh
i hope the cracks in the pavement , lead back to you baby
back to you baby
