i go walking each night
get a physical reaction
when you're on the path and my mind
metaphysical attraction
call it a curse from the full moon
flowing in my bloodstream
i can feel it like a monsoon
hovering above me
oh , but i don't mind it
i can't escape the air
the wind always brings me the scent of her hair
all kinds of crazy you're making me
i can't keep my mind off you
got me losing my cool
got me acting like a fool
fool , fool
yeah , yeah , yeah
fool , fool
like a fool
i go walking seaside , hear the music of the ocean
swimming through the wreckage of my mind in the deepest of emotions
oh , but i don't mind it
watching you in the sand
the thought of you slipping through the cracks of my hands
all kinds of crazy you're making me
i can't keep my mind off you
got me losing my cool
got me acting like a fool
fool , fool
yeah , yeah , yeah
fool , fool
like a fool
all kinds of crazy you're making me
i can't keep my mind off you
got me losing my cool
got me acting like a fool
fool , fool
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah
fool , fool
like a fool
fool , fool
yeah , yeah , yeah
