i forget all my dreams
i forget everyones name i meet
i forget about time and space
but i can't stop thinking 'bout your face
i can't stop thinking 'bout your face
clouds are rolling by
i open my mouth and i breathe them right in
all my thoughts dip away
but i can't stop thinking 'bout your face
i can't stop thinking 'bout your face
oh , i won't stop
til you knock on my door
won't stop
til you knock on my door
i forget this and that
i forget about the shit that doesn't matter
my memory could be erased
and i'd still be thinking 'bout your face
oh , i won't stop
til you knock on my door
won't stop
til you knock on my door
