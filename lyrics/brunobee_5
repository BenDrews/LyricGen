secreting in secret in slits in the stone a fat spider abides ,
yellow and evil and godawful stripes down his sides ,
a species the desert derives.
to that rising thing
each sunrise we bring
in our hands the gift offerings :
a chip of emerald , a babe of the flies ,
a scarab beetle bristling and hissing black things ;
a mottled blooddrop , a godly burnabee bug.
and with a whole sacrifice fettered in webs till it dies
together we behold a final convulsion in fire.
a beloved pet he is : our rabbi and our teacher ,
our heart's desire.
a tangled web he weaves between us of twisted love and abomination.
and with our belongings already we've brought the next creature ,
the long , unwinding , writhing , reptile : spider - eater.
