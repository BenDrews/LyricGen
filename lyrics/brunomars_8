easy come , easy go
that's just how you live , oh
take , take , take it all , but you never give
shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
had your eyes wide open
why were they open ? ( ooh )
gave you all i had and you tossed it in the trash
you tossed it in the trash , you did
to give me all your love is all i ever ask
cause what you don't understand is...
i'd catch a grenade for ya
throw my hand on a blade for ya
i'd jump in front of a train for ya
you know i'd do anything for ya
ooh , i would go through all this pain
take a bullet straight through my brain
yes , i would die for ya , baby
but you won't do the same
no , no , no , no , oh
black , black , black and blue
beat me 'til i'm numb
tell the devil i said , " hey " when you get back to where you're from
mad woman , bad women
that's just what you are
yeah , you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car
gave you all i had and you tossed it in the trash
you tossed it in the trash , yes you did
to give me all your love is all i ever ask
cause what you don't understand is...
i'd catch a grenade for ya
throw my hand on a blade for ya
i'd jump in front of a train for ya
you know i'd do anything for ya
ooh , i would go through all this pain
take a bullet straight through my brain
yes , i would die for ya , baby
but you won't do the same
if my body was on fire
ooh , you'd watch me burn down in flames
you said you loved me , you're a liar
cause you never , ever , ever did , baby
but darlin' i'd still...
catch a grenade for ya
throw my hand on a blade for ya
i'd jump in front of a train for ya
you know i'd do anything for ya
oh , i would go through all this pain
take a bullet straight through my brain
yes , i would die for ya , baby
but you won't do the same
no , you won't do the same
you wouldn't do the same
ooh , you'd never do the same
no , no , no , no oh
