look up in the sky , where you'd rather be
lie to yourself , you can't lie to me
you see lights , camera and action
everything ain't for everyone , son , stop rapping
look up in the sky , where you'd rather be
lie to yourself , you can't lie to me
i see true careers collapsing
everything ain't for everyone , son , stop rapping
damn , you make it look so easy
for me to get paid , but this shit crazy
i've been at it for five joints
and i still ain't make a profit or pocket one point
i paid for my trip to the uk
even spent more than the grip in two days
i figured , ay , if i'mma blow right now
then i'mma go right now , my dough low right now
but it'll , loosen up as i'm moving up the charts
but the only charts i see is a bus
my money feel cold like crush
but me and my niggas hot so i know it ain't us
we the shit and we ain't even sell a record yet
every nigga on the block saying son a vet
the mixtape don , the father of the features
the problem is none of the features coming out neither
so you can now neither
come forward or say " son , i ain't gonna blow , and i know it "
i can't show it
i should have kept my nine to five
but hip hop had me believing that i should try

gucci , louis , louis , gucci
niggas kill me when they say they making movies
you're no bruce lee
return of the dragon , enter the dragon
enter the stage , y'all can imagine
it's no beauty pageant , you don't get picked
you put in work , and then they love you cause you didn't quit
you don't make movies , you make skits
for little tricks in your neighborhood , then you disappear quick
david blaine , you can save the blame , for yourself
cause you fucked up , boy , no one else
telling yourself , yeah , we on tour
when you been around the world in your bullshit honda accord
ops , a minivan , do you get any fans ?
say you the best , not yet , change of plans
go get another career
cause hip hop is like a ball head , for you it's not here
look up in the sky , where you'd rather be
lie to yourself , you can't lie to me
