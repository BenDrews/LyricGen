buckshot rip the body apart
come through wit the lyrical art , follow the spark
i'mma leave the blind thru the dark
gather up the ganja come aboard the arc
like noah , i don't show a nigga he ain't ready for this
shot the snake and make him venomless , stop the
hissin , this is ridiculous
i'm about to get ready and bomb this shit
raise the thugs wit the heater in the arm for shit
marijuana when you drive , feel the fogginess
i'm about to cause a war , a cannibalistic thing
feel this thing , shit , at night , you hear the bang bang
buckshot is just doin his thang thang
you can see the glare as chains swing
bd get up in the cypher of a shame game to maintain

cuz i'm , dangerous , i remain wit this
never forgettin them original niggas on my list

boogie , how could he , he really thought that i was blind
the light at the end of the tunnel , brought me to the surface
no longer nervous , but now my purpose is
to bomb the world wit bcc , travel through my odyssey
it's gotta be me , if it's gotta be
let the battle begin , nine o'clock on the dot , set the water start
slaughter the chart then , the sky's darken
clouds travel to the rhythm of the violin
calm the savage beast like leviathan
ini , many men , said rasta mon na dred
chalest instead of the philly , really , see me , bd
whenever i speak , i get to the point like a tb
what's the deal , what's the deal ?
1 , 2 , 3 , everybody it's the bd
you can follow me , follow bdb
1 , 2 , 3 , everybody it's the bdb
you can follow bdi , if you need the god , follow with pride
keep the gun tip by the upper lip
keep a extra clip , just in case he flip
if i'm high in my ride , then i gotta dip
quick to losin my composure , but i can't slip
it's been a hard road , and i been walkin this
and did a lot of hustlin to get you off of this
i got a bank roll , grow like fungus
so much money , ya niggas wanna come among us
live like kings , do our things
but let me tell ya muthafuckas what money brings
niggas schemin on your rides , schemin on your rings
target every night , just follow the red beam
it's a mission , and the mission is to stay alive
shit , the streets don't want me to survive
but i gotta strive
1 , 2 , 3 , everybody it's the bd mc
if you need a god , follow with pride
you can follow it's bdi
