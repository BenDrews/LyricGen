yeah
" industry shakedown "
i call this one
the industry shakedown
word up
uh huh
" industry shakedown "
now the reason i call it... the industry shakedown
is cuz alot of niggas have fucked up
" word up , industry shakedown "
now what i mean by fucked up is
they don't wanna see the game played right
" word up , word up "
so me and my nigga pete rock
gon show y'all how to play the game right
" get ready for the industry shakedown "
" word up , word up "
word up , word up "
uh , uh
i can't stop rockin i was born to keep it hot
fought through miles of pain just to get what i got
without crying , took mad shots without dying
y'all know when i'm in town mad heads start flyin
who ever thought that i would be dealt the hand
that would make me the most feared lyrical man
ask tone how it feel not to be able to sleep
i was layin on him in his dream squeezing on the heat
i kept the pressure on him , now , i'm universal
now he played this money game called hand , reversal
i remember when i thought that i could rock at def jam
while i was watching all these niggas caught up in a def scam
i remember when i stepped to lyor , i should've blown him
cuz that cracker been a crook , ever since i first known him
thought i'd sale to atlantic
but there's niggas workin for 'em that'll sink the whole label
like the fucking titanic
what i gotta do is run some dick up in sylvia rhone
so she can hear bumpy rockin on this microphone
maybe i can elektra - fy her brain
show her how i take love and turn it to pain
i never been an ass kisser
i call it if it's right , if rappers ain't gay or dikes
then they unpluggin your mic
my shit is cordless , i'm thugged out and wild as shit
and i'm comin for my crown , it's bumpy knuckles baby
the industry shakedown
" word up , word up "
ha !
" word up , word up "
" ready for the industry shakedown "
yeah !
" word up , word up "
" industry shakedown "
" word up , word up "
that's right nigga
me and my nigga pete rock gon show you motherfuckers how to shake it down
you ready for this one ? check it out
when i spit hot potato , i was peepin tommy boy
but didn't wanna be the the next act that they would destroy
see labels be all on your dick , when they see you have some paper
but i flip the game , cuz i pull the capers
got way more nut , than date rapers
you better be tryin to get yourself an office
way on top of that skyscraper
i bring the ruckus , your money lookin proper
have you ever been stuck up by a hardcore hip hopper
forgot ya signed to cappa , a real donnie brasco
a nigga wit mics and tape recorders , all up in his asshole
speakin of police , i found a interscope
and when i looked through the hole what i saw was dope
i saw a new nigga , sittin behind a big desk
wit a big head and a big chest
and a big belly , talkin on a celly
hatin real players , cuttin niggas throats
like he was tryin to be the mayor
then some niggas rushed in , punched him in his mouth
threw him down on the floor and started stompin him out
screamin fuck steve stoute , serve street justice
cryin on the floor wit your lip all busted
you went out like a pussy , fuck the dough you got
cuz wit all that money nigga , you still can't buy a heart
only gangstas play the part
i'm still around , to bring you , the industry shakedown
ha !
" word up , word up "
to the pete rock , and you don't stop
to the pete rock , and you don't stop
my nigga pete rock , and you don't stop
i never felt like i should have to hold back anything i say
so i make the kinda records red alert don't play
because i flow too hard , my voice is penetratin
or maybe your crate needs renovatin , i'm used to hatin
that's why i'm hockey on you niggas , stickin and skatin
i heard about the blaze battle , they asked me to be in it
but to not consider me one of the 50 great
so i reviewed my tapes , figured my position
sat and thought for a minute , grabbed the phone and said listen
i sell less records than some niggas out wit a deal
gettin more cash and all my diamonds is real
and you want me to battle for a rolie , that i'mma take anyway
better leave me the fuck alone bumpy knucks don't play
it made me laugh when i think about how gary harris
tried to play me than got fired and all fuckin embarrassed
fly shit is that he saw me , wit a smile , at a club
reached to shake my fuckin hand and , brought back a nub
all them temporary spots will be filled time again
you can hate me now but i will rhyme again
fall down climb again , more wild , more corrupt
still spittin more shit , more fire , more abrupt
and i'll never put my two guns down
why's that
cuz i need 'em... for the industry shakedown
" word up , word up "
c'mon !
" word up , word up "
yeah !
" industry shakedown "
that's right
that's what the fuck i call , a industry shakedown
" word up , word up "
and it's a lotta motherfuckers out there that i didn't name in this
motherfucking song but i tell you this much
" get ready for the industry shakedown "
don't think i forgot motherfuckers , cuz i reserve my options
it's bumpy knuckles baby , ha
" word up , word up "
and the chocolate boy wonder
i show you niggas a fast way , to six feet
