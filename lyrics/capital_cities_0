i could lift you up
i could show you what you want to see
and take you where you want to be
you could be my luck
even if the sky is falling down
i know that we'll be safe and sound
we're safe and sound
i could fill your cup
you know my river won't evaporate
this world we still appreciate
you could be my luck
even in a hurricane of frowns
i know that we'll be safe and sound
( safe and sound ) we're safe and sound
( safe and sound ) we're safe and sound
( hold your ground ) we're safe and sound
( safe and sound )
i could show you love
in a tidal wave of mystery
you'll still be standing next to me
you could be my luck
even if we're six feet underground
i know that we'll be safe and sound
we're safe and sound
we're safe and sound
( safe and sound )
( safe and sound )
( hold your ground )
( safe and sound )
i could lift you up
i could show you what you want to see
and take you where you want to be
you could be my luck
even if the sky is falling down
i know that we'll be safe and sound
i could show you what you want to see
you could be my luck
even if the sky is falling down
i know that we'll be safe and sound
we're safe and sound
we're safe and sound
we're safe and sound
we're safe and sound
( safe and sound ) we're safe and sound
( safe and sound ) we're safe and sound
( hold your ground ) we're safe and sound
( safe and sound )
