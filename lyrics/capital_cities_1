i like it when you're under the ocean and all you can feel is calm
i like it when i'm sleeping
i like it when i'm listening to music because that's the only thing that takes me to another world ( another world )
i like it when public bathrooms have scented candles
i like it when you talk to me like that
i like it when my hair is fluffy
i like it when it rains at night and i'm curled up in bed with a good book
i like it when i turn my head around and i catch you looking back
you know it when you see it
you know it when it's there

like farrah fawcett hair
it's good shit ( i like it when you play with my hair )
it's good shit ( i like it when you play with my hair )
