there’s a dark part of town
where the girls get down
and i cannot wait for a chance to go
wait for a chance to go
i’ve got my bad luck shoes and every excuse
to dance these blues away
ain’t coming home
i ain’t coming home
shut up , shut up , shut up
sit up , sit up , sit up
it’s a kangaroo court
a kangaroo court
shut up , shut up , shut up
sit up , sit up , sit up
it’s a kangaroo court
a kangaroo court
in a dusty room i come to assume
that i’ve been doomed
to lose my mind tonight
too weak to fight
so i try to save face and i rest my case
the judge pulls me aside , says , “c’est la vie
let your darker side come out to feed”
shut up , shut up , shut up
sit up , sit up , sit up
it’s a kangaroo court
a kangaroo court
shut up , shut up , shut up
sit up , sit up , sit up
it’s a kangaroo court
a kangaroo court
“all rise...
you're kinda sexy”
i commit the crime of wasting time
always trying to rhyme
yes , i am guilty
but don’t misunderstand me
i admit defeat then i move my feet
my history will never be repeated
i won’t ever be repeated
shut up , shut up , shut up
sit up , sit up , sit up
it’s a kangaroo court
a kangaroo court
shut up , shut up , shut up
sit up , sit up , sit up
it’s a kangaroo court
a kangaroo court
