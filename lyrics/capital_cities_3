i got something on my mind
but words , they won't do it justice
i could write it on a sign
but words , they won't do it justice
i need a translator at the tip of my tongue
there's a freight train of emotion stuck in my lung
i need to get it out , get it out before it's all gone
so i'll just speak in vowels from now on
a - a
o - o
e - e
ooh - ooh - ooh
a - a
o - o
e - e
ooh - ooh - ooh
i could tell you what it's like
but words , they won't do it justice
spell it out , turn up the mic
but words , they won't do it justice
i need a psychic to read my mind
get me a shakespeare to feed me lines
i need to let it out , let it out , i waited too long
i'm only using vowels from now on
a - a
o - o
e - e
ooh - ooh - ooh
a - a

ooh - ooh - ooh
ahh - ahh - ahh
ahh - ahh - ahh
