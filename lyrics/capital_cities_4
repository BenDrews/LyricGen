origami ( or or or ri o , or ri )
you got a head full of paper
but baby nothing like origami
shredded thoughts and make up
won't make up for the missing piece of mind
i saw you look in the mirror
the scenery was suddenly boring
it's the end of an era
forever is just a state of mind
you're last of your kind
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you going to do
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you going to do about it , do about it
you were blessed with precision
so i took you to the beaches of bali
it wasn't fate but decision
luck was choosing sides
flip the page to a silver age
life has treated you kindly
the price you pay is your vision
collision is highly likely
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you going to do
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you going to do about it , do about it
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you going to do
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you going to do about it , do about it
origami
origami
origami
origami
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you going to do
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you going to do about it , do about it
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you going to do
i stole your diamonds and gold
what are you going to do about it , do about it
