sold my bed
sold my , sold my
sold my bed
sold my...
black is my favorite color
makes me feel like we know each other
blank tapes and posters on the door
listen to my pink floyd cover
take a seat like a backseat lover
mixed tapes and cushions on the floor
i sold my bed , but not my stereo
i sold my bed , but not my stereo
sold my bed
sold my , sold my
paper bags and escalators
pushing up those broken faders
only way to find out who you are
in a town of ones and zeros
you are one magnetic hero
little things will always get you far
i sold my bed , but not my stereo
i sold my bed , but not my stereo
i sold my bed , but not my stereo ( sold my , sold my )
i sold my bed , but not my stereo
black is my favorite color
makes me feel like we know each other
in a town of ones and zeros
you are one magnetic hero
i sold my bed , but not my stereo
i sold my bed , but not my stereo ( sold my bed )
i sold my bed , but not my stereo ( sold my bed )
i sold my bed , but not my stereo
