we painted our faces
we were at resting place in from the light
i must admit on that resting site
we looked alright
but now it's just traces
as we fade in black and white
we put makeup on with no light
we're too uptight
color me this way
color me that way
color me inside out
color me upside down
color me this way
color me that way
color me inside out
color me upside down
to show my true colors
i must first be exposed to the light
i trust first and secondly fight
with all my might
i've blown my cover
in plain view i'm as plain as you
but you can't deny my hues
red blue chartreuse
color me this way
color me that way
color me inside out
color me upside down
color me this way
color me that way
color me inside out
color me upside down
color me this way
color me that way
color me inside out
color me upside down
