i want it all and nothing less
i want it all , i want the best for you
i'm telling you the truth
you are the one that makes it real
even the sunlight doesn't feel this good
whoever said it could ?
patience
patience gets us nowhere fast
patience
patience gets us nowhere fast
i want it all and nothing less
i want it all , i want the best for us
i'm telling you to trust
the world you see is on our side
take a chance and take a ride with me
from sea to shining sea
patience
patience gets us nowhere fast
patience
patience gets us nowhere fast
i don't want my patience to last
follow me , follow me somewhere
follow me , follow me somewhere
follow me , follow me somewhere out there
follow me , follow me somewhere
follow me , follow me somewhere
follow me , follow me somewhere out there
i want it all and nothing less
i want it all , i want the best for you
i'm telling you the truth
you are the kiss i don't expect
remind me never to forget my youth
i'll leave it up to you
patience
patience gets us nowhere fast
patience
patience gets us nowhere fast
patience
patience gets us nowhere fast
patience
patience gets us nowhere fast
