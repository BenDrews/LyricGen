love , just love away
just do it every day
just do it every way
love , just love away
just do it every day
just do it every way
all my friends , they pretend
the end is just around the bend
but since you came along
i'm not believing it
sunshine , destiny
the birds and bees and centipedes
until you came along
i never needed it
love , just love away
just do it every day
just do it every way
love , just love away
just do it every day
just do it every way
money , power , a man of means
chasing down irrational dreams
but when you came along
i was freed of it
throw your tv out the door
one , two , three , four , on the floor
and if you sing a song
you'll believe in it
love , just love away
just do it every day
just do it every way
love , just love away
just do it every day
just do it every way
love , just love away
just do it every day
just do it every way
love , just love away
just do it every day
just do it every way
love , just love away
just do it every day
just do it every way
love , just love away
just do it every day
just do it every way
