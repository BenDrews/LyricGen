sick and tired , and you wanna see a change
but you don't wanna change for me
be so kind to explain what's on your mind
you're the riddle of the century
i'm afraid there was a lion lying in the shade
on a hammock , hanging from my tree
lazy lies today ( lazy lies today )
lazy lies today ( lazy lies today )
tomorrow you might change
but it's lazy lies today ( lazy lies today )
lazy lies today ( lazy lies today )
tomorrow you might change
but lazy lies today
please explain what you think there is to gain
when you treat me like a magazine
just a picture , i'm a temporary fixture
like a moment in your make believe
my prediction , strange as fiction
i'll get over this addiction too
lazy lies today ( lazy lies today )
lazy lies today ( lazy lies today )
tomorrow you might change
but it's lazy lies today ( lazy lies today )
lazy lies today ( lazy lies today )
tomorrow you might change
but lazy lies today
( lazy lies today , lazy lies today , lazy lies today )
( lazy lies today , lazy lies today , lazy lies today )
