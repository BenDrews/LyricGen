rip capital steelo
from mad mike
earthquake mad student
( verse 1 )
cut yo moms vagina off so i can fuck it in class when i'm bored
and say its the new fashion abroad
cos niggas is always on the internet but can never get there balls installed after i rip em
leave em bustin a void when a girl makes a moaning noise
a man grown to a boy when the pill is active in my blood stream
where little men fish for ass beating if they bait is heat to get my liquid boiled
i glue bones to soil with a chokeslam to prove i'm the undertaker
groundshaker crane imitater
bring the whole package to the consumer
consume ya with all kinds of toppings
ecspecially a nuns tits cos the milk is still fresh and untouched
eat lunch if a advertising specialist shows up
for the commercial break
earthquake a crack to fall in to meet my henchman called the d man
while i bbm jack the ripper and send him photos of hoes we can manipulated
get brain forcefully to increase suspicion
of the bigfoot suddenly travel to brazil
cos i have body organs squeezed in four holsters
my ryhme sound like 7 horns acknowledging my antichrist persona
in the biblical manner
niggas die for bitches and the manna
i get bread every morning with tea bags
and optical bags cos i'm a visionary tripper
preaching on the concrete jungle revealing where potholes should be if rain starts to exist in this drought where i have no effect to economy detest deutronomy with my white flows like the pope's robe
cos i'm the highness like inhaling what a mastercard catered for
lyricist not rapper with metaphors and wheel clampers
to stop your heart from running get tumbling off rock and crash on a water bed
hopefully you'd. back stroke and not be dead
yo dad shoulda jacked off to a wall insteada raising a faggot
lock yourself in the closet when your an infant and let loose when you grow a beard
to be heard like i am
i acknowledgement the greatest of freedom
better do what i just said oh no oh shit
your too grown for this
black and white like zebras
tiger in the forest i roam with cheetas
but still a smart head that roams with lion coats
use they tails as my country's flag and i attract danger when i break the ground with lyrical exposure
i wrote this ryhme with composure
when i transmitted my physical exposure in the mind of a cursed boulder
heart as rock steel bring crack to your shoulder
for upliftment
and straight posture of your physical aroma
got you deep but i plainly wrote these elevating lines cos i was
outta paper and had to go 300 on the piece of paper
like chief keef or an arabian raper
stuck in bagdad where homo's is fed cement
not see men for a year
as they get hard and wank eachother off
and swim like they hasslehoff
i'm the crook you couldn't hassle off
i let a lady do it
and start a campaign to slay off any cranium wrestled by homosexual visuals
i'm the lyrical missile that hitler woulda
used on a speech to alienate the human race to preach equally
and tear up the speech after the chatter of a hobo
i'm a clean hobo but the mind i couldn't dust it quick
get foam in your ears
and get glue as your tears so they
detergent doesn't penetrate through your material
cos they brainwash easily
like washing machines
telling us to stop the greenery
well i rap to every industry
i smoke like an industry
when i assemble my machinery
i've got bars for prison and furnaces
i bring the heat where your furnace is
they warming up i'm already ready
serve me to the rappers that bite lines
so i jump to they nose just to prove that i'm really dope
till you get inspired by my fire and
twitch shoulders like scarface
with a watery nose like escobar
when i spit a bar like the chocolate was aight
i'm unsigned but assigned to kill these diapers wrapped pieces of shit
out they holy temple
with a baptizing rainfall
i serve the third eye visuals you need a budha to tape this
not racist but annoyed on how ancestors was fed like boys
and treated with hooks
on a track if they dropped the crack
i explode minds that lack expansion
like a bomb in the sea
hoping you see the spark in you and me
a bulb is superstition
skulls burnt it needs super stitching
like the condition of michael jackson
he was screwed not disrespect to the jacksons
rip to capital steez why the spit that was ugly and never handsome
they truth is alcohol with hurts
with a bitter taste
so listen what i say with a bit of
acquired tuition
wear these tores vans how you step
in my position
and understand that my restriction is loose and might end up with addiction
get elevated like fiction
when friction is passed out a directors mouth screaming to start the violence
to your own human inserted in a vessels of emotions
i smell a fart and a turtle neck when
i step in the deck
about to sink ships
with mythical in parenthesis
to emphasize the stupidness of
your thesis
its a cock and bullstory which amounts to a hole lotta faeces
hook... ( this for my nigga called capo , capo , capo , capital steez
capo , capo , capo , to the steelo )
( verse 2 )
when i write with a steelo
i grab souls out torso
as heads nod in dojo
in recognition
of my martial as i rip wigs off
with cotton soaked in the skin sowed
feel my metabolism speed up as i can eat mc's fast and still crave a burger
with toppings of samoosa
when i rampage in mental disorder
cos my brains on the couch watching reality shows
so i live in a fantasy where reality doesn't show
till you get close to the light source
not a tv fool
i'm just saying greenery in a complex
way to duplex your mind for expansion after the slams friction so stop bitching
and open up it only hurts a little
when i tickle with my pickle
then let loose a testicles flood
your flows is little it just tickles the mud
i bring turbulence in a lake
i'm the shark in a pond
