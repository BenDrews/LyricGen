this one right here
1 & 9
hate to see my brothers minds go dimes blow
shines glow
no swine no pork
si ny
gainsborough
every thought
streets talk
beats talk
east court
night cellular
million dollar selling
i score cheddar up
hard work betta us
i speak facts
homies you cheap acts
nigga i’m g cats cars , money , microphones
hundreds i keep that
holding my fort down
my fort sports that east pack
allow meats
nigga we eat that
study work hard make it out
then we reach back
monumental love
continental wishes
making death wishes
hood niggas roll out
dimes and ghetto bitches
drug money riches
that had good niggas be snitches
now wait a minute
it could never be finished
i been in it since the beginning
x amount of free pussy
free weed , free bombs , free business
for all the hell we been through
nigga this is for the sinners
it’s my word
me and shaeine an dem
everybody do what they do
let’s take money , take paper man
shine on , shine on
it don’t even matter yo
we up the ladder on the reservation man
this is how we do
shine talk , new talk , new walk
what you goin do nigga
this is how we off the boardwalk
all of ma niggas that getting that paper
keep getting that paper
hold up , hold up
i got something to say
something to spray
games on if you get in my way
black gloves in the back
with the 9 in the tray
pow
lay you down
all you hear is the sound
see the guard , see the tassle
yeah i’m sporting a crown
look around at my cypher
get torched around
unique
i’m one different from the rest
spitting with the tech
blood leaking from your chest ( let’s go )
surely ain’t one to test
i rest
you at peace
leave a crease in the beat
sum’in for the street
knowledge on
you know the theme of this song
real minds
i talk mines
that’s how we all stand strong
you put in the couch
i got better plans
but i gotta watch my back
for black vans and pelligrins
half chance to get it ram
past friends
and the white chicks
still saving the last dance
two steps ahead of you
ready for all the drama
of yo’ medical marijuana
i’m shredding you in the biz
on some presidential shit
crash surrender will show you the meaning
of what reckless is
you can’t do it all on your own
you got a betta chance
ryna to pull a sword out of stone
you got a betta chance
stocking goods to board up your home
cause i’m callin it home
and blow up the mall with a drone
of cause in the zone
wildin’ like im violent in a foster home
toss your bones in a bottomless pit
or for them organ donors
offer loan your heart is stone
starting over in some parts unknown
that will rip you apart
swim the sharks and get your cartilage torn
i’m like a new baby guerilla
that’s born in the wild
brains spillin on the 5th
got you snorting on tile
trained killer
got a few in the coroner’s now
easy to kill
and got me bent
when i’m recording my sound
yeah , i’m from the borough of shaolin
where the thoroughest niggas is found in
empty the clip
throw another round in
then jump in the black benz with surround sound in
my flows so deep niggas could drown in it
adjacent to crystal lake
and sticking them clowns in it
get stripped down in it
exchange shots if you down with in
got the bank with the mounts in it
five grand , this is my last roll
then imma bounce , dig it
platinum bridge in his mouth
with diamonds mount in it
cause i shoot bullets you can’t block
like adrian peterson
you don’t wanna see shae on these streets again
cause the sk sleep again
gotta call in da and police again
i got too many guns for one person
main street or back block
catch it my gun’s bursting
you can catch me
smack dab on the strip
guns like calisthenics
burn your abs with the fifths
so everytime you see me
the big mags on my hip
fully loaded clips
for all you fags on my dick
and i shoot it sideways
like bruce willis on his last flick
so move easy
you won’t last in the streets
and when it get cold
i turn it up
with the flash from the heat
low bass settle deep
so go ahead and play with it
turn your face into tomato sauce
when the tray hit it
