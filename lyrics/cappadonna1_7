tell mel shawn to come in
word , yo , one life to live
it's on your head
just like my daughters
that's my word !
polka dot
connection
shine just apostle
yo , my whole body like a spoiler kid , draped in the latest hits
both hands , two glass cutters , cops'll alter this
cream of wheat steez pushed back , we in a spaceship
like the jetsons , ashtray slide refreshments
automatic bubble yo , straight off the benz
dac double daniel unrockable fam milk the same yo
fuck you , duel of the iron , tony win a oscar
legendary rah , wicked phantom of the opera
blow fish the movie's over , die with a slow kiss
tongue kiss the neck and it's , mucus from a locust
stand on fly , mel - a - chi is on standby
the y chormosome with the x that multiplies , yo
word on block is that half the king killer beez
rap's under seige , guyanese guns
i got european funds , my ice don't melt
shaolin is felt , mathematics is my rod
and my staff , i pray like this
i break mics in half , shit realism
fuck moet and baguettes , that get paid off
or get laid off , i spray new york
i'm an angel , at war with the rappers
good black women sleep over at cappa's
i fall into it , mr. september
rock my long fubu shirt in the winter
i respect my kind , plus pack a nine
daytime outfit superb outlet
staten isle in effect , y'all in the manor
if you can feel don down it atlanta
i'm a poet , my work is never done
law of park hill , my mic is stage one
fifty - five tribes , in psalms 30
caution , sometimes my thoughts get dirty
somethin precise , hold back the pressure
my unit too nice , you only got one life
to live , think twice
( think twice think twice twice twice twice )
yo , aiyyo we swindle , make moves , pj out the window
flamingo , santa domingo , let's kringle
bruce wayne diggin graveyard rocks and swingin
multimillions , rap pavillion stay g'in
this year , we throw darts in the air
to let y'all know this shit is severe
ohhhhhhh donnn - na , ohhhhhhh donnn - na
dove nice mary jane bitches bud light
co - production i spoke to christ , shoes were light
statueheads all up in my lab like mad
empty bags are lyin in the yard , welfare
dead weight yo , cables that clamp around the neck
sucrets fast corvettes , tecs on my rest
sabotage , rap motor large , mickey caught a charge
credit card scam , when he couldn't rock the wu skull

big ghost'll grab the jim and un - fasten your box'
you're allergic to the fungus on earth , killer bee
headquarters is work , khadafi body in his turf

soundin like me , suckin my dick
pretty tone , long live the great cappadon
cappadon...
... as i get it on
i'mma take time to wait for y'all niggas to stop
it ain't enough room for y'all cats to sound chop
in a class by myself i hold the foundation
face to face , i make my affiliation
short and brief , i make out with the looseleaf
in the struggle , ten years after the beef
i choose to come forth then pronounce my sin
if it's not the felonies or the color of my skin
i'mma keep switchin my gear , again and again
from the trainin camp i drive past v.i.n
it be wu - wear for life , my team is top billin
more sacrifices , create better livin
my darts came to save the world like blue ribbon
protect seeds , and protect black women
raised in the pillage right now we just driftin
ferry boat niggas make a whole lotta difference
drama , if you slackin up in the business
godly from the group home always got biscuits
ohhhhhhh , donnn - na ( repeat 4x )
" a killer should not be known , he must be discrete - understand ? "
