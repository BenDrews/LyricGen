i know a lot of brothers that think that they can flow
but when i come through , it's like everybody's slow
one kid told me he used to be a pro
until he bump heads with new cappachino
you might of seen my face in the old school arena
dipped like a fresh kid sipping on pina
i'm a felony , y'all cats a misdemeanor
eyeballing , all on my dick like gina
smiling , you're not really ready for the whylin'
came up strong but you scared of staten island
all on my chest , oh the big fat medallion
what you don't really want this here rut
rhyme prostitute , rhyme slut
battle wit dancehall king , you get struck by the lightning
i tear mics up , y'all need to quit
the name of this rhyme is i splashed the shit
some of y'all sing like never before
i sleep all day while y'all trying to score
then i wake up like alien 3
coming at y'all niggas that stole the rhymes from me
bitch , this is how the poor got rich
lay on the track then insert the hit
nine months later , the rap world is pregnant
wu babies blow kid , beware the segment
rumor has it , donna darts create magic
nobody in my team have it
you've seen my face on a $20 dollar bill
then you hear my voice on an iron man reel
it's all tragic , rule not the bull shit - atrics
your rap is swine , mines is like catfish
birthday rap style , come on make a wish
