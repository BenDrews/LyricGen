oh , my love , my darling
i've hungered for your touch , a long lonely time
and time goes by , so slowly and time can do so much
are you , still mine ?
i need your love , i need your love
godspeed your love to me
lonely rivers flow to the sea , to the sea
to the waiting arms of the sea
lonely rivers cry , wait for me , wait for me
to the open arms , wait for me
my love , my darling , i've hungered for your kiss
are you still mine ?
i need your love , i need your love
godspeed your love , to me
