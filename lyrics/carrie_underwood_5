i love it when we're at a party in a downtown crowd
oh but i can't hear you call me baby with the music up loud
red wine , good times , no i don't mind being with everyone else
and then there's nights like tonight that i , i want you to myself
and tonight i wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
and we can't see those city lights and i love the way you look in a firefly glow
saying everything without making a sound
a cricket choir in the background , underneath a harvest moon
standing on your shoes in my bare feet
dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
oh woah , and we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
i wanna feel it like a kick drum , beating faster in your chest
i wanna feel you holding onto me and make me hold my breath
you pull me closer , my head on your shoulder , baby we won't need a song
we'll make a fallen star wish , one more slow kiss , what are we waiting on ?
and tonight i wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
and we can't see those city lights and i love the way you look in a firefly glow
saying everything without making a sound
a cricket choir in the background , underneath a harvest moon
standing on your shoes in my bare feet
dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
yeah , we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
i wanna feel it like a kick drum , beating faster in your chest
and tonight i wanna drive so far we'll only find static on the radio
and we can't see those city lights and i love the way you look in a firefly glow
saying everything without making a sound , with the
river rolling in the background , underneath a harvest moon
standing on your shoes in my bare feet
dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
we're dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
