jenny grew up wild , like a blackfoot daisy
out in the shack with a blue tick hound
broke as hell , but blessed with beauty
the kind that a rich man can't turn down
she caught the eye of an oil man dancing
one summer night in a dime store dress
she had the looks , he had the mansion
and you can figure out the rest
it was all roses , dripping in diamonds
sipping on champagne
she was all uptown , wearing that white gown
taking his last name
she could hear those church bells ringing , ringing
and up in the loft , that whole choir singing , singing
fold your hands and close your eyes
yeah , it's all gonna be alright
and just listen to the church bells ringing , ringing
yeah , they're ringing
jenny was hosting junior league parties
and having dinner at the country club
everyone thought they were ken and barbie
but ken was always getting way too drunk
saturday night , after a few too many
he came home ready to fight
and all his money could never save jenny
from the devil living in his eyes
it was all bruises , covered in makeup
dark sunglasses
and that next morning , sitting in the back pew
praying with the baptist
she could hear those church bells ringing , ringing
and up in the loft , that whole choir singing , singing
fold your hands and close your eyes
yeah , it's all gonna be alright
you just listen to the church bells ringing , ringing
yeah , they're ringing
jenny slipped something in his tennessee whiskey
no law man was ever gonna find
and how he died is still a mystery
but he hit a woman for the very last time
she could hear those church bells ringing , ringing
standing there in a black dress singing , singing
fold your hands and close your eyes
yeah , it's all gonna be alright
and just listen to the church bells ringing , ringing
yeah , they're ringing
