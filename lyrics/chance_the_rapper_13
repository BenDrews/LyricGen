{transition from " pusha man " to " paranoia " }
i've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind , got my mind on the fritz
but a lot of niggas dyin' , so my 9 with the shits
i've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind , got my mind on the fritz
but a lot of niggas dyin' , so my 9 with the shits
move to the neighborhood ; i bet they don't stay for good , watch
somebody'll steal daddy's rollie , call it the neighborhood watch
pray for a safer hood when my paper good , watch
captain save - a - hood , hood savior , baby boy
still getting id'd for swishers ( mama still wash my clothes )
still with the save money militia ( i'mma still watch my bros )
trapped in the middle of the map with a little - bitty rock and a little bit of rap
that , with a literary knack , and a little shitty mac , and like literally jack
i've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind , got my mind on the fritz
but a lot of niggas dyin' , so my 9 with the shits
i've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind , got my mind on the fritz
but a lot of niggas dyin' , so my 9 with the shits
they murking kids , they murder kids here
why you think they don't talk about it ? they deserted us here
where the fuck is matt lauer at ? somebody get katie couric in here
probably scared of all the refugees , look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
they'll be shooting whether it's dark or not , i mean , the days is pretty dark a lot
down here , it's easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot
no love for the opposition , specifically a cop position
'cause they've never been in our position
getting violations for the nation , correlating , you dry snitchin'
i've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
with the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
paranoia on my mind , got my mind on the fritz
but a lot of niggas dyin' , so my 9 with the shits
i know you scared
you should ask us if we scared too
i know you scared
me too
i know you scared
you should ask us if we scared too
if you was there
then we'd just knew you cared too
it just got warm out , this the shit i've been warned 'bout
i hope that it storm in the mornin' , i hope that it's pourin' out
i hate crowded beaches , i hate the sound of fireworks
and i ponder what's worse between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'cause everybody dies in the summer
wanna say your goodbyes , tell them while it's spring
i heard everybody's dying in the summer
so pray to god for a little more spring
i know you scared
you should ask us if we scared too
if you was there
then we'd just knew you cared too
