let's get lost , let's get lost
i blessed myself inside your arms one day
swear to god there i was when the dress
and the silver buttons fade away
miss mary mattress , geriatrics
fuck me into open caskets , i wanna die with this
i wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
she said " pill pop , baby girl 'cause i promise you , you tweaked
the empty bottled loneliness , this happiness you seek "
the masochism that you preach
practice back flips , tragic actress
on a movie with no screen
when the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams
my druggy
when i'm ugly
hug me
when i'm bummy , scummy
i'm your hubby
let's get lost , let's get lost
igh !
