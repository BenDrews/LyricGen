even better than i was the last time baby
ooh ooh ooh ooh
( yo , we back )
i'm good , ooh , yeah , i'm good
even better than i was the last time baby
ooh ooh ooh ooh , i'm good
( we back and we back and we back )
so good...
( and we back and we back and we back and we back )
even better than i was the last time
rap just make me anxious , and acid made me crazy
them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
and i still make this song , and i'mma make another
if you ever actually hit me , better watch out for my brother
better bet i'd take that deal , gotta watch out for my mother
get a watch with all that glitters , come in clutters , different colors
ben - a - baller , benford , butlers , chauffeurs , hit a stain - er , did i stutter ?
did a ton of drugs and did better than all my alma mater
motherfucker money dance , hundreds zan , gallon lean
make a joke 'bout leno's hair then piggy back on fallon's spleen
balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
nightly searches for a bed and i just came off tour with troy
but i can't complain , i got some motherfucking bitches
how many lab partners have i fucked since i got suspended ?
mr. bennett , you done did it , you did it , you did it
you did a good ass job , you did a good ass job
and i'm good
even better than i was the last time baby
ooh ooh ooh ooh , i'm good
i'm good , so good...
even better than i was the last time baby
ooh ooh ooh ooh
i'm good ( even better than i was the last time )
so good...
work , work , work , work , bang nigga , bang
twerk , twerk , merge , swerve , dang , pick a lane
flip a bird ; pigeon , plane , it's a word , it's a shame
but god i'm good , swear i couldnâ€™t be better
kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
keep a tab on my exes , keep some " x " on my tongue
keep my work out in texas , that's just me flexing my lungs
see them showing they teeth , that's just them flapping they gums
if they bite and i'm snapping , clap clap collapsing they lungs
call me chancelor the rapper , please say " the rapper "
magical word ( poof ) , please say 'kadabra
replay the replays ; green bay , the packers
cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
matches to gas leaks , dusted dusk 'til dawn
it's just us , and trust ya bottom , bitch , my stuff the fucking bomb
i'm the motherfucking fucker , fuck a niggas fucking dumb
this your favorite fucking album , i ain't even fucking done
i'm good ! igh !
ooh ooh ooh ooh , i'm good
ooh , yeah , i'm good , so good ( i'm good , i'm good )
even better than i was the last time baby
ooh ooh ooh ooh
( i'm better than the last time , yeah , yeah )
i'm good ( i'm gonna be )
so good...
even better than i was , even better than i was
( i'm gonna be so good... )
even better than i was
( ooh , i'm gonna be , i'm gonna be )
even better than i was , even better than i was
( i'm gonna be so good... )
even better than i was ( so good , so good , so good , yeah
i'm gonna be , i'm gonna be
i'm gonna be so good... )
