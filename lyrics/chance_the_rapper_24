this ain't no intro , this the entree
hit that intro with kanye and sound like andré
tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
she like music , she from houston like auntie yoncé
man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
if she ever find another , he better love her
man i swear my life is perfect , i could merch it
if i die i'll prolly cry at my own service , igh , igh !
it was a dream , you could not mess with the beam
this is like this many rings
y'all know wha' mean ?
this for the kids of the king of all kings
this is the holiest thing
this is the beat that played under the word
this is the sheep that ain't like what it herd
this is officially first
this is the third
this is the bom bom bom

music is all we got
so we might as well give it all we got
this is the bom bom bom

so we might as well give it all we got
i get my word from the sermon
i do not talk to the serpent
that's the holistic discernment
daddy said i'm so determined
told me these goofies can't hurt me
i just might make me some earl tea
i was baptized like real early
i might give satan a swirlie
wish i could tell you it's ready
tell you it's ready today
they don't give nothing away
you gotta fight for your way
and that don't take nothing away
cause at the end of the day
music is all we got
music is all we got
isn't this all we got ?
so we might as well give it all we got
music is all we got
music is all we got
we know , we know we got it
we know , we know we got it
we know , we know we got it
we know , we know we got it
