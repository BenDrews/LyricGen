we used to roll at the rink , we used to roll at the rink
i used to talk way too much , you used to know everything
you couldn't stand me , i couldn't stand you
you said i'm steady playin' , but you steady playin' too
your big brother foot work
your play sister juke
the rink was the place
but in that space and time i was too young for you
as you were for me , too worried 'bout frooties and chews
'til i found out all the shawdy's with cooties was cute
and realized what booties can do
we gon' get it poppin'
we gon' get it jukin'
we gon' throw a party
we ain't gotta do shit
you came with your best friend
came up with for the weekend
rolling with your parties
so tell me what you thinkin'
so we gon' have a juke jam
so we gon' have a juke jam
we can have a party , just listening to music
like we used to do
i'll get close to you
i remember you
you used to " i remember you "
we've got so much history baby , maybe
maybe you and i were meant to be
maybe i'm crazy
we never rolled at the rink
we would just go to the rink
you ain't buy tokens no more
you just hip roll at the rink
you had a nigga , i couldn't stand him
but when they play " take you down " , chris brown
i am his stand - in
i mean it's just dancing
it's harmless as fuck
then i put my waist through your hips
and your legs and my arms just to harness you up
then we hit the floor
all the kiddies stop skating
to see grown folks do , what grown folks do
when they grown and they dating
we've got so much history baby , maybe
maybe you and i were meant to be
maybe i'm crazy
crazy about you
we gon' get it poppin'
we gon' get it jukin'
we gon' throw a party
we ain't gotta do shit
you came with your best friend
who came up for the weekend
rollin with the parties
so tell me what you thinkin'
so we gon' have a juke jam
so we gon' have a juke jam
we can have a party , just listening to music
like we used to do
i'll get close to you
i remember you
you used to " i remember you "
we've got so much history baby ( juke )
maybe ( juke )
