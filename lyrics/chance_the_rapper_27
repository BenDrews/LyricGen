i speak of promised lands
soil as soft as momma's hands
running water , standing still
endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
rice under black beans
walked into apple with cracked screens
and told prophetic stories of freedom
found warmth in a black queen for when i get cold
like nat king , i'm doing the dad thing
i speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood
make you remember how to smile good
i'm pre - currency , post - language , anti - label
pro - famous , i'm broadway joe namath
kanye's best prodigy
he ain't signed me but he proud of me
i got some ideas that you gotta see
make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the odyssey
they never seen a rapper practice modesty
i never practice , i only perform
i don't even warn , i don't eat it warm , i won't be reborn
i speak to god in public , i speak to god in public
he keep my rhymes in couplets
he think the new shit jam , i think we mutual fans
i used to dance to michael , i used to dance in high school
i used to pass out music , i still pass out music
the people's champ must be everything the people can't be
i'm getting artsy - fartsy , house full of some hebru brantleys
you mustâ€™ve missed the come up , i must be all i can be
call me mister mufasa , i had to master stampedes
i made it through , made it through , made it through
and everything i gave to you , i gave to you , i gave to you
you got it , you got it , you got it , it's coming ( coming , coming , coming )
