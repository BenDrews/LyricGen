truth being told , we used to movies and bowl
we used to netflix and roll
i used to pass her the smoke
she used to laugh at my jokes
you pat my back when i choke
wish we were stuck in our ways
we way too young to get old
we stuck together like oowops
we smoke to fetty , sing zoowap

i gave her percs for myself
i give her a perc for esteem
i'm tryna crown me a queen
you hear the chains when they cling
i take the molly its clean
i push the whip with the wings
i gotta be overseas
i gotta be on the pedal
i push it down to the floor
i got designer galore
i keep some goyard and gars

you smell the smoke in the seats
