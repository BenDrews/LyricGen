what's better than tripping is falling in love
what's better than letterman , leno , fallon , and all the above
what's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
is the first caveman pops with his son , ball and a club
what's better than paper is ballin' it up
what's better than followers is actually fallin' in love
what's better than frolicking , follies , fallin' in mud
rolling in green pastures , wanderin' , followin' love
what's better than eating is feeding your fam
what's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
what's better than leaning and needing a xan
is hitting your zan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
what's better than yelling is hollerin' love
what's better than rhymes , nickels , dimes and dollars and dubs
is dialing up your darling just for callin' her up
it ain't nothing better than fallin' in love
igh !
i've seen it come back , back , back and forth
