here’s a tab of acid for your ear
you’re the plastic , i’m the passion and the magic in the air
the flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
the labyrinth of pan’s lab is adamantly here
no assignments , book of rhyming and i’m drawing doodles
i should rhyme rhyme with ramen noodles
ramadan , i’m the don of the diamond jewels
fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
i’m a kamikaze and i’m a kinda cuckoo
i could write a fucking book , non kamasutral
you niggas goofies , it's a conflict that is kinda crucial
caught you on the 9 in all blue yelling i’m a neutral
but i’ma let the bull pass like matadors
versus a minotaur , verse is a metaphor
metamorphoses and i’ma fuckin animorph
i used to go to school with anna fedele & danny whorf
remember i used to bang with the bad ones
'til my grandmama told on her grandson
mama said that i was way too handsome
to be throwing the hand’s son , breaking walls like samson
but i’ma throw a tantrum 'til i’m on every samsung
sanyo and handheld and handgun
please put ya lighter’s up 'til life is up and light it up
and slice a cut , the night is young , it’s nice enough
the nicest blunt , the nicest stuff
my niggas out here trapping a lot
i know you think you on , hiding reggie sacks in your socks
i hang with niggas , whole jab in the jock
.4’s for 15 , yeah my nigga , we be taxing a lot
only the goofies though , choking on a doobie though
my eyes do be low , two be rolled , remember days of the rufio
remember the days of chan - man and the skeeter man
brrang dang to lil' b and bang a - rang to peter pan
igh ! nigga
i burned , i , i bu - , i bu - , i burned
i burned , i , i , i burned
br - br - br , hahahah
i burned too many brain cells down
to be worried bout my brain cells now , nigga
i burned too many brain cells down
to be worried bout my brain cells now , now now now
i burned too many brain cells down
to be worried bout my brain cells now , igh !
i burned too many brain cells down
down down down down down
light a joint , or spliff it if you classy
split a swisha witcha nigga if you ask me
ain’t no questions hit it vividly and pass me
don’t answer about your problems
or your issues or your ashleys
it’s a quarter to imminent , ten minutes to infinite
rims , henny , and reminisce , nostalgia and m&m's
cinnamon tone women and feminine’s getting intimate
all broads is frivolous , homies could get they dividends
is he illiterate , literal syndicate
illegitimate , idiot , gangbanger affiliate
sick twisted prick , sick sadistic
son of a biscuit , man fuck this shit
igh ! i burned too many brain cells down
i burned , i burned , hahah
i burned too many brain cells down
burned too many brain cells down , sing it with me
i burned too many brain cells down
to be worried bout my brain cells now
