charlie bartlett , john bender
class switcher , time bender
chance bennett , a peculiar name
graduation night teachers ferris bueller'd my name
you made a mixtape ? good job , i hope you get a good job
we was all outcasts , only listened to good mob
i performed at fun fair , fun fact
i'm never going back to school , been there , done that
they see my little 10 day tape and my dumb raps
don't call it impossible , if you really want that
they send my ass to summer school , don't call it a comeback
i just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back
chano y tequila you know you know you don't want that
i rap my songs in spanglish , i wrap my weed in blunt wraps
wrapped up in this one line i hope that shit get unwrapped
as if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap
yo vic , remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping ?
now i ain't gonna be a freshman and i'm rapping
i should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening
i just look over to justin for refreshments of the captain
it's sipping when it's weak sauce , it's shots if it's cracking
sip it when we tear up , and chug it if we laughing
fuck it if we're fucked up i never thought of chatham
until the day they said i would have to chat without em
and i'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right
here's a brighter bulb for your limelight
and this is your night , homie , shine bright
this for everybody's fucking prom night
and it's alright , and it's okay
and we're all good , we're with homies
any problems , you can call us
it's all love , it's all love
and it's alright , and it's okay
and we're all good , we're with homies

it's all love , it's all love
uh , yo this prom shit feel like the grammy's yo
these pictures granny took gonna make me ask where'd granny go
so pass the sanyo to auntie jo
and snap a couple candid's of the family , get some cameos
you can change the clocks but you can't change hours
i'm waiting on the day , spring can't bring flowers
let me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours
and pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers
and hop up in that limo , the hood going dummy
the hood fucking love me , the hood think we lovely
so go and pop some bubbly , this right here's to loyalty
this to a moment's glimpse at royalty
this is for my momma jan who spoiled me
look what we've accomplished
time flies , watches look like magnets on a compass
before we dip , gladys said a prayer over the limo
bumping 10 day with the angels with jesus shopping my demo
and rode up out of chatham , the whole hood clapping
and damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened
but it didn't , i missed prom , i missed it to spin
i did a show at akin and i would do it again
and it's alright , and it's okay
and we're all good , we're with homies
any problems , you can call us
it's all love , it's all love
and it's alright , and it's okay
and we're all good , we're with homies
any problems , you can call us
it's all love , it's all love
look at , look at your business tux , all night airplane
go and get your racist on , all white everything
i'm on my paper now , put that on my heading
i ain't even write this down i don't write errthing
i know y'all don't like everything
she want a night she can call her wedding
giving eskimo kisses , with some eskimo bitches
nose diving , going all night sledding
coked out like " don't change when you grow up
i hope you get some change when you blow up "
cause honestly i've always loved the way that you could throw up
rest up on my shoulder , float up flying lotus
" you deserve a warm towel , you deserve a soda
you deserve a quiet room , you deserve a sofa
you deserve a ferrari and a matching tiara
and a hand to wipe away all that running mascara "
but i , i want to thank you for this prom night
thank you for this prom night
thank you for this prom night
i really enjoyed my prom night
and it's alright , and it's okay
and we're all good , we're with homies
any problems , you can call us
it's all love , it's all love
