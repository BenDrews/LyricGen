i'm gon' praise him , praise him 'til i'm gone
i'm gon' praise him , praise him 'til i'm gone
when the praises go up , the blessings come down
when the praises go up , the blessings come down
it seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
it seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
i don't make songs for free , i make 'em for freedom
don't believe in kings , believe in the kingdom
chisel me into stone , prayer whistle me into song air
dying laughing with krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
jesus' black life ain't matter , i know i talked to his daddy
said you the man of the house now , look out for your family
he has ordered my steps , gave me a sword with a crest
and gave donnie a trumpet in case i get shortness of breath
i'm gon' praise him , praise him 'til i'm gone
don't be mad
i'm gon' praise him , praise him 'til i'm gone
when the praises go up
( good god )
the blessings come down
good god
when the praises go up ( good god ) the blessings come down
( the blessings come down )
when the praises go up , the blessings come down
( it seems like blessings keep falling in my lap )
the blessings come down
when the praises go up , the blessings come down
( good god )
they booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
with the big wide windows , with the suicide doors
ain't no blood on my money , ain't no twitter in heaven
i know them drugs isn't close , ain't no visitin' heaven
i know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
like my ex girl getting pregnant
and her becoming my everything
i'm at war with my wrongs , i'm writing four different songs
i never forged it or forfeited , i'm a force to be reconciled
they want four minute songs
you need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
i'm feeling shortness of breath , so nico grab you a horn
hit jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water , ugh !
( good god )
i'm gon' praise him , praise him till i'm gone
( good god )
i'm gon' praise him , praise him till i'm gone
when the praises go up , ( good god ) the blessings come down
( the blessings come down )
when the praises go up , the blessings come down
( the blessings come down )
when the praises go up , the blessings come down
( are you ready for your blessings ? )
when the praises go up , the blessings come down
( are you ready for your miracle ? )
when the praises go up , the blessings come down
( are you ready , are you ready ? )
( are you ready , are you ready ? )
( are you ready , are you ready ? )
( are you ready , are you ready ? )
( are you ready , are you ready ? )
it seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
