we don't do the same drugs no more
we don't do the , we don't do the same drugs , do the same drugs no more
'cause she don't do the same drugs no more
we don't do the , we don't do the same drugs , do the same drugs no more
when did you change ?
wendy , you've aged
i thought you'd never grow up
i thought you'd never
window closed , wendy got old
i was too late , i was too late
a shadow of what i once was
'cause we don't do the same drugs no more
we don't do the , we don't do the same drugs , do the same drugs no more
she don't laugh the same way no more
we don't do the , we don't do the same drugs , do the same drugs no more
where did you go ?
why would you stay ?
you must have lost your marbles
you always were so forgetful
in a hurry , don't wait up
i was too late , i was too late
a shadow of what i once was
'cause we don't , we don't do what we say we're gonna
you were always perfect , and i was only practice
don't you miss the days , stranger ?
don't you miss the days ?
don't you miss the danger ?
we don't ( we don't ) do the same drugs no more ( do the same drugs no more )
we don't do the , we don't do the same drugs , do the same drugs no more
we don't ( we don't ) do the same drugs no more ( do the same drugs no more )
we don't do the , we don't do the same drugs , do the same drugs no more
we don't do the , we don't do the same drugs
( turn it around
i remember when
this age of pathetics )
don't forget the happy thoughts
all you need is happy thoughts
the past tense , past bed time
way back then when everything we read was real
and everything we said rhymed
wide eyed kids being kids
why did you stop ?
what did you do to your hair ?
where did you go to end up right back here ?
when did you start to forget how to fly ?
( it's so natural
just like juicy fruit
works like a magic trick
please give me half of that
we don't , we don't , we don't )
don't you color out
don't you bleed on out , oh
stay in the line , stay in the line
dandelion
( do the same drugs no more
we don't do the , we don't do the same drugs , do the same drugs no more
we don't , we don't , we don't.... )
don't you color out
don't you bleed on out , oh
stay in the line , stay in the line
dandelion
