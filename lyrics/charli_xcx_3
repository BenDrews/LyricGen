electric lights
blow my mind
i feel alright
never stop , it's how we ride
coming up until we die
you catch my eye
bitch , you wanna fly ?
i'm so alive
i don't wanna go to school
i just wanna break the rules
boys and girls across the world
putting on our dancing shoes
going to the discotheque
getting high and getting wrecked
i don't wanna go to school
i just wanna break the rules
i'm such a star
queen boulevard
blaze through the dark
get my guitar
sunglasses on
so light it up
na na na na na na na
