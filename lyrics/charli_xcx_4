all sticky down south , make it drip drop
i'm a hot shake when i strip off
got a lip kit , i ain't talkin' 'bout the lipgloss ( uh )
head down for the three way
pump a video when i got it on replay
can you make that ass go low ?
bring it right back real slow , uh
i'm licking that cake off my face
i know that you love how it tastes
so , bitch get me back that clean cut , yeah , yeah
they say i'm a slut , that's a compliment
and stealin' yo' girl's an accomplishment
take a boy , two at a time
