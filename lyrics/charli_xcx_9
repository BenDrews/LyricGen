yeah , we got a situation
locked down , and i'm trapped in the basement
i'm a victim of replacement
'cause you acting so leather
trying to put across your statement , oh
'cause i know you struggle
choke when you see love grow
you , you lied
ha - ha - ha - ha , i was right
all alone , good job , good job
you fucked it up
'cause we used to be the cool kids
you were old school , i was on the new shit
we were addicted to the blue print
but we threw it in the flame
and now we're never gonna trace it , oh

ha - ha - ha - ha , i was right
all alone , good job , good job
you fucked it up
and now you're walking on your own
the rain falls down , i'm not answering my phone
i got to phase you out my zone
hope you realize now that i am never coming home
you were meant to be alone
you , you lied
ha - ha - ha - ha , i was right
all alone , good job , good job
you fucked it up
it's a front
good job , good job
you fucked it up
( ha - ha - ha - ha - ha - ha )
