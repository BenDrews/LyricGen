let's marvin gaye and get it on
you got the healing that i want
just like they say it in the song
until the dawn , let's marvin gaye and get it on
we got this king - size to ourselves
don't have to share with no one else
don't keep your secrets to yourself
it's kama sutra show and tell , yeah
woah - oh - oh - oh
there's lovin' in your eyes that pulls me closer
it's so subtle , i'm in trouble
but i'd love to be in trouble with you
let's marvin gaye and get it on
you got the healing that i want
just like they say it in the song
until the dawn , let's marvin gaye and get it on
you've got to give it up to me
i'm screaming , " mercy , mercy , please ! "
just like they say it in the song
until the dawn , let's marvin gaye and get it on
and when you leave me all alone
i'm like a stray without a home
i'm like a dog without a bone
i just want you for my own
i got to have you , babe
woah - oh - oh - oh
there's lovin' in your eyes that pulls me closer
it's so subtle , i'm in trouble
but i'd rather be in trouble with you
let's marvin gaye and get it on
ooh , baby , i got that healing that you want , yes
like they say it in the songs
until the dawn , let's marvin gaye and get it on
let's marvin gaye and get it on
you got the healing that i want
just like they say it in the song
until the dawn , let's marvin gaye and get it on , babe
you've got to give it up to me
i'm screaming , " mercy , mercy , please ! "
just like they say it in the song
until the dawn , let's marvin gaye and get it on
just like they say it in the song
until the dawn , let's marvin gaye and get it on , ooh
