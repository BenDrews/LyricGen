this is gonna hurt but i blame myself first
cause i ignored the truth
drunk off that love , it fucked my head up
there’s no forgetting you
you’ve awoken me , but you’re choking me
i was so obsessed
gave you all of me , and now honestly , i got nothing left
i loved you dangerously
more than the air that i breathe
knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
didn’t care if the explosion ruined me
baby , i loved you dangerously
mmmm , mmmm
i loved you dangerously
usually , i hold the power
with both my hands tied behind my back
look at how things changed
cause now you’re the train and i’m tied to the track
you’ve awoken me , but you’re choking me
i was so obsessed
gave you all of me , and now honestly , i got nothing left
cause i loved you dangerously
more than the air that i breathe
knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
didn’t care if the explosion ruined me
baby , i loved you dangerously
you took me down , down , down , down
and kissed my lips with goodbye
i see it now , now , now , now
it was a matter of time
you know i know , there’s only one place this could lead
but you are the fire , i’m gasoline
i love you , i love you , i love you
i loved you dangerously
ooh , more than the air that i breathe
oh now , knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
didn’t care if the explosion ruined me
oh , oh baby , i loved you dangerously
mmmm , mmmm
ooh , i loved you dangerously
ooh ooh , i loved you dangerously
