tell me lies , like how you're better off without me
while the truth is written all over your face
even in photographs together you look lonely
when you were here , you never had to fake
and girl i promise i'm not gonna bother you anymore
soon as you hang up the phone
i just got one question that you might not be ready for
but i really gotta know
does it feel , feel like you never gon' find nothing better ?
does it feel , feel like you're missing , 'cause i loved you different ?
and the way that you can say you don't remember
how i kept you coming over every night
and the way that you can say you never wondered , wondered
if loving someone else is just a lie
woah , girl i promise i'm not gonna bother you anymore
soon as you hang up the phone
i just got one question that you might not be ready for
but i really gotta know
does it feel , feel like you never gon' find nothing better ?
does it feel , feel like you're missing , 'cause i loved you different ?
does it feel , feel like you never gon' find nothing better ?
does it feel , feel like you're missing , 'cause i loved you different ?
