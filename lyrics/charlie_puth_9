i'm run , yeah , oh yeah
i'm run , yeah like my mind
it's funny how i got just exactly what i want
i'll try to have fun some other time
i thought money was enough , it's just a temporary rush
i'll try to go find some other high
don't know why i wanna make it even harder
but i'm not the kind of man to take the easy road
so much to do and not enough time
not enough time , oh i got
so much to lose , i'm losing my mind
i'm losing my mind , oh my mind
i'm run , yeah , i'm run , yeah
i'm run , yeah like my mind
i'm sorry that i'm not there to give you what you want
i'll think about us some other time
and i'm sorry that i can't be the perfect type of man
i'll think about us some other time
don't know why i wanna make it even harder
i'm not the kind of man to take the easy road
i got so much to do and not enough time
not enough time , oh i got
so much to lose , i'm losing my mind
i'm losing my mind , oh my mind
nothing to lose , nothing to lose
i'm losing my mind , i'm losing my mind
nothing to lose , nothing to lose
i'm losing my mind , i'm losing my mind , oh my mind
i'm run , yeah , i'm run , yeah
i'm run , yeah like my mind
i'm run , yeah , i'm run , yeah
i'm run , yeah like my mind
