never change
it's a dirty game
but we still playing , predicting rain
we say fuck the weatherman cuz , we still shine
fuck what y'all sayin'
meetin deadlines
due date came i was prepared
i had my shit straight
we really be out there
rollin up getting paid
when you saw i was bossin' in the fast lane
when you saw me it was weeds of the finest strain
a couple niggas who done rolled with me through everything feel me mane
i think my city tryna kill me mane , but i love it
that's why i do so much for it
ferraris in storage , underground garages , and porsches
smoked out in my fortress
plottin on some more shit
restaurant early , i met the sexiest hostess
she liked my condo view so now she in my mirror posing
my newest muse baby girl i do this shit for you
ears open , eyes glued so she wet
i perfectly set the mood , way iller than dude
bitch you into mr. who's who
so many tycoons in one room
arm candy i brung dazzling 'em , unraveling some'n
thought they was tight , wrapped or somethin'
macking or somethin' , she'll take that lame game leave 'em with nothin'
come back to bed and play jenga with your stacks fool we hustling
fuck you thought , a real boss
niggas is lost
to us it's nothin'
to you it's somethin'
play jenga with your stacks fool we hustling
never change
it's a dirty game
but we still playing , forget the rain
we say fuck the weatherman cuz , we still shine
fuck what y'all sayin'
meet deadline
due date came , i was prepared
when you saw i was bossin' in the fast lane
