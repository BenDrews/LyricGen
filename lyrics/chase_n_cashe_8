( intro )
" and so my fellow americans
ask not what your country can do for you
ask what you can do for your country "
( verse 1 )
black man on a black path for green ,
red and blue on a stripped flag
in a white man's world , trying to get cash
where a wrong skin color can get you killed fast
or a wrong type of hustle get you jail time
can't hear from your fam' 'till it's mail time
niggers froze cause they're chilling on death row
what they did broke , what a whole more skid row
twenty twelve , but the shit been this way
poor getting poor , the rich win this way.
seeing it on me , know what's up
can't vote for obama if you don't show up
how you say you are a leader , but you won't teach
you ain't a real nigga cause you got one piece
you're greedy for success , but you don't work
i had to get it through the struggle , but it all hurt
see , i ain't did good and yes , i done dirt
had my head held high , put god first
team on my bay , bitch by my side
pistol in a bag anytime i got a riot
my ideal of fame got you ill in the brain
got to be the one , get you spilled on the pave'
meant to be a model , now you're laying in a grave
with a slogan on your tomb and the year you was made
it ain't no coming back from that
whatever they give us , you know they're coming back for that
cause it costs to live , even dying ain't cheap
so we're forced to live amongst the wild like beasts
in a foster room , with my hands on a weapon
the soe , cause i'm the man of protection
so fuck the police , they ain't gonna save you
only one that can is the man that made you.
before it's too late say a prayer to the savior
lord knows all the things i did for the paper
lord knows i just wanna bill for my people
weed in my brain , got a field full of evils
jealousy and envy , hateful from my friends
gotta get through the test , my best to make it in
so as the door open i just wanna make it in
to open windows for me and my camp folks
cause opportunity don't knock every day
a nine to five job , that's not steady pay
niggas on the block getting nots every day
and the only thing they're selling is some rocks made of yay
a lot up on my mind , not a lot up on my plate
starving to get a mil' , and striving to get away
to get a house on a hill , so i can go chill
what else can i do for my country , but stay real ?
