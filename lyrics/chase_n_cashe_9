cha - ching , look
look my money gettin' so long
i been spendin' time on that road
i been ridin' 'round and gettin' it
i'm grindin' all night long
i heard some people sayin' i'm on
they be playin' all of my songs
i shut it down when i perform
who is we ? sc , surf club
who is me ? mr. money
talkin' to me and i might decide to speak
lately i been goin' harder
i been drinkin' so much ace of spades , i'm gettin' flows like carter
which one , dwayne or shawn ? i'm hot like both
so the flame is on , you know i scorch that hoe
horsepower in my drive , i'll porsche that hoe
i need ferraris in my garage and mamis down to minage like nicki
only bad bitches , yeah i'm picky
i can see it in her eyes , inside she's sayin' pick me up
but i'm chosen , daytona is golden
rolex time , my flame could never be stolen
look , you niggas know i gave you the game
saw me go and do it first , now you changin' your lane
but no matter what you do , you'll always be a lame
bitch you know i'm 'bout them dollars 'cause it's all up in my name
all i do is get cash and get ass
all i do is get cash and get ass
all i do is
back to the subject at hand
baby i'm the flyest nigga walkin' on land
baby i'm the highest nigga to ever be grounded
anytime i lost some money it found me
you better than me ? my nigga how is you soundin'
style is profound and my mind is astoundin'
she wanted an inch , so i put a mile in
yes we gettin rich , you see the money pilin'
spend most of my time in the sky like a pilot
oval windows , yeah we only fly private
this my tenth flow , i don't know if you was countin'
money , sex , cars , and hoes
i need 'em all , you know
i'm the shit , i just thought i should mention
i know all of the bad bitches want my attention
i know all of you sad niggas wish you could live this
but tell me why you mad , nigga hatin' won't fix it
on the rise like a biscuit in my granny's oven
all my bitches call me daddy , never cha$e in public
my momma said i need to chill , i'm always up to somethin'
but that's only 'cause a nigga made it far from nothin'
