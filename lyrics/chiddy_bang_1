( ray charles ) ooh boy , open your eyes
a girl like me ain't waitin' all night
ooh boy , better think twice
i got that honey , that sugar , that spice ( ray charles )
yeah , hey yo i'm feelin' like ray charles
i got my shades on , i don't know where they are
you couldn't find me even if you had a radar
and i spit rapidly ak , ar
i make the music with the soul of a blind man
they be amazed how i get them ladies that cry , " yeah "
and they try to do it , but they're blind to the fact
that they're stuck in a trap and stayin' right where they at
but i'm ray charles , miss a calls
talkin' to my dime and i miss 8 calls
and i spit tough , bet you i'mma last great wall
i'm goin' ape y'all , i'm the new ray charles
i don't need no walking stick , my shit cost a grip
i get out the mouthwash if you talkin' shit
and i can hear the evil , but i won't see it
and if the blunt go out , you better reheat it
i got my black shades on , smoke it till it's gone
head to he sky , feelin' so on
ray charles , i'm - i'm ray charles
ray charles , i'm - i'm ray charles
i got the black j's on , dancin' to my the song
lookin' so fly and i'm feelin' so gone
ray charles , i'm - i'm ray charles
ray charles , i'm - i'm ray charles
ooh boy , open your eyes
a girl like me ain't waitin' all night
ooh boy , better think twice
i got that honey , that sugar , that spice
and i think i'm preheated , oven
they hear me spit , they think they know me like they cousin
but it's okay , we at the door that mean's we're buzzin'
now that's mcdonald's and baby i think i'm lovin' , it
but you know that size doesn't fit
mc hammer with this shit , like why the fuck would i quit
let's hire 40 people and get like 40 cars
and i wouldn't even drive cause i would be ray charles
see us and say , " whattup ? " like how the fuck is he talkin'
he don't even trip , like how the fuck is he walkin'
i'm blind man , yeah , like the three blind mice
and them haters , i'mma throw it on 'em
tell 'em i don't need no walkin' stick , my shit costs a grip
i get out the mouthwash if you talkin' shit
and i can hear the evil , but i won't see it
and if the blunt go out , you better reheat it
you're too blind to see it ( ray charles )
