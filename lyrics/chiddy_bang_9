is he moving too fast ? is she moving too slow ?
she telling me that i'm silly , but i'm only 2 - 0
and it sucks that she just want to be friends with me
i try to put her on where i'm at mentally
i'm full of energy
at times i need a remedy
for lack of things that interest me
but still her body is tempting me
she just keep rejecting me
why she keep stressing me ?
screaming like " don't touch me bitch , i don't got leprosy "
maybe we wasn't meant to be
but i was down bonnaroo , tennessee
in the rv , i can shut down a stage
casey had the veggies on the bus , we smoked a pound of haze
digress the tree can cold stress
when you feeling a bad bitch , but she showing you no interest
sending letters with no address
and she never gon' get it so let it rest
does she love me ?
no sir
does she want me ?
no sir
i think she hates me
what has she done for me lately ?
i'm high with no intent to land
i seem to fall for the girls with the short attention spans
who just wanna rendezvous
i would take her on a date , to a nice restaurant
but i got too much on my plate
said i'm here for a day
she hit me three hours late
found out i left the city , bet she had the sour face
told her i would kick it with her whenever i return
but that was based on the premise that she was my concern
searching for serious , life
then i was fast
had me speeding on this racetrack , furious
the kinda chick , the flyest nigga in the school he had her
but eff that , i'm trying to focus on what truly matters
i like em usually bad , always on punishment
having a conversation , wishing i could punish it
and why the fantasy so far from the truth , huh ?
running in circles playing duck , duck , goose , huh ?
we take the shit any slower , then we gonna hold up traffic
only hit the blunt once , then she fuckin' pass it
i knew we wasn't compatible
quarterback my feelings to the side , that's a lateral
i wish that i could be satisfied
i wish you would let me have a try
but there's a problem with you and i
now its chi - town , do or die
