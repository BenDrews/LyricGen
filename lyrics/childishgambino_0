fuck these other niggas
i'll be right by your side till 3005 , hold up
hold up , wait a minute , all good just a week ago
crew at my house and we party every weekend so
on the radio , that's my favorite song
make me bounce around , like i don't know , like i won't be here long
now the thrill is gone , got no patience , cause i'm not a doctor
girl why is you lying , girl why you mufasa
yeah , mi casa su casa , got it stripping like gaza
got so high off volcanoes , now the flow is so lava
yeah , we spit that saliva , iphone got message from viber
either the head is so hydra , or we let bygones be bygones
" my god , you pay for your friends ? " i'll take that as a compliment
got a house full of homies , why i feel so the opposite ?
incompetent ain't the half of it
saturdays we're young lavish - ing
saddest shit , is i'm bad as it
beans they took from the cabinet ( whoa )
sorry , i'm just scared of the future
till 3005 , i got your back , we can do this , hold up
no matter what you say or what you do
when i'm alone , i'd rather be with you
fuck these other niggas
i'll be right by your side till 3005
hold up , ( hold up ) , hold up , ( hold up )
hold up , ( hold up ) , hold up , ( say what )
hold up , ( hold up ) , hold up , ( hold up )
hold up , ( hold up ) , hold up , ( hold up ) ...
no matter what you say or what you do
when i'm alone , i'd rather be with you
fuck these other niggas
i'll be right by your side till 3005
hold up , ( hold up ) , hold up , ( hold up )
hold up , ( hold up ) , hold up , ( hold up )
hold up , ( hold up ) , hold up , ( hold up )
hold up , ( hold up ) , hold up , ( hold up ) ...
i used to care what people thought , but now i care more
i mean , nobody out here's got it figured out
so therefore , i've lost all hope of a happy ending
depending on whether or not it's worth it , so insecure , no one's perfect
we spend it with no shame , we blow that like coltrane
we in here like rogaine , or leave it like cobain
and when i'm long gone , whole crew sing a swan song
cause we all just ticking time bombs , got a lambo like lebron's mom
and no matter where all of my friends go , emily , fam , and lorenzo
all of them people my kinfolk , at least i think so , can't tell
cause when them checks clear , they're not here
cause they don't care , it's kinda sad but i'm laughing whatever happens
assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
labrador yapping , i'm glad that it happened , i mean it
between us , i think there's something special , and if i lose my mental
just hold my hand , even if you don't understand , hold up
no matter what you say or what you do
when i'm alone , i'd rather be with you
fuck these other niggas
i'll be right by your side till 3005 , hold up
no matter what you say or what you do
when i'm alone , i'd rather be with you
fuck these other niggas
i'll be right by your side till 3005
hold up , ( hold up ) , hold up , ( hold up )
hold up , ( hold up ) , hold up , ( hold up )
hold up , ( hold up ) , hold up , ( hold up )
hold up , ( hold up ) , hold up , ( hold up ) ...
hold up , hold up , hold up , hold up
hold up , hold up , hold up , hold up...
we did it ! yay !
nigga , you so thirsty
