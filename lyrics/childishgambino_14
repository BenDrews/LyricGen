daylight
i wake up feeling like you won't play right
i used to know , but now that shit don't feel right
it made me put away my pride

you make it hard for a boy like that to go wrong

if you want it , yeah
you can have it , oh , oh , oh
if you need it , oooh
we can make it , oh
if you want it
you can have it
but stay woke
niggas creepin'
they gon' find you
gon' catch you sleepin' ( oooh )
now stay woke
niggas creepin'
now don't you close your eyes
too late
you wanna make it right , but now it's too late

if you need it
