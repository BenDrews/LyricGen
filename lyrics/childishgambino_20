when we were coming down
they said it was too soon
i never had to lie , no , no , no , no
when we were coming down , they left us all alone
we're headed nowhere , nowhere
i know you've been around
i feel you in and out , how are you ?
do you sleep ? are you with me ?
we used to be unspoken , now everything is broken
i'm a good son , i'm a good son
you're a good son
you're a good son
you're a good son
free information , free information
free information , free informa—
arlanda , hotel to the bar
young girl with an accent with her back bent
ass out to the whole world
we can vibe out for tonight
stepping outside for a light
no coke , and i just smoke vapor , no papers
slow poke and i don't know 'bout photos
let's go though...
how old are you , saying that you never date older dudes ?
that's why i never wanna say no to you
the coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids
the coldest dude who can't hold his goose
" i'ma walk out ; wanna walk too ? "
what about dude ?
" fuck him , i just really wanna feel something "
it took me like five minutes to figure out
what voices those were , on the phone
but i figured it out...
is it real , cause you're online ?
is it real , cause you're online ?
is it real , cause you're online ?
is it real.. online ?
i'm a freaky bitch
i am 5 foot 8 , 390
and i am a freaky bitch
heathen , it's a struggle just to keep breathing
existential asthmatic , puff puff pass addict
craftmatic , making moves but they sleeping on me
we can kick it like it's fifa , homie
nevertheless , i got that fresh like it was crest
grind cause i'm stressed
tmj or tmi , it's a lie that you're living
i never understood the hate on a nigga preference
when every marriage is a same sex marriage
same sex everyday , monotonous
lost god , never prayed , forgotten us
lost love , never say just like our parents
too much power ain't enough power
brain splattered like i've fallen off a watch tower
and anybody can walk into any denny's
and wait until i'm walking in it
with a gun that they 3d printed and finish it
kinison said if you gonna miss heaven...
why do it by two inches ? old money and new bitches
getting next level in a hotel
ain’t shit that we don’t need
nigga oh well
