we were so jay z and beyonce , my aunt say " keep the sex game picante "
the aunt may and mary jane that i was hitting on
to make me try and forget that there was something wrong
love is russian roulette , i had the safety on
we popped pills at the coachella
hold my head in the weeds , man i can't tell her
the fear that i feel man it might kill her
man , it might kill her , it's the prep school mic killa'
with the drums and the groove so it feel dilla
