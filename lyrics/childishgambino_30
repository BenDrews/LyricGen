who the fuck , gambino , this nigga on your tivo ?
my hotel cost a kilo , banking like a free throw
fuck y'all , we a - team , y'all plan b like walgreens
cop that shit and paint it black , niggas want they summer back ?
ha - ha , no way , hublots , dolce
beans in my hand , girl in the car
she still with her man , but she seeing me tomorrow
homegirl on that master p , watch us ball like referees
unnecessary roughness ? we just trying to function
used to sport them filas cause my cousin pack them heaters
we don't wife 'em like khalifa , we just party then we leave 'em
tell 'em that we hittin' , we don't really see 'em
my girl look best when she only wear a fitted
q and 'bino in the house and you niggas in the senate

four thou' on my fit , that's unnecessary
skiing in japan , that's unnecessary
molly on my rider , that's unnecessary
'bino spit the fire , that ain't even necessary
that's unnecessary , that's unnecessary
that's unnecessary , that's unnecessary
roll out on a plane , that's unnecessary
'tussin and champagne , nigga that ain't even necessary
they said don’t buy the belt and i got it
they said don’t get the rollie and i bought it
nigga , i’m balling
my fucking mixtape can get you through college
getting them dollars
showing my pearly white teeth , i'm a nigga that’s flawless
came a long way from dumping out impalas
same gun and pants , different ski mask from coppers
all of this copper
knock knock , who could it be ? niggas know i got it on lock
yawk , yawk - bitch rappers better move ‘fore them niggas get dropped
mr. flop boy , you got your label hot
i’m the hardest out , you's a table cloth
unnecessary balling , i was carted off
been fucking with my side bitch so much my main bitch can’t stand it
hunned racks in three months , man this shit is outstanding
seen a dollar go to stupid racks , billion , trillion
nigga , that’s what i call building
‘bino what it do , let’s go half on a million
bathroom dvr , that’s unnecessary
pushing in that bulletproof , that’s unnecessary
stunting in the mall , that’s unnecessary
condo on my arm , that ain't even necessary
that’s unnecessary , that’s unnecessary
that’s unnecessary , that’s unnecessary
ibiza for a day , that’s unnecessary
shows a hundred k , that ain’t even necessary
black lip bastard
actual natural disaster
i did a song about dmt
soulja boy did one right after
3 eyes , these guys ain’t seeing me
no radio showed up over b.o.b
g - o - d emcee
i’m the devil with angel wings
pilot talk , currency
stole the show , burglary
i love that flow but i got more
open condoms in condos
open bottles of moet
white with white girls in eugene
we used to call hoes on 3 - way
and take 'em out to the movies
and now we just do it our way
she driving stick in the driveway
just popped a molly with miley
she do shrooms every blue moon
hundred million trillion muthafuckin' racks nigga
pinot grigio the lean’ll go in that nigga
now that's unnecessary
been a legend since elementary
ayo , bino , tell these niggas i ain't no joke
she don't need speak , she ain't giving no throat
you are under my control
suspend the l's but i'm on a roll
grade a , honor roll
mayday , soul !
