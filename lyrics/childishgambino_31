we gon' have a party
all my friends will be there
we drink all the vodka
there's music everywhere
now wait a minute ( wait a minute ! )
do you like to party ?
cause if you don't
don't come over here
we got smoking , blue dream
drinking , cocaine , fucking
i wanna show you what it is
thought i was done but that wasn't the case
got a new stack that i threw in your face
got a new girl and she look mila kunis
infinity pool , and a statue that's buddhist
got bottles and bottles and bottles of grino
saw i was rich , now they fucking with 'bino
brown leather bag , the vacation messina
the boat in the harbor , i rule the marina
10k for the drinks , now they say i'm insane
it's been that for a minute , now hedi slimane
i been black , lucrative , since danity kane
who came back for a minute , now everything changed
high as a kite , lime in the light
y'all niggas might whine every night
i ain't invite all these people to my mothafuckin' house
" get the fuck out of my house ! "
yo , chillâ€”
hey , chill , man !
