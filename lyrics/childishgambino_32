he slangs , his yay , through the corridors
every day , 20k , yep , at the very least for sure
and they say there's no way
i should stay with someone like you , but i tell them no
there's no way i could stray
gotta stay with someone like you
cause i know one day
you could take me away , far away
i know you could pay
all the money you made , there'll be plenty of sunshine
i never worry 'bout it
( act like you know )
( act like you know )
( act like you know )
