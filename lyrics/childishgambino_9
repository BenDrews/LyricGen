( who am i ? )
rec league , i ain't paying to ball
y'all b - string like a broke guitar
and i still put it down like the family dog
yeah , i murder some , i murder one
explain it all , ferguson
we ain't gotta sing the same old love song
cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
yeah , what you saying to it ?
old money look , no money don't do it
make 'em turn around in their lane like a u - ey
and i'm only looking back if i'm looking at her booty
( at her booty ) what's the rationale ?
they wanna smoke niggas when they black & mild
so we acting out—okay , cool

blue dream by the bouquet
'til i'm blue - faced on a tuesday
can i have some ?
" #niggasbelike " , put a +18 on an e - vite
and i said what i felt , no re - write
nah , nah , they can't hold me
june , july—drop something
i double dare you , i'm marc summers
i scorch winters , i burn autumns
gut niggas , so kurt vonne
elle varner , got a crush on her
i gotta wait in line for that
ain't nobody got time for that
ain't nobody gotta rhyme with that
too true like it's 2 chainz
blue blood like he both gangs
where we were , kinda thing
betcha crawl , all alone
where we were , kinda thing
betcha crawl , all alone
where we were , kinda thing
betcha crawl , all alone
where we were , kinda thing
