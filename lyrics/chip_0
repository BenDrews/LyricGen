now baby i'm the ripper , your baby daddy's worst nightmare
catch me by the clair , i'll be right there
niggas copy everything we say
louie frames , eyes lower than my g.p.a
riding and swerving , kush i'm blown
doors wide my trunk bump like eddy road
i don't cake hoes , i never tip the stripper
i'm rich bitch but you can call me cheap tha ripper
shell toes , yes. p.r.p.s
there's a man riding a horse on top of my chest
polo fresh , i am ze man
i be slam dunking tanqueray shots with lebron
told niggas keep it carmelo , okay
rolled past dave told him hello and hey
me and cash in something old on 23's ho
back window says " mama mel bicho "
skateboarders grind , i grind too
that's why you can catch me in d.c. shoes
i quit the team but believe i'm balling
want a verse , put up a stack or quit calling
30's on my chevrolet call me super duper
garage like roots i got more whips than kunta
riviera sitting on the bulls best hooper
y'all still riding 20's , y'all some oompa loompas
doors swang on niggas that got bad behavior
my four 15's woke up the neighbors
interior crocodile alligator
i drive a chevrolet movie theater
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ! ! ! ! !
