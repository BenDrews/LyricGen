some people have to learn
some people wait their turn
some people have to fight
some people give their lives
they wanna hold you back , tell 'em pee off
whenever they say you can't , take the c off
i remember when they told me i wouldn't be famous
now my dream and reality's simultaneous
and work your own way to the top
if they put you on a pedestal , they can take you off
and there's a higher level than the top
you gotta make more , don't make do with what you got
yeah , so get it in , sonny
not everybody gets a second chance at getting money
or even getting lucky
so you gotta feel the hunger in your tummy
i'm always pushing myself to the limit , making sure i stay ahead
you made me who i am , from the words you said
some people have to learn , some people wait their turn
some people but not me , i was born a champion
some people have to fight , some people give their lives
some people don't believe , but i was born a champion
but i was born a champion
but i was born a champion
uh , this gonna be the realest shit i ever wrote
off the records , no cameras , forget a quote
some of my family doing good , most doing dope
i'm from virginia where they hang them niggas by a rope
i used to see my momma getting beat down
is that the real definition of me now ?
i fell off , back on my feet now
headed to the sky , can’t even see down
award shows , i pour my heart out
and people still steady tryna point my flaws out
and i’d be lying if i say it ain’t get to me
but i’m a champion , legend , history
i'm always pushing myself to the limit , making sure i stay ahead
you made me who i am , from the words you said
some people have to learn , some people wait their turn
some people but not me , i was born a champion
some people have to fight , some people give their lives
some people don't believe , but i was born a champion
but i was born a champion
but i was born a champion
imagine you was the one , that couldn't get a look in
couldn't get a booking
couldn't get a push in when you needed a shove
or your buttons they be pushing
so now they tryna shush him
it's only you believing in you
they turn you into a bastard the moment you rude
attitude a little out of tune
but that's how champions move
yeah so go and get it in sonny
not everybody gets a second chance at getting money
or even getting lucky
so you gotta feel the hunger in your tummy
okay , no one wants to help , i guess you're on your own
build a foundation with the bricks they throw
in a black and white world , true colours show
change if you want , everybody grows
and life's like an eel , but try and get a hold
opinions ain't facts , take 'em in and let 'em go , that's right
you made me who i am , from the words you said
some people have to learn , some people wait their turn
some people but not me , i was born a champion
some people have to fight , some people give their lives
some people don't believe , but i was born a champion
some people have to learn , some people wait their turn
some people but not me , i was born a champion
some people have to fight , some people give their lives
some people don't believe , but i was born a champion
but i was born a champion
but i was born a champion
