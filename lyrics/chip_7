when i'm feeling lonely
sad as i can be
all by myself , an uncharted island
in an endless sea
what makes me happy
fills me up with glee
those bones in my jaw !
don't have a flaw
my shiny teeth and me
my shiny teeth that twinkle
just like the stars in space
my shiny teeth that sparkle
adding beauty to my face
my shiny teeth that glisten
just like a christmas tree
you know they'd walk a mile
just to see me smile ( woo ! )
my shiny teeth and me
( shiny teeth , shiny teeth )
yes , they're all so perfect
so white and pearly
brush , gargle , rinse
a couple breath mints
my shiny teeth and me
my shiny teeth , so awesome
just like your favorite song
my shiny teeth , i floss them
so they'll grow to be real strong
my shiny teeth , i love them
and they all love me
why should i talk to you
when i've got 32 ( woo ! )
shiny teeth and me
( shiny teeth , shiny teeth )
