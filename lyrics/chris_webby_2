ha , yeah , it's chris webby
danimal lector in the mo'fucking building
you know , connecticut , ha
webster's lab , bitch , let's go , yeah
you now have entered webby's world , welcome to my habitat
living like a jason statham movie , always action packed
killin' competitors , cause seein' me lose a battle rap
just don't happen these days like seein' a pterodactyl hatch
so give me beats and i'll be runnin' to the lab with that
go in with a pen and a pencil , come out with a bag of crack
show up with a bunch of goons , you ain't never matchin' that
roll so fuckin' deep , we know where to get krabby patties at
deeper than the ocean floor , u - 571
larry the cable guy , cause you know i'm 'bout to get her done
pushin' all your buttons , you would think i had an extra thumb
chug a fifth of moonshine , chase it with some ketel one
spit nice with raps to rip mics
carry my whole state on my shoulders until my discs slip twice
i'll keep strivin' for the title until i win right
this is what happens when you feed gizmo after midnight
a fuckin' gremlin , ain't nobody stoppin' that
cleats on my feet and i'm a play em like a soccer match
slaughter all these copycats , you could never follow that
( ground control to major tom ) i'm crazy do you roger that ?
eenie meenie miney mo , my weenie in your hiney hole
hidey ho neighbor as i light the dro , psycho flow
i can go from high to low , low to high man i don't know
too hot to touch , too cold to hold and right now i'm at 5 below
on the surface my mind's berserk , and i'm like give me a perc and a vic
with the verse i write , each word is precise
verbally nice , sharp as a surgical knife
for certain it's curtains , i'm the best you've heard in your life
bourbon and sprite , cause in the burbs we light the herb every night
curlin' the mic , just warmin' up , so quit your queefin' , it's girly
i'm eatin' 30 , geeze it's early , walkin' all weekend like bernie
i used to be weak and nerdy , now i'm diesel like the type of fuel
highway to hell , they didn't teach me this in drivin' school
you giant tool , i'm hittin' the track like ricky bobby
listen mommy , if , if you with a pretty body , then shit i'll probably
take brain , cause the kid's a zombie , never did karate
but it's daniel - san , all i'm missin' is mr. miyagi
i'm fuckin' crazy , smellin' like a skunk with rabies
punchin' babies , humpin' ladies , blame my mother cause she made me
i'm a product of the 80's , high as a kite , high on life
this rap shit is like ridin' a bike
i'm mr. starship trooper puttin' weed up in the hooka
hittin' on my friends' moms , tryna take me home a cougar
in your dreams like freddy krueger with the lyrical maneuvers
youtube , twitter , facebook , all up in your computer
i just live hakuna matata i'm kickin' it with pumba lightin' buddha
stayin' flyer than you losers , stella luna
i'm a dude who got some confidence , scratch that , cockiness
syllable after syllable out of my esophagus
you don't gotta roger that , but baby i'm a roger this
mothafuckin' party boy , call me chris pontius
bitch i'm just a jackass , higher than a rocket - ship
your chick reverse cowboy's the only one on top of this
she like , let me pull it out so i can swallow it
well , bitch you're sippin' greatness , you should spit it out and bottle it
the way you givin' brain you'll never get yourself a scholarship
in fact , at this point your fuckin' head's probably hollow bitch
i'm fuckin' nice so all you haters should acknowledge it
either way , who gives a fuck ? i'm makin' me a profit bitch
i got that molten lava flow , nobody hot as that
i'm the best in the burbs bitch , and you can roger that
