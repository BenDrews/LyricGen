we rollin' trees and smokin' la la la la la
another weed song from me
burnin' more trees than cheech chong
red and meth all roll together in the same l
we smoke blunts all day , you can't tell ? hell
i'm stompin' in with my boots on
rollin' to the diner with my half off coupon
fuck , i been burnin' since i was newborn
so high flyin' through space with jimmy neutron
that's how i do mon , rock the rhythm
you would think i had a mothafuckin' pot prescription
like the doctor's flippin' , my grass stay fresh cut
sticky icky wet stuff , put it in the next dutch
but last time i had a checkup , the doc said my brain was not fully developed
fuck , but it just don't matter , i'mma have to roll the next blunt fatter , ha !
la la la la la
just break it up and smoke that ( la la la la la )
now twist it up and smoke that ( la la la la la )
now light it up and smoke that ( la la la la la )
and then you keep on burnin'
the way this weed hits your chest , should invest in kevlar
chillin' on saturn , cruisin' in the xr
everyday i got the best bars
and the best weed same color as reptar
yes , we stay lightin' up the purple
in my own entourage , smokin' like turtle
fuck all the commercials , they all straight lies
actin' like i'm gonna kill a mothafucker cause i'm high
the most i'm likely to do is open the fridge
chill on the couch , and never end up leavin' my crib
shit , but that's just how i do
stay high , seein' from my birds eye view
i walk into a room and everybody starts sniffin'
" like , oh my god , i can guarantee that's christian "
" it's nine in the morning yo , what the fuck's with him ? "
and i'm like , " chill ! i've got a weed addiction " , like
we lightin' ganja ganja , every day we burn dutchies
and always we stay around more trees than fern gully
i earn money , spend on weed , and burn money
got the dice in my hand , can't take my turn from me
i rip like a beast when i hit the beats
but it's just weed when they say i'm equipped with heat
please , shit's leavin' you in disbelief
i'm that monster at your door , bitch , trick - or - treat
the way i freestyle , shit , it really baffles me
cause i'm a pot head , call me johnny appleseed
i got a dub and a dutch , let's roll and spark
til we start to see shit like joan of arc
i know i'm smart , i know i'm nice
that's why ya'll can't see me like a poltergeist
smokin' la la la , give that bowl a light
grab the bong even tighter than i hold the mic , like
