yea
i'm bowser bitch
let me blow some fireballs on these motherfuckers
call me bowser , hit em on a flow like a boss , bitch
it's inevitable that you steppin' on my level
in the end your gunna end up leavin' with a loss , bitch
line in the sand , i crossed it , grindin' till i'm exhausted
never gonna put the mic down
i'm here right now so what you want bitch
still here cause i flow rhymes , mixtape shit since , '09
only white dude in the game who made it this far without a cosign
baby and now it's showtime , they tellin' me that it's your time
freestylin' my destiny , bitches , i never wrote mine
so learn my fuckin' name , just know we not the fuckin' same
i'm fightin' for my life and the title just like the hunger games
have to gather my success , that connecticut , rough neck
any time a beat gets killed they lookin' for me
cause they know i'm the suspect
leavin' competition upset , grabbin' that girl , then we fuck , yes
they steppin' to me in a battle and winnin ?
that's like me passin' a drug test
shit will not happen , ready for action
gabbin' the mic and i'm gettin' it crackin'
no need for the braggin'
i know that i'm dope and homie you ain't even a fraction
but what i could do , i'm comin' for you and steadily killin' the rappin'
so fuck it i'm through , i'm pummelin' crews and leavin' the cypher laughin'
takin' bottles to the face till i'm like fuck man
so dirty my entourage follows behind me with dust pans
so slow it down some , sippin' on my styrofoam
trapped inside of webby's world like pauly shore in bio - dome
i roll an 8th of fire just so it can take me higher
molten lava flowin' , smokin' my volcano vaporizer
i haven't made it yet cause rap is full of politics
so all you politicians suck my dick until you swallow it
my dreams must have a twitter account , cause i'm a follow it
and anyone or anything in my way i'll demolish it
mothafuckin' monster steadily rippin' it proper
bitches so get to the chopper
mean as baracka , speakin' it lava
breaking it badder than tuco salamanca
killer with flow , bouncin' around like i'm tigger on blow
spittin' it so , outta control , trippin' the dough
the slower you thinkin' , the quicker i go
the pick of the litter with vigorous flow
keep the bitches titties jigglin' yo'
i stick and i go , i'm better than you
no matter how you try to figure it bro
the villain is back , killin' a track
won't stop till i got me a million in cash
listen to facts , r2 trigger attack , drop that magnificent rap
giggity , giggity , giggity , splat , the illest up in the vicinity's map
killin' theses bitches like trinity's back , with different rhythm so listen to that
so mario should do his cardio and grab a flower
cause you'll need to throw some fire balls if you gon' step to bowser
