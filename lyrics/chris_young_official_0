verse 1
i can spit metaphors and similies alike
i roll up on you bitches like i'm ridin' a bike
lance armstrong swag , cause this song is so dope
i'm cloggin' your speakers like there havin' a stroke
the beat drops , i bet you wish your balls did
i'm already famous and i'm still only a kid
this is that shit that you bang in your ride
the inside rumblin' you have pull aside
the bass so strong , it got tested for roids
make a fool out you infront of all your boys
i stand on my money , head butt chris young
hangin' with my b's and i never been stung
i'm so official , i'm on my yellow flag swag bitch
i'm throwin' fastballs , and i never threw a bad pitch
most of this spit , will fly right by head
but either fuckin way. i'mma leave the beat dead
sorry for the explicit shit that i've said
i got a foul mouth but my blood is still red
i'm kickin' shit off , like the start of the game
slippery flow like i'm spittin' in the rain
pop off at the mouth , like a motherfuckin' tart
i'm blowin' up bigger than a supersized fart
noone on the earth has swagger like i do
i'm the fuckin' shit and your pickin' up my poo pooo
steppin' inside the ropes , like a vip pass
sfeoa suck fuck and eat out ass
bitch i'm in the lead , your in dead fuckin last
they sayin' that i'm shady but i drink slim fast
i'm super swag spittin'. your pussy like a kitten
if money is the shit , then best believe i'm shittin'
this verse so ill but i feel so great
i'm eatin' this track like a pussy or steak
