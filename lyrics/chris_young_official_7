check , they tell me " 90s flow "
that's all i do , turn up and switch it up
try something new
cause the beat so hot and my seat so hot
and you know i'm dropping jewels ( whoo ! )
and my neck on froze and the grease is hot
and you know it's popping too ( whoo ! )
like '05 chris brown , young joc
it's going down
i can't change the way i came up
cause you know my flow is underground
that j.dilla , that backpack
these drug dealers got fat sacks
i'm in the a like 3 stacks
i'm running plays like warren sapp
i got 10 g - mails , tryna make it
none of my stories are fabricated
i was writing rhymes , yall was getting faded
protective style , my hair is getting braided
under the sew - in , damn it i go in
and that's fa sho ! in fact
in golden state with steph curry
told riley we gone win that ! ( swish )
with the flick of the wrist , my pen in my grip
since i was 6 , you think i just started ?
bitch , i'm a vet
get on your shit !
been an a&r since high school...
i was working with rich younglord , he signed with bad boy
when he was 16
producing classics , making hits
mixing for the greats
in 2010 , he hit me up , guess it was fate
mtv , when i was 17
looking for a big break
now i'm 22 up in the game
feel like ain't shit changed...
i gotta get it for myself
came across all these niggas in the game
man...ain't none of them help ( nah )
but god !
god told me if you make ya own lane
you gone get to the wealth ( get to the wealth )
and thats real ( ay ! )
and thats real...
i gotta get it for myself
came across all these niggas in the game
man...ain't none of them help ( nah ) ( shiiit )
but god !
god told me if you make ya own lane
you gone get to the wealth ( get to the wealth )
and thats real ( ay ! )
and thats real ( aye )
check , i never focused on the cash
cause the music is my passion
but as i got older and seen
other people passing
paying no homage we both at vsu
graduated college
you copy everything i do
and refuse to acknowledge
i'm peeping so it's cool
i'm a role model
i swear u have no clue
of half the shit i go through
i hope these lyrics show you
you gotta get it for yourself
i came across talented motherfuckers at vsu
ain't none of them help
but god !
god told me if you make ya own lane
you gone get to the wealth ( get to the wealth )
and that's real ( ay ! )
and that's real ( ay ! )
this is my 90's flow ( yo ! )
thanks for listening
thanks for getting it
i swear i'm pitting it
freestyle lipping it
lip - syncing , deep sinking
in the ocean so much corrosion
jxxiii got that parosion
peruding ya brain invading ya cells
invading ya mind , taking your time
winning your heart , and your spine
and your neck , no disrespect ( uhh ! )
put you in ya clique , in ya set
meet a vet !
cause me a vet
and me a chef , whipping , cooking
lil b , flick wrists , chefing
jxxiii reffing , official !
shoot you with a missile
