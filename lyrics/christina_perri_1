i can hold my breath
i can bite my tongue
i can stay awake for days
if that's what you want
be your number one
i can fake a smile
i can force a laugh
i can dance and play the part
if that's what you ask
give you all i am
i can do it
i can do it
i can do it
but i'm only human
and i bleed when i fall down
i'm only human
and i crash and i break down
your words in my head , knives in my heart
you build me up and then i fall apart
cause i'm only human
i can turn it on
be a good machine
i can hold the weight of worlds
if that's what you need
be your everything
i can do it
i can do it
i can do it
but i'm only human
and i bleed when i fall down
i'm only human
and i crash and i break down
your words in my head , knives in my heart
you build me up and then i fall apart
cause i'm only human
i'm only human
i'm only human
just a little human
i can take so much
'til i've had enough
