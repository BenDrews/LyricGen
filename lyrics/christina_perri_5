i believe if i knew where i was going i’d lose my way
i believe that the words that he told you are not your grave
i know that we are not the weight of all our memories
i believe in the things that i am afraid to say
hold on , hold on
i believe in the lost possibilities you can't see
and i believe that the darkness reminds us where light can be
i know that your heart is still beating , beating , darling
i believe that you fell so you would land next to me
‘cause i have been where you are before
and i have felt the pain of losing who you are
and i have died so many times , but i am still alive
i believe that tomorrow is stronger than yesterday
and i believe that your head is the only thing in your way
i wish that you could see your scars turn into beauty
i believe that today it’s okay to be not okay
hold on , hold on
this is not the end of me , this is the beginning
this is not the end of me , this is the beginning
hold on
this is not the end of me , this is the beginning
i am still alive
