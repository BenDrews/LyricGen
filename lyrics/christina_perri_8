the sun is filling up the room and i can hear you dreaming
do you feel the way i do , right now ?
i wish we would just give up
cause the best part is falling , call it anything but love
and i will make sure to keep my distance
say " i love you " when you're not listening
and how long can we keep this up , up , up ?
please don't stand so close to me , i'm having trouble breathing
i'm afraid of what you'll see , right now
i'll give you everything i am
all my broken heartbeats until i know you'll understand
and i will make sure to keep my distance
say " i love you " when you're not listening
and how long can we keep this up , up , up ?
and i keep waiting for you to take me
you keep waiting to say what we have
and i will make sure to keep my distance
say " i love you " when you're not listening
and how long can we keep this up , up , up ?
make sure to keep my distance
say " i love you " when you're not listening
how long till we call this love , love , love ?
