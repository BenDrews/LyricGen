the day we met
frozen i held my breath
right from the start
i knew it i found a home for my
heart beats fast
colors and promises
how to be brave
how can i love when i'm afraid to fall
watching you stand alone
all of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
one step closer
i have died everyday waiting for you
darling don't be afraid i have loved you
for a thousand years
i'll love you for a thousand more
time stands still
beauty in all she is
i will be brave
i will not let anything take away
what's standing in front of me
every breath
every hour has come to this
one step closer
i have died everyday waiting for you
darling don't be afraid i have loved you
for a thousand years
i'll love you for a thousand more
and all along i believed i would find you
time has brought your heart to me
i have loved you for a thousand years
i'll love you for a thousand more
i'll love you for a thousand more
one step closer
i have died everyday waiting for you
darling don't be afraid i have loved you
for a thousand years
i'll love you for a thousand more
and all along i believed i would find you
time has brought your heart to me
i have loved you for a thousand years
i'll love you for a thousand more
