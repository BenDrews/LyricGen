so , here we go
with my faith and my hand’s really shook up
airplane , take us away to new york city
music critique , record pressed
carolina , southern carolina
listen to me sing , new york city
and if your heart is broken
you’ll find fellowship with me
and if your ears are open
you’ll hear honesty from me , tonight
hair on my head , tongue in my mouth
i have got it all figured out
open up your heart tonight , new york city
tongue in my ear , hair in my mouth
i want you to figure me out
open up your arms tonight , new york city
and if your heart is broken
you’ll find fellowship with me
and if your ears are open
you’ll hear honesty from me , tonight
