all these pretty boys
looking for their heroine
every one of 'em
looking for a heroine , and
i should know cause i need my heroine too
relax
breathe a little bit
step back
think a little bit
before long you can't live without it
love is strong so beware about it
all these pretty boys
looking for their heroine
every one of 'em
looking for a heroine , and
i should know cause i need my heroine too
nights are long in search of a lover , so
say you'll stay i need no other , oh
all these pretty boys
looking for their heroine
every one of 'em
looking for a heroine , and
i should know cause i need my heroine too
oh i should know cause i need my heroine too
oh i should know cause i need my heroine too
oh i should know cause i need my heroine too
oh i should know cause i need my heroine too
big sun in the big , blue sky
it's got nothing on you
big moon in the dead of night
it's got nothing on you
white sands of a desert isle
it's got nothing on you
cover girl in the latest style
she's got nothing on you
no
big sun in the big , blue sky
