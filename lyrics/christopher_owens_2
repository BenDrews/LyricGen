here we go again , gotta keep on moving
here we come , gotta keep on loving
and i'm not sorry , gonna keep on grooving
i'm not sorry , gonna keep on using
having a good time , and we're singing
living the right life , never stopping
so don't try to get me down
don't try to harsh my mellow , man
don't try to make me quit
i'm gonna get right up and get out of it
try it on for size if it looks like a good time
give it a try if it's gonna get me high
and i'll get by if you stick with me , brother
i'll get high , if you give me another
and i'm floating like a feather
and i'm happy we're together
