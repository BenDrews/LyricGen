i've got your number in my phone
i plan on text messaging you when i get home
'cause you got what i want , man
and you've got what i need
it's a particularly selfish feeling
it's a gimme , gimme , gimme , gimme , gimme feeling
and i get so high that i hit the ceiling
particularly selfish feeling
you look like somebody from the movies
you look like somebody from seattle in the 90s
i wanna show you what i got , man
i wanna show you how i get myself off , man
'cause it's a particularly selfish feeling
it's a gimme , gimme , gimme , gimme , gimme feeling
yeah , i get so high that i hit the ceiling
particularly selfish feeling
a gimme , gimme , gimme , gimme , gimme feeling
then i get so high that i hit the ceiling
with my particularly selfish feeling
