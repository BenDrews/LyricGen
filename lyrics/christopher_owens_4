teach me how to love
somewhere i'd forgotten
not to love another
but to learn to love myself again
teach me how to give
i'm so tired of taking
i'm so tired of breaking
again , again , again
teach me how to care
not for you , my best friend
not your brothers's children
but to take care of myself again
teach me how to live
unafraid of dying
unafraid of trying
unafraid to fall
teach me how to dream
letting go of my fears
let them fall just like tears
again , again , again
teach me how to care
not for you , my best friend
not your brothers's children
but to take care of myself again
not to love another
but to learn to love myself again
not for you , my best friend
but to take care of myself again
