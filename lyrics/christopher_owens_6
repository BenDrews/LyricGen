the sun gets high and so do i
i'm gonna run my motor 'til the day that i die
i'm gonna drink from the water of the river of life and
let it take me
and if i had the chance
i wouldn't take it back
come on and kiss me
the sun gets low so here i go
i'm gonna sink to the bottom of the ocean floor
i'm gonna get down , honey , get real down low and
let it take me
and if i had the chance
i wouldn't take it back
come on and kiss me
pick me up , turn me on , make it fast
you only get one so make it last
i'm gonna sleep when i'm dead so when i get out of bed i'll
let it take me
and if i had the chance
i wouldn't take it back
come on and kiss me
up , down , turn around , touch the ground
hold on tight to the love that you've found
give it to me , honey , give me everything and
let it take me
and if i had the chance
i wouldn't take it back
yes , if i had the chance
i wouldn't take it back
and if i had the chance
i wouldn't take it back
come on and kiss me
