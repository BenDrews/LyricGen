i remember learning how to make a quick hundred bucks
sleeping in the back of a pickup truck
i remember looking down the barrel of a loaded gun
texas cops and cooking drugs
but look at us in new york city
everybody's listening to me
here we are in new york city
rock and roll in new york city
alright !
i remember begging my best friend for my life
he cut me and his wife with a pocket knife
i remember getting picked up for a petty crime
and getting locked up for holding a gun
