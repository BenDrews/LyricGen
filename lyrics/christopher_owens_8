nothing like a memory to open up a broken heart
it's been used but i look at you now and we're torn apart
nothing like a face to take you back to the time
when it was you and i against the world , just you and i
and i wish it hadn't happened to us , you fell in love with that girl
and i wish it hadn't happened to us , you fell in love with that girl
and i wish it wasn't true when all you cared about was the girl
nothing like a lover to set you up for a fall
when you're feeling ready to die , like you lost it all
nothing like hearing that in that place and time
and it's so hard letting go 'cause you're still on my mind
and i wish it hadn't happened then , but you fell in love with that girl
yeah , i wish it never happened to us , you fell in love with that girl
and i wish it wasn't true when all you cared about was the girl
