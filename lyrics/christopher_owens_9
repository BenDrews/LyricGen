sometimes a song is like a silver spoon :
what's the point unless it's in your mouth ?
and i don't need anyone to tell me
i think i'm big enough to figure it out
i'm a big mistake
i'm another loser fuck - up
i'm an accident
that's why i'm free to do what i want
sometimes a song is like a photograph :
everybody wants to figure it out
but you and i will see a different picture
and i don't need to tell you what it's about
or why the world is broken
why nobody cares for no one
why we're killing each other
and everybody's looking for love
don't be afraid to live
don't be afraid to die
don't be afraid to fail
don't be afraid to try
or say , " i want you "
