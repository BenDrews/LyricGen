want to change my ways but i'm just trying to make a decent pay
fuck working for the man i want my shit the easy way
i'm scheming on the block but i'm just trying to find a get away
done had way too many sleepless nights
compete with guys who delete on sight
if you selling white at a cheaper price
truth is it don't matter about your brain matter
your brain splatter you sling cane get slang faster
the same bastard that aim at you give you the name casper
done have you in a wood grained casket
you had your shot now your going to the top for key
when you return i'm just hoping that you got your receipt
or you'll be calling peoples phones like you forgot about me
sheesh
i suggest you take a different route
coming home smelling like weed your mom gon' kick you out
get a job set some goals man plan to get a house
we all try to get this cheddar but sometimes there's big amounts
we all got dreams and sometimes we try to live them out
got to make it happen opportunities ain't given out
aiming for swiss accounts with nothing but big amounts
i'm getting laid while i'm in a daze
i'm too paid and headed for the top like toupees
cooking up that recipe like soufflés
on the real i'm hoping for a new day
i just hope i got time and i ain't too late
i'm too paid and headed for the top like toupees
cooking up that recipe like soufflés
on the real i'm hoping for a new day
i just hope i got time i ain't too late
claim you been at the can for spraying cats but couldn't hurt a fly
you don't want to be verse as i cause when i lerk inside i'm merking guys
i versify rehearse my lines till the hearse is prime
living divine bending trees like turpentine
we ain't missing any components
so puff on it all our buddha it comes potent
i'm up on it show me who my next opponent
i unload the gun blow he's a bad boy you done know that i
roll up in a rag top i'm just a young have not
that's reaching the stash box to blast ( bleep )
i cook em' like lamb chops
there's blood all on the floor like a back drop
meaning that it's time i shift like a caps slot
i breeze from the scene cause i ain't trying to be seen
pay the price when you defiant i ain't trying to be mean
no , i ain't trying to be mean na mean ?
i'm just trying to get creme
i'm getting laid while i'm in a daze
i'm too paid and headed for the top like toupees
cooking up that recipe like soufflés
on the real i'm hoping for a new day
i just hope i got time and i ain't too late
i'm too paid and headed for the top like toupees
cooking up that recipe like soufflés
on the real i'm hoping for a new day
i just hope i got time i ain't too late
don't get it mistaken you can get your mints taken
forget changing i want to be known for risk taking
even chicks with buns get ( ? )
them pros get fried on lit pot like crisp bacon
we burning down not a sound even though it's loud
see them ( ? ) serve them rounds when i murder clowns
staying in the same timezone when i purchase pounds
once her bag is filled she don't care if her purse in style
sargent fly shit is my rank
if shit get hot i'm in her tank
i start to fire i'm letting them go
them water fix eat when i'm pedaling dough
and i know that there will be better days to come
but i ain't trying to be dead or very young
sometimes i feel like i'm ahead of everyone
i couldn't tell you what it was but i guess it where i'm from
i'm getting laid while i'm in a daze
i'm too paid and headed for the top like toupees
cooking up that recipe like soufflés
on the real i'm hoping for a new day
i just hope i got time and i ain't too late
i'm too paid and headed for the top like toupees
cooking up that recipe like soufflés
on the real i'm hoping for a new day
i just hope i got time i ain't too late
