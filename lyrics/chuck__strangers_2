late night , down wind , and they schemin on your pantie
it's best to blend in , bredrin
and hope your dice rolls seven , if not , phone kevin
he a friend of mine , he not really pussy
but not really a tough guy , when he shot his nine
yo , he listen to doves cry , back in the days
he would give me a whole eighth and walk me to the train safe
told me , grown men walk , only coward niggas strafe
when i was a lil nigga , he'd show me his toast
i'd follow him out to gucci when he was coppin his loafs
and now i boost the beat till the floor shake
and i'm a spit the pain till the world ache
no debate , speak on my nigga life
cause my mans was great at the corner store on thirty eighth
like can we get together , all riders ?
for a day filled with promise , polos , and pradas
midnight marauders , peace to your momma
she knew me as chey , lil fat nigga always
stealing racks from the crates , wanting to bust moves
trying hard to be arrogant , parish fews
the high top ones , i had the white with the blue
and ain't nobody feel me but you , so bump this shit
while you sip on your brew , reminiscing on the real
nigga shit we went through , my dude , my dog
used to see you politicin up at the rim spot
q - tip , dre , kanye , demonte ? and you had put me
in your fifth spot , now your nigga's shit tight
like a wrist watch , word
ayo word , how they face could ever fester my feelings
man this soul too appealin , my music revealin
the insides of a nigga , i heard your cd your rhymes is iller
man , you can't stand them brooklyn guys
i be all move with the lava , then you look in the eyes
hood scholar , i ain't never been to college , learned it all on my block
bread force , but it sway , word to knowledge of pac
word
so east flatbush it's disgustin , flows he bustin
in the same polo sport , my mans beside me
he worried about them lil niggas in the building lobby
i ain't tough , but kept a blade since them niggas robbed me
yeah the world too cold
niggas shinin shit and callin it gold , soon as your album drop , they callin it old
i kill flows and jeans with no holes in 'em
and all these beats got soul in 'em
i'm so winnin , but you prayin i lose
when i'm back in brooklyn , i get the choos , she like buy me black guy shoes
them socks with birkenstocks lowkey had you amused
but you still get undressed cause i need a muse
now we lit as a fuse , it's no rules to the posse
if you from where i'm from , so i gave that bitch power
word , my dick is a gun , your new disc went dumb
but trey up in this bitch , you went fuckin with sum
