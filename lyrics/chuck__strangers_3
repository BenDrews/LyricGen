i don't fuck with you , but i answered when you texted
fuck was you expecting , i'm just a reckless
young black nigga needing your acceptance
i guzzle on this henny , i do it to hide scars
do the beats like blacks , i put 'em behind bars
junior resting in heaven , god bless him

it's a new day
it's a fine line between that nigga trey and clich√©
i had fifty dollars on my nigga , release date
and still copped it
cause we was brothers from the start , nigga fuck profit
he just came with the ammunition to become a musician
peep my gram bro , i be in the kitchen
why you dissin' , i don't
