i'm with the homies - for breakfast in the morning
put it in the air , rolling up about a quarter
i need to bend a corner - she tryna get up on me
you cuter than a button but i'm tryna make some money
putting hundreds , fifties , twenties into a knot in my sock
triple that , i put a band into my ewing shoebox
now how much do you got - karate chopping the shop
i shot a chopper i'm hot
prodigal rocking a watches while i been clocking these calls
man you know what i'm 'bout
beep me , meet me up at the chinese takeout
beep me if you need another one for the drop
system loud , riding out like i ain't fucking with cops
top down , riding 'round and i'm hitting the spots
i got bass off in my trunk g i don't fuck with the law
ahhh - peace to my dogs
cookies in my raw , i'm about to get it all
peace to my dogs
cookies in my raws , man i'm 'bout to get it all
shit , built ford tough
couple sports cars here to pick these up
whoop whoop whoop whoop , say i won't
getting dough , nigga , say i don't
handle problems like a harlem globetrotter
off my knee , through the net , use your head , i'm talking soccer
talking who's got it , lowkey who's hotter
honest - i'm really out here partner
you can ask ya grandmother 'bout me
riding in the monte , shaking dice , rolling chronic
unstrapped uptowns , i'm the air force rocker
on the block with a robert horry jersey from the rockets
poetic with my sonnets , eclectic with the knowledge
what i'm really saying though is my shit be the hottest
drop convertibles in august , now they gotta call us
cause niggas rip the tape like a velcro wallet
put the scarecrow on 'em , what you gon' do 'bout it
in the drop bronco with them big ass tires
