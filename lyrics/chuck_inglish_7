in the mgm grand with my dogs shooting craps
rolling dice , close my eyes , hit a 7 then a 9
ringside , in a suite , hit 11 , courtside
big time n'ahmean , what's good , what you selling ?
big gold rings on my hands like the champions
in the hamptons , its what's happening
montauk sailing yachts like a captain
bossing up then bussing down like i'm trapping
pushing saab drop tops out like a phantom
rapping ass nigga in that little ass jacket
if the shoe fits , wear it , if i said it then i said it
the original live sportswear trendsetter

we leaders of the future , fuck the past
i fucked her head first , and ass last
before i see that hearse , you trash bags

she wanna be home before the dust up
i told her bitch you grown , shut the fuck up
made it too far from home , for me to nut up
so it won't be long before i blow up
i'm with miss america in bulgaria
she say i'm too mysterior for her caterier
sorry if i luminate ya over there
wake up and smell the paint
only scott and chuck can make it rain
so all you stupid fucks should be ashamed
the young gods of the game
back , back , back , back , this is baghdad
quicksand trap , this is that and a bag of dough
it's me and travis though , xx driving slow
ss 4 by 4 , lift this off the floor
helly hanson duck feather bubble hands soap dish
cleaner if i wash it cold , this is what the faucet's for
nigga , don't get wet
sprinkle a little bit , this is all you get
back in this shit like a toilet
still on the phone , ironing clothes , doing laundry
wire frame cartiers , catch me at the party
it's cool if you on it , but you know you saw me start it
