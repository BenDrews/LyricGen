back up ! let me get my shit back
and if it's like that then let's scrap then nigga
facts , i'm nice with these hands , jack
in the mgm grand with my dogs shooting craps
rolling dice , close my eyes , hit a 7 then a 9
ringside , in a suite , hit 11 , courtside
big time n'ahmean , what's good , what you selling ?
big gold rings on my hands like the champions
in the hamptons , its what's happening
montauk sailing yachts like a captain
bossing up then bussing down like i'm trapping
pushing saab drop tops out like a phantom
rapping ass nigga in that little ass jacket
if the shoe fits , wear it , if i said it then i said it
the original live sportswear trendsetter
y'all ain't bring shit back , man you niggas know better
back up , let me get my shit back
back up , let me get my shit back
back up , let me get my shit back
back up , down like i'm trapping
back in this shit like a toilet
on the phone plug , ironing clothes , doing laundry
then the phone rung on that mug like i'm hustling
back in business , you a customer
call accountants like the irs coming
at your doorstep and they don't play about they money
catch me and justin chopping blades in a cutlass
think i'm playing , check the number , if i said it then i own it
rolling marijuana on a beach in california
i had it parked on the corner , play yo part lil' homie
don't watch me , watch tv
ay , they giving out degrees for niggas studying me
but i ain't tripping , just let me get my shit right
ask twice , man i'm not that nice
cracking knuckles , sounds live like ice right now
you need to live life off lines i write down
