high class , if the stock crash
got gold bars in the book bag
small jabs , makin' large stacks
two - stepping how stella got her groove back
the crew's wrapped , this is how we do raps
this is breaking news. what you doing ? how you do that ?
who asked you to do that ?
( get off yo phone when you on the dance floor ! )
this ain't preschool , i don't do it for my health
it's in the bank , it's accumulating wealth
i feel great , it looks great
we 'bout to order up the lox plate
fresh - squeezed everything
got there , hit the store , copped everything
olympic trial nigga gold medal everything
feeling like i can do anything
this is all that we want
not much , give it all , give it up
if it ain't all for the love
this is all that we love
ay yo my cake taste great
let me eat when i wake and i bake
head straight , i'mma make it
got my name carved in the tree
work hard dog , art star all in a day
we gon' ball , get paid
get caught in the dark , or lost in thoughts from eighth grade
when i first heard curse words , new bro slang
rirruto. who doe ? new ballgame
gimme the loot , it's a too dope thang
kudos , you know , choose yo , lane
numero uno , use yo krang
don't be so amazed when they use yo name
while y'all sittin' talkin' 'bout who's kang
you should be ashamed , what are you saying ?
this is life when we write it and recite
we the titans of the tight , being the brightest of the light ( c'mon...uh )
