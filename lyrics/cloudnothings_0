it starts right now , there's a way i was before
but i can't recall how i was those days anymore
i'm learning how to be here and nowhere else
how to focus on what i can do myself
i'm not telling you all i'm going through
i'm not telling you all i'm going through
i'm not telling you all i'm going through
i feel fine , but
i'm not telling you all i'm going through
i'm not telling you all i'm going through
i'm not telling you all i'm going through
i feel fine and...
leave it all to memory of what we did when we were young and
now you could just leave me on my own
i'm moving toward a new idea , you're not what i really needed
now you could just leave me on my own , but...
i'm not , i'm not you
you're a part of me , you're a part of me
it's over now , there's a way i was before
but i can't recall how i was those days anymore
i'm learning how to be here and nowhere else
how to focus on what i can do myself
you're the thought that's haunting
you're the thought that's haunting me
you're the thought that's haunting
you're , you're the thought that's haunting
you're the thought that's haunting me
you're the thought that's haunting me
you're the thought that's haunting me
you're , you're the thought that's haunting
you're the thought that's haunting me
you're , you're the thought that's haunting me
you're , you're the thought that's haunting me
you're the thought that's haunting
