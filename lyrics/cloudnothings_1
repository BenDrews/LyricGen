i know
my life's not going to change
and i'll live
through all these wasted days
never thought
that i'd end up this way
and i know
it's going to stay the same
i thought
i would
be more
than this
i know
i'm losing all my time
doesnâ€™t seem
like it was ever mine
feeling sick
but i don't know why
getting tired
of living 'til i die
