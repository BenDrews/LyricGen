i go outside and see all these things that should be real
come on , you're a part of it , can you breathe or can you feel ?
you're not the same as me but i know we share a thing
no use remembering how it used to be so real
i can feel your pain , and i feel alright 'bout it
i can feel your pain , and i feel alright 'bout it
i can feel your pain , and i feel alright 'bout it
i can feel your pain , and i feel alright 'bout it
we're moving quickly to the same ( now hear in )
i feel there's nothing left to say ( now hear in )
a simple life could be so strange ( now hear in )
if we’re just living here today ( now hear in )
