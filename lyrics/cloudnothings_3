you'll never be here , it's hard to explain
psychic trauma , returns with age
there's nothing new here , no room to relate
i don't know what you're trying to say
try to stop it , try to feel something
but nothing happens , i stay the same
is it alright to end up this way ?
life gets boring , it fades away
i can't believe that what you're telling me is true
my mind is always wasted listening to you
i can't believe that what you're telling me is true
my mind is always wasted listening to you
