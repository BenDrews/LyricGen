here we are among the living
see and count your friends
gathered in a room together
this is how it ends
can't stand the modern act
whose war is this , what god is that ?
feels like the tide is only
starting to come in
do you know what it's like
to be out and alive ?
to say you're doing alright
yeah , you're doing just fine ?
when you feel like an ocean
coming out of a creek
filling rivers to wait for you
wherever you are
when you're out and around
and all you ever see
are people looking away
it's nothing new to me
i want a life , that's all i need lately
i am alive but all alone
i want a life , that's all i need lately
i am alive but all alone
i want a life , that's all i need lately
i am alive but all alone
i want a life , that's all i need lately
i am alive but all alone
calling on the light , forgiving
see to all and then
waiting on the old , expiring force
to go and end
can't stand the modern act
whose war is this , what god is that ?
feels like the tide is only
starting to come in
do you know what it's like
to be out and alive ?
to say you're doing alright
yeah , you're doing just fine ?
when you feel like an ocean
coming out of a creek
filling rivers to wait for you
wherever you are ?
when you're out and around
and all you ever see
are people looking away ?
it's nothing new to me
i want a life , that's all i need lately
i am alive but all alone
i want a life , that's all i need lately
i am alive but all alone
i want a life , that's all i need lately
i am alive but all alone
i want a life , that's all i need lately
i am alive but all alone
left the light on to take account
of all the fire in me
won't come over and make it out
a little lighter to see
left the light on you
take account of all the fire in me
won't come over and make it out
a little lighter to see
i want a life , that's all i need lately
i am alive but all alone
i want a life , that's all i need lately
i am alive but all alone
i want a life , that's all i need lately
i am alive but all alone
i want a life , that's all i need lately
i am alive but all alone
