can i see , what's going wrong with me ?
i used to have it all , now i'm alone
i'd never say , i'm better off this way
i need something to do , somewhere to go
i need time to stop moving , i need time to stay useless
i need time to stop moving , i need time to stay useless
i need time to stop moving , i need time to stay useless
i need time
how can i feel , so utterly unreal ?
like nothing i could do , would make things change
i'm stuck in here , and i'm tired of everywhere
i'm never gonna learn , to be alone
i need time to stop moving , i need time to stay useless
i need time to stop moving , i need time to stay useless
i need time to stop moving , i need time to stay useless
i need time
oh , oh , oh
oh , oh , oh
oh , oh , oh
oh , oh , oh
i need time to stop moving , i need time to stay useless
i need time to stop moving , i need time to stay useless
i need time to stop moving , i need time to stay useless
i need time
