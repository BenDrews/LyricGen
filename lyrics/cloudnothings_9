there's something wrong here , nothing in the air is moving
i feel a chill and try to keep my body walking
another person looks like he is right behind me
i'm moving forward while i keep the past around me
pattern walks , pattern walks
pattern walks in the moon tonight and
pattern walks , pattern walks
pattern walks in the moon tonight and
i'm slow at times , that leaves its face for no improvement
a little piece of a lie to keep it there and moving
another person has to be just right behind me
i'm moving forward while i keep the past around me
pattern walks , pattern walks
pattern walks , pattern walks
pattern walks , pattern walks
pattern walks , pattern walks and
i don't feel bored or worried , i just feel strange
coming up the middle of the thought that i could change
i don't feel bored or worried , i just feel strange
coming up the middle of the thought that i could change
i thought , i thought
i thought i never would remember , would remember
i thought , i thought
i thought i never would remember , would remember
i thought , i thought
i thought , i thought
i thought , i thought
i thought , i thought
