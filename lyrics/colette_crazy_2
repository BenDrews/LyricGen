ain't been to work in a while but im still racking up
to all those chicks that's played me im still backing up
i used to b nervous but now im mackin up
i just gotta show out so sorry mom im acting up
and i know you know i know that that's not how u raised me
but i think playing football made me a little crazy
i left it to myself a knife and mic then i made me
the hunger for change is actually what i b craving
i have never felt special except talking mentally
never won a prize the easy roads just weren't meant for me
i don't get upset because you people never get i me
fell in love with music i guess that this was meant to be
i been shining from my own ain't nobody mentoring
music don't just leave a mark my tunes they b denting and
hopefully this track will get the people to remember me
cuz i gotta find a way to get them ta start mentioning
not worried about my " swag "
but im worried about my dad
haven't seen him in a while
but he call my phone we talk and laugh
like i love you pop
who next ?
sorry for the pause but its a short wait for greatness
i bring real to the game a vaccine for the fakeness
watch 99% of these rappers they die around me
my new flow is so astounding
its so wet it'll probably drown me
i'm constantly getting better
could just be the weather
your the king of queens can't segregate coretta
i'm crazy and off my rocker
got screws loose i need a doctor
killing the opposition and shove them into one locker
speaking figuratively and literal come check my basement
lyrics a machete they slice looking up to jason
your facing a killer i'm adjacent with the mercenaries
my hearts cold so i'm hanging with the sagittaries
in february damn november , december
but i'm still ice cold take notes to remember
i gotta cold heart but spit fire so its icy hot
clogging up your brains i'm similar to a blood clot
b.hold
i got a couple texts to my phone
one in particular was alph , said he had a predicament , asked me how could i fix it ? / he told me murder this instrumental an don't leave a witness
so tuck ya neck when you listening to this fire i'm spitting
pissing on all the critics that got negative opinions
no disrespect but i'm about to show y'all all my opinions
i had to run around this track for the cypher
i might just take control of rap for the nigh
it's something light cause i'm light on my feet
i'm writing more songs by the week
stabbing this song and the beat
saving opponents to eat
they say i'm cocky but obviously that's a issue
the truth truth gone get revealed like you opening gifts on christmas and i started slacking in school i was constantly rolling swishers but i'm back on my game
back on my aim
run so i'll miss you ( gunshots )
i never let opponents escape but i'll spare you
and i'm sorry if my lyrics can scare you
i'm scared too
