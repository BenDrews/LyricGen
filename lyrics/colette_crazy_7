so far , so fun , the cops done run us off of the dq lot
we burned a tank up , dang near drank up all the beer we bought
the trucks done covered up in mud , can't see a drop of paint
down to three dollars , lord a whole lotta hell's already been raised
but the night ain't over yet
there's a whole lotta moonlight left
to do things we might regret tomorrow morning
you'd think it's crazy as it's gonna get
but the night ain't over yet
tore up the town , already closed down , two or three honky tonks
bill fought the wrong guy , left with a black eye , we had to pull him off
talked beth and sue out of their daisy dukes and into a skinny dip
we'd be worn out but we're just about to catch our second wind
but the night ain't over yet
there's a whole lotta moonlight left
to do things we might regret tomorrow morning
you'd think it's crazy as it's gonna get
but the night ain't over yet
first one yawning , they'll be walking
we ain't stopping till sunrise so hold on tight
the night ain't over yet
there's a whole lotta moonlight left
to do things we might regret tomorrow morning
ain't no bail been made , no rights been read
tammy's still got her top on her corvette
it ain't got crazy as it's gonna get
well , the night ain't over , night ain't over
night ain't over yet , oh yeah
