my motto is : chicago , bitch
everybody know you sweet , what the problem is
don’t play dumb , i’m the one that acknowledged it
son of a bitch , i imagine what your father is
she said , “how you make your opponent
the rapper of the moment ? ” his style , he don’t own it
acting all hard when he hardly like that
you gon’ mess around and make me catch a body like that
don’t do it
cause every song you make , joe , is really ho music
i heard you said you wasn’t a bitch because you sing
you a bitch because you cling like a bitch that’s eighteen
can’t say my name but rap about a nigga’s wife
you so black and white , trying to live a nigga’s life
i’m taking too long with this amateur guy
you ain’t wet nobody , nigga , you canada dry
soft nigga. make no mistake , i’m talking to drake
it’s the remix. rick ross , common , and that ho - ass nigga
no , man - to - man , don’t hide behind them other niggas
nah , this man - to - man. you can’t run behind them man
this is some real man shit right here
say my name , say my name
if no one is around you
if you ain't running game
say my name , say my name
you acting kinda shady
why the sudden change ?
say my name , say my name
if no one is around you
if you ain’t running game
say my name , say my name
you acting kinda shady
better say my name
