pt. i : common logic
may i ask in what way your life is contributing to society as you sit here day after day after day in this dark room , stringing along on that stupid guitar ? have you ever thought about that ? what are you doing for the world or for other people ? day after day , hour after hour , night after night
me and my homies just chillin' feelin' the vibes
this the time of our lives but many don't realize
havin' visions of livin' on another level , never signed to the devil
the rebel that be fuckin' 'round with the treble
bumping tribe in the system like penicillin , motherfucker
i'm killing , spittin' venomous never remember this it's like a system
say it then i do it , i never missed 'em
fuck 'em after i kissed 'em , sit back and listen
my chain , it glisten , it's like i'm from another dimension
did i mention my circle's smaller than an intervention
then some beautiful women tell me i'm handsome
then i snatch they heart and make the pussy the ransom
i fuck 'em until inside they belly burst
stop it , drop the beat and then we cue the verse
spitting lyrics like how a mac - 11 really disperse
slaughter mcs and resurrect them when they in the hearse
they say i got too many styles , bitch i've been diverse
they scared to jump in the cypher , i be all up in it first
my apologies but if you're after me then it gets worse
when i come through i spit voodoo and leave 'em cursed , common logic
pt. ii : midnight marauder
seven times out of ten we listen to our music at night , thus spawned the title of this program. midnight marauder. midnight marauders. midnight marauders. music
sounds like some... some '90s shit. it's a good farewell... i suppose
this is the realest , only unto the real shall i reveal this
i even made this beat my self just so y'all could feel this
from nasty nas , big l to tribe called quest
we the rattpack , in other words the tribe that's next
it's been a long time and i ain't even in my prime
i remember many moons ago spitting the realest lines
on the come up , matter fact it was long before that
before i bought my first mic , before i could afford that
this is a letter to the underground , the place where i'm from
this is a letter to the fans that understand what i've done
and even though i gotta leave man don't none of y'all grieve
'cause even in the mainstream that lyricism i breathe
some of y'all love my raw records , some of y'all don't
some of y'all will love my radio shit , some of y'all won't
just like my race , my music has always been yin and yang
something for everybody , no not just one lane
and on the real , i'll never forget the day i got my deal
full creative control and the money was unreal
started from the bottom and got here 'cause of my skill
and i never set a goal that i didn't plan to fulfil
this is the realest , only unto the real shall i reveal this
i even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
from nasty nas , big l to tribe called quest
we the rattpack , in other words the tribe that's next
this is the realest , only unto the real shall i reveal this
i even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
from nasty nas , big l to tribe called quest
we the rattpack , in other words the tribe that's next
this is the realest
yeah , yeah , this the realest
the realest , say what ? say what ?
this is the realest , only unto the real shall i reveal this
i even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
from nasty nas , big l to tribe called quest
we the rattpack , in other words the tribe that's next
this is the realest , only unto the real shall i reveal this
i even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
from nasty nas , big l to tribe called quest
we the rattpack , in other words the tribe that's next
this is the realest , only unto the real shall i reveal this
i even made this beat myself just so y'all could feel this
from nasty nas , big l to tribe called quest
we the rattpack , in other words the tribe that's next
this is the realest
this is the realest
