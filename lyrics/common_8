i want a bitch that look good and cook good
cinderella fancy , but she still look hood
butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
plus she trickin' off the dough that her man makes
we got our own handshake , her titties ain't fake
fucking in the car cause we just can't wait
to get home , early in the morn' getting stoned
pretty with her eyes low , money by her bible
the type of bitch that big said he would die for
is the type that i ride and stay alive for
tats on her back , looking all tribal
she know shoes like she know survival
well put together , she weathered the storm
seen her brother die so forever she's strong
hear beyonce's song and she gotta perform
whether fucking or fighting : we getting it on

i don't even say shit , she can feel it
eye talk's the realest , toenails acrylic
ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it
baby in one arm , the other is a skillet
fried chicken , macaroni , raised on the back of stony
ghetto prince , she's my apollonia
like chick that had the back of tony , montana
reminded me a me of my , of my mama
knowing the drama like she know when to joke
steal a nigga's squares , not wanting me to smoke
i poke my head out of benzes
my tweets is the streets that i know who my friends is
endless love for the money , power and clothes
my ghetto housewife watch reality shows
she might get to snapping if the cabinets ain't closed
when the cameras start snapping , she's ready to pose

i notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
subject matter be changing too quickly at times
so i keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story
call me a pro in the pussy category
had explicit experiences i shouldn't mention
for me , getting women turned from sport to addiction
powerful women playing the roles of submission
lawyers on leashes , congresswomen inflictin'
pain onto my game , wanted and i'm sadistic
they liked it , they dyked it , devices twisted
'til i get a nice chick , to get me on some nice shit
crib raising kids , labrador behind the white fence
but i'm still single , looking for cleopatra
african queen , yo look at me , i'm a bachelor
y'all niggas in trouble , keep your girls behind closed doors
cross your fingers , be happy i haven't chose yours
she love glamour , bought her vera wang sandals
valentino bags is my etiquette , my manors
half hood half class , photographers' cameras
caught us out there , the spotlight , hope she can handle this
she can join me , red carpet at my next non - profit
events having sponsored by some alcohol product
jumping out a bentley with some fresh red bottoms
you live your dream with me when you were just in the projects
