well if you ask me how i'm livin' i'm just livin' life
from south central to the waters where these kids reside
i'm a south central la nigga just a different type
went to miracosta so the homies think i'm getting white
hit the beach at day
then i'm back at 65th at night
bitch i ain't complaining i just really have to shed some light
still leave the crib and make sure i don't forget the knife
the knife got me feeling like i'm superman
but praying i don't run into a crip tonight
that orange nike sign looking red in a different light
niggas rather kill than fight
familiar faces drown me but that attitude swi - switch at times
ha , 'lotta pain 'lotta funerals here

my team stacked your feedback , don’t need that
my crew rollin' and see hoes at each show
scream i love , don’t know them
all facts , you tall tales , you got shells , you don’t load 'em
claim parts that bang hard they don’t know you
i just had hopes and bars , now its nova scotia corporate cards
friendly hoes and open bars
make a wish girl , hold a star
the joke is off , play the game and know your cards
i hope that you came to show 'em off
don’t be ashamed to show 'em off
let’s play the game below the bra
bitch , don’t be ashamed to show 'em off
but hold your heart , i'ma do it 'til we runnin’ the game
top floor in the bay and fuck it
when i overdone it i never done it in vain
do it for my niggas ‘cause we one and the same
we just rented a house for a week , i need that shit forever and ever
if i got it , i wonder , whatever would happen to me
cause i just keep meetin’ new people
that i can't remember and wonder “how did we happen to meet ? "
i used to think niggas like that was assholes
and now i’m like " how did that happen to me ? "
strapped to the seat , i’m killin' the crash course
eyes on the road , eyes on the road but never the dashboard
if i want to know , if i want to know your opinion i’d ask for it nigga
my team stacked , your feedback , don’t need that
my crew rode , and see hoes at each show
scream i love you don’t know them
