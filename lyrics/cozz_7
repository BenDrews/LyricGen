uh , got the whole city goin' crazy for me , whole world waitin' on me
way i been recordin' lately , i'll be retired by the age of 40
can't ignore me , you is just a hater if you hatin' on me
y'all can quit playin' , bitches sayin' " why you single cody ? "
cause i'm tryna stack my pringles , shorty , i ain't fuckin' wit' you hoes
probably get a nigga killed , either that or be on maury
rather sit back , smoke a sack or just drink a 40
man , this can't be life , this ain't seemin' real
i'm closer to my dreams and fantasy of chills on my skin
gunnin' for them niggas claiming that they got the game on lock
all jokes aside i'm about to grab the key and peel
diabetes shield , somebody sweet talk me , i don't need a deal
rap hard , add my signature , i need at least a mil'
i'm tryna feed the children , tryin' to make at least killing
crimes i at least repent , no snitchin'
pigs make people squeal , keep it real
niggas makin' it with connects and just decent skill
so with this type of hunger y'all ain't shit but some easy meals
feelin' greasy still , holla at your boi
name a nigga better than me , you ain't got one
i don't tell 'em that i'm sick , i let the snot run
i was poppin' on twitter 'fore a nigga even got one
man , the whole world waitin' on a nigga
got the whole city goin' crazy for me
got the whole world waitin' for a nigga
got the whole city goin' crazy for me
i got the whole city goin' crazy for me
i got the whole city goin' crazy for me
i got the whole world waitin' on a nigga

i got the whole city goin' crazy for me

damn , uh
hard to get grades to get into college where part of it is the party
and part of all the officers , tell 'em to get up off of us
picked it up from anonymous , no , we not snitchin'
man , i'm 20 years old with the tolerance of a 40 year old father with a slut
daughter with a son that couldn't get to no colleges
what the fuck is you actin' fantastic for ?
it ain't a thing for me to get to clobberin'
nobody slobberin' like how cozz is spittin'
niggas is trippin' , niggas is pimpin'
niggas ain't gettin' no business , niggas is slippin'
