it's the females that be hanging
it's the females who be hanging
all of this for a necklace ? all of this for a lexus ?
all of that for attention , you been through a lot i'm guessin'
a lot of drama at school , coulda sworn it was more electives
his parents did a lot of yellin'
coulda sworn it was more effective
over here you better have brains or be a western ave. slave
get beat by your master when you can't behave
only thing they got in common , they tryna get paid
see money is a thang , cause i know with money i could make that porm pussy purr quick
but i ain't worth shit , she don't look to a god
it's a man that she worships
cause the man keep her afloat , as if they were ships
but you gotta think about the bigger picture
i know that nigga hit ya
you don't deserve that type of shit
you a queen , you a god , you a perfect type chick
i got this weed , i'll roll it up
i know you'd like a hit , i know you'd like a hit
you be stressin' like a motherfucker
i know you been stressin' baby , nothin' but a western slave
chasin' that paper baby , nothin' but a western slave
i know you feel the pressure baby , but don't let it get you baby
nothin' but a western slave , we nothin' but western slaves
i swear i can't die alone , man i can't die alone
promise to hold my hand while he's at my head with the chrome
i swear i ain't done no wrong , but shit we all done some wrong
but does that mean i should go ? shit , too late baby , i'm gone
it happens just like that , you could go in an instant
momma always told me to make better decisions and i still ain't learned my lesson
i'm probably kicked out the house with no place to crash at , in need of an intersection
better yet it's best i start from scratch , so i sleep with the dogs to get flea infested
been itchin' and sniff a kitten in order to sneeze , just to get a blessin'
we all be stressin' , that ain't no question
no judgin' , just progression
live and learn lessons , burn herb essence
fuck the bullshit , we laugh tryna have a good time
before we all die , baby we all go through hard times
i know you been stressin' baby , nothin' but a western slave
chasin' that paper baby , nothin' but a western slave
i know you feel the pressure baby , but don't let it get you baby
nothin' but a western slave , we nothin' but western slaves
yo , cozz & effect nigga
yeah , you fall , you get up
you fly , you stay high , yeah
you do what make you happy
