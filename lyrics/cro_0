even though i
on my way , on my way , on my way down
on my way , on my way , on my way down
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun , know you know i find my way back 'round
they tell me i should fix my grill , ‘cause i got money now
i ain't gon' sit around and front like i ain't thought about it
a perfect smile is more appealing , but it's funny how
my shit is crooked – look at how far i done got without it !
i keep my twisted grill , just to show the kids it's real
we ain't picture perfect , but we worth the picture still
i got smart , i got rich , and i got bitches still
and they all look like my eyebrows ; thick as hell
love yourself , girl , or nobody will
though you a woman i don't know how you deal
with all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
i feel for you , killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
you wake up , put makeup on , stare in the mirror
but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
no need to fix what god already put his paintbrush on
your roommate yelling , " why you gotta take so long ? ! "
what it's like to have a crooked smile
on my way , on my way , on my way down
on my way , on my way , on my way down ( this crooked smile )
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun , know you know i find my way back 'round
to all the women with the flaws , know it's hard , my darling
you wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
you keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
and when i tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you asking
so all you see is what you lacking , not what you packing
take it from a man that loves what you got
and baby girl , you a star , don't let 'em tell you you're not
now is it real ? eyebrows , fingernails , hair
is it real ? if it's not , girl , you don't care
‘cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
that the hands can’t touch , that them broads can’t be
and that’s you , never let 'em see your frown
and if you need a friend to pick you up , i’ll be around
and we can ride with the windows down , the music loud
i can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
but i wanna see that crooked smile
on my way , on my way , on my way down
on my way , on my way , on my way down
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun , know you know i find my way back 'round
crooked smile , we can style on 'em ( back 'round )
crooked smile , we can style on 'em
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun , know you know i find my way back 'round
we don't look nothing like the people on the screen
you know , the movie stars , picture perfect beauty queens
but we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
look at the nation , that’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
seem like half the race is either on probation
or in jail , wonder why we inhale
‘cause we in hell already , i asked if my skin pale
would i then sell like eminem or adele ?
but one more time for the 'ville
and fuck all of that beef shit , nigga , let’s make a mil
hey officer man , we don’t want nobody getting killed
just open up that cell , let my brother outta jail
i got money for the bail now , i'm well now
if you asking will i tell now – ayy , hell nah
i ain’t snitching ‘cause man , they get them niggas stitches now
if you was around , then you wouldn’t need a witness now
how you like this crooked smile ?
on my way , on my way , on my way down
