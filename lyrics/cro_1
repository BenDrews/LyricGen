they can't keep a good man down
always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
they will never ever take my crown
who jah bless i say no man curse
things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse
here comes the officers askin' for a search
they found no weapon just only a draw of herbs
you in the presence of a king
scratch that , you in the presence of a god
put in the belly of the beast
i escaped , a nigga never had a job
scott boras , you over baby
robinson cano , you coming with me
these niggas like rotary phones
it's a new day , hit up kd
niggas always try to knock a nigga down
knock me to my knees about a million times
uncle said i'll never sell a million records
i sold a million records like a million times
these niggas shouldn't let me in
i ball so hard on espn
see my name come across on cnn
'bout 6 minutes , you gonna see it again
'bout 6 minutes , you gonna see me again
shit on me , these niggas tried to shit on me
i was left for dead , they tried to wipe me out of your history
shit on me , these niggas tried to shit on me
i was left for dead , they tried to wipe me out of they history
if fear is your only god
get y'all to fear me is my only job
crown , crown
crown , crown
bulletproof glass , glass roof like the pope
bulletproof love , niggas down since the yolk
bitch asked if i was god , fuck i'm supposed to say no ?
you already seen me turn a man to a g.o.a.t
you already know what i could do with the coke
dropped it in the water , made it disappear
i made it reappear , i had that bitch on a rope
i make my roof get ghost , bottom grill , i make my tooth get gold
all the shit i did , i wasn't supposed to live , hallelujah hov
wasn't for the 'caine wouldn't be able
wasn't for the bread , probably be dead
best friends become ya enemies , niggas' knives are double - edged
shit on me , these niggas tried to shit on me
i was left for dead , they tried to wipe me out of your history
shit on me , these niggas tried to shit on me
i was left for dead , they tried to wipe me out of they history
