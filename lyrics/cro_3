but he keepin' me safe and in my place
say grace to the gates we race
without a chance to face the judge

'cause i know i might meet you up at the crossroads
y'all know , y'all forever got love from them bone thugs , baby

but when it's time to die , gotta go , bye bye
all a lil' thug could do was cry , cry

in front of his home , what they did to boo was wrong
oh so wrong , was so wrong
