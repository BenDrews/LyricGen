yo , let me take you to the tribe real quick
i'm from that small city called panorama
where the vatos roam and they blast they hammers
never had no sense , so i'm bad with manners
who'd've thought i'd be livin' life in the flashin' cameras ?
got bitches on my nuts like pubics ( ooh ! )
niggas could never figure me out like rubik's ( cubes )
i be bullyin' everybody like i'm brutus ! ( who ? )
so don't underestimate me , i do this , truest
i'm calm and ill but still drop bombs , i kill
you know the deal , with my godly skills
you wanna jog the field in my shoes ? there's a lot to fill
it won't happen , you cannot be real
man , there's so many rappers that wanna catch my fade
so many bitches that wanna snatch my brain
i'll probably end up on the news , dead , bullet in the head
mama in the street yellin' : " that's my baby ! "
you want me to keep it to a minimal with the syllables ?
i think you should get up off my genitals
every nigga identical when they spit a flow , this shit is critical
i'ma have to get rough and get all my sentinels
nigga , what you be sippin' on ? i'm guessin' your pen is broke
is it difficult for you to get better ? you're so despicable
'cause your shit is boo - boo , your bars are predictable
i do not bump it , it's hard to get into you
please admit it , man , the voyage is radical
mind is set to just destroy , i'm an animal
killin' shit , man , i'm a poisonous antidote
i be on it , man , your boy's international
yeah , i'm mad with rhymes
been doin' this since '99 , i'm a mastermind
homie , it's 2015 , and all my niggas gon' kill it
when they finish the job , the other half is mine
fool , you ain't on that real shit
i live here , you on a field trip
i'm made of shit you ain't built with
you a bitch , yo' girl need a real dick
it's no doubt niggas gon' feel this
you don't scare niggas , not even a little bit
i serve you , you get the bill quick
crown me , i'm a real prince
give me that crown boy ! ( give it ! )
i said " give me that shit ! "
give me that crown boy ! ( c'mon ! )
i said " give me that shit ! "
give me that crown boy ! ( give it ! )
i said " give me that shit ! "
give me that crown boy ! ( c'mon ! )
give me that shit !
the rap game's mine , i revolve it 'round me
i think i have lost it , and my mind's exhausted
i'm nauseous from the process
of hoppin' on stage and tryin' to dive in moshpits
nigga , why you focused on diamonds ?
these cubic zirconia's all up in my ear
over jewelry , i don't get excited
my perception in life is " why the fuck am i here , nigga ? "
i've been this way since your ass has been suckin' on titties
since niggas cocked back and start bustin' on 50
since j - lo was mobbin' in public with diddy
since biggie and pac got shot up , it's a pity
that bullshit you're talkin' , i'm not in the mood , bro
continue yappin' , you'll see hopsin is brutal
keep pushin' me , you gon' get dropped with some judo
you fannin' out like you want cock in yo' culo
niggas only in it for money and bitches
i don't even think they wanna rap no more
but they wanna be all over the television
rockin' feminine shit , tryin' to act homo
old bi - ass niggas can't bypass niggas
" i can't change even if i tried " - ass niggas
tight jeans on so they show yo' ass - ass niggas
in the pool with the homie , tryin' to splash - ass niggas
fruity as mike and ike , you'll get diced to rice
when i arrive i pull up like " hi ! surprise ! "
it might be wise to hide when the nightly skies are high
fuckin' with an ape ; no life of pi
tell me , what position would the game be in
without me havin' the ability to rape the pen ?
pound syndrome , this is it , i'm weighin' in
i still hate y'all niggas and i can't pretend
fool , you ain't on that real shit
i live here , you on a field trip
i'm made of shit you ain't built with
you a bitch , yo' girl need a real dick
it's no doubt niggas gon' feel this
you don't scare niggas , not even a little bit
i serve you , you get the bill quick
crown me , i'm a real prince
give me that crown boy ! ( give it ! )
i said " give me that shit ! "
give me that crown boy ! ( c'mon ! )
i said " give me that shit ! "
give me that crown boy ! ( give it ! )
i said " give me that shit ! "
give me that crown boy ! ( c'mon ! )
give me that shit !
