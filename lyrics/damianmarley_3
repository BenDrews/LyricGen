all i do is stay focused
looking straight forward at the world and beyond
i feel people pulling me down
i feel some pulling me up
i can't get stuck
i just keep moving forward
i got places to go man
let's go
when the armageddon's dark and dread
a lot of weak hearted weep and moan
only the strong will continue
do you have it in you ?
come , we've got a journey to go
and when the battle get sour and dread
a lot of weak hearted wither and moan
only the strong will continue
i know you have it in you
i know you have it in you
hey , the victory's found in truth
like innocence found in youth
self defeat is your own dispute
and man , you put yourself in your own shoes
either you're winning or losing
don't you get it confused
play a star and you know your own movie
playing of the role you choose , so
stand up and fight if you know that you're right
and know you will never fail
tipping the scale and the wind shall prevail
and the boat shall forever sail
hey , there ain't no stopping or cruising
even when you're battered and bruised
outrun all the sprinters on mount olympus
my god's tougher than zeus
when the armageddon's dark and dread
( i get up and make it happen )
a lot of weak hearted wither and moan
( i get up and we get it cracking )
only the strong will continue
do you have it in you ?
come , we've got a journey to go
and when the battle get sour and dread
( i get up and i get it going )
a lot of weak hearted wither and moan
( we get up and we keep it flowing )
only the strong will continue ( yeah )
i know you have it in you ( yeah , yeah )
i know you have it in you
as i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
new york to cali , for the money , power , respect
it's a journey , some'll get left behind
cause in life , you cannot press rewind
get it right , you only have one first chance
to make one first impression that lasts a lifetime
reputation supersedes itself
do you believe in hell ? babylon greed for wealth
do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell ?
and disregard those who most need your help
thick skin , the dark won't take my soul
survive spiritual wars , see my welts
and the evil's felt , but the faith is stronger
i saw grown men fall when i was a youngster
but i clench my fists , ready to go against whoever
tie my timbs and rise in the end
when the armageddon's dark and dread
( i get up and make it happen )
a lot of weak hearted weep and moan
( i get up and we get it cracking )
only the strong will continue
do you have it in you ?
come , we've got a journey to go
and when the battle get sour and tread
( i get up and i get it going )
a lot of weak hearted wither and moan
( we get up and we keep it flowing )
only the strong will continue ( yeah )
i know you have it in you ( yeah , yeah )
i know you have it in you
no man live forever , but never say never
every good he want better , must be a go getter
and always be clever in every endeavor
cause drastic time call for drastic measure
yuh birthright to pleasure from yuh navel string sever
the land and the treasure , work for whatever
jah said don't be a beggar , the alpha omega
will bless every soul no matter which name you prefer
the immortal stepper , believe in every skin no matter which color they are
we never let we don't know here which kind of weather
you're destined to rise like the son of rebecca
don't stop for a second
everyone reckon , it sure would be good to be there
whether zion or mecca
when the gates are finally closed
and the saints go marching in
i'm a street lifer
always harrassed by the cee cyphers
chief like geronimo with his peace pipe
i emerged from the street life
this for the homies who relate
know what it be like
my qb life takin' a turn to the louis xiii life
twisted and mangled sort of like bruce lee life
cursed with his son brandon
if that's you and me , knight , i pray our fates greater
i speak life i still matter as a rapper , not doubtin'
even toni braxton signed a deal with craig kallman
how in , the hell am i supposed stay comfy
when i pay child support , alimony monthly ?
got maseratis and ferraris
only like a woman who's a rider , but only ho's want me
single life crazy , niggas wives on me
i say stay faithful , they say their man corny
so i'm , stuck with a married woman
so fine , cheatin while they husband
rushing on the 40 - yard line , wonder if
this is what my ex did the whole time
good niggas seem to always end up
with some hard times , hope not
if a pimp slippin and a ho plot
ain't nothin to a g in a two - tone drop , kid
and it don't stop , see a nigga dissapearin
with the baddest honeys in the whole spot , yeah
