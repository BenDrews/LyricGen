these later days in babylon as i watch your children grow
and the years them carry on and i miss you even more
still i send them go to school and tell them
what dem fi know
all of mi friend dem mi salute , daddi gon lenny screw
another year has come and past , man a drop like morning dew
uncle warrick sick and gone when him couldn't catch a flu
picka t you a mi don , respect long and overdue
when nothing never did a gwan you still have on somethin' new
our friendship ever last all when one minus from few
yes we surely had a blast , we're like family me and you
a nuh every path you cross lead to somebody whe true
of the many that are called only chosen is a few
of the real friends that serve you long
your memories might fade
your real friends will serve you long
sunshine or rain
your real friends will serve you long
acquaintances will fade
your real friends won't do you wrong
real friend don't change
only talking with winners , a loser or two got my number
still they think they real but they just really awfully bitter
salty niggas hate the smarter ones , these are the doubters
who sour 'bout my run , i barely made it out the slums
my value high 'cause i do more than rap about a gun
i made money for niggas , y'all never looking out for none
i helped millionaires get to that very position
some real millionaires see that's ill 'cause look at statistics
real millionaires and i ain't talking ghetto riches , thorough business
you mistreating niggas , heard your folks bleed in prison
you ain't a g and if you was i don't recall
who would roll with y'all , bunch of fucking know it alls who's dough is small
look what's it come to our rapport's good no more
we was good before till i saw what type a dude you took me for
we had a chance to take paper down , what i took was more
because of hatred , opportunity wasted
your real friends will serve you long
your car and clothes will fade
your real friend won't do you wrong
real friend don't change eh
your real friend won't run in war nuh care what the cost is
you real friends are in for all the wins and the losses
fi real ! no question at all them ready fi rise the tallest
take to the enemies all for one and one for all this
real friend will hear you out , no secret feelings
real friends won't sell you out , no bargain pleading
for real , always looking out a meal
when outside a drought your real friend won't hide you out , no
your real friends will serve you long
when all else fails
your real friend won't do you wrong
real friend don't change
may laughter from backstabbers turn to tears faster
i wish for you no snake shall slither past ya you have to
keep your vision clear cause only a coward lives in fear
my surroundings got only real powerful niggas here
real men we have a code of ethics , no question
no jealousies , no feminine tendencies , we expecting
no gossip , no phony logic , no counting your homey pocket
spare no expense for legal defense if your homey locked up
no keeping tabs on who was the last who looked out
selfishness that's a character flaw , no holding out
yo what happened to the honor , you're dealing withsensitive primadonna drama
teflon love for my dudes who solid
your real friends will serve you long
your memories might fade
your real friends will serve you long
sunshine or rain , eh
your real friends will serve you long , woe ya woe
when all else fails
your real friends won't do you wrong

now plentiful
or scantily
my cup be full
or emptily
with arm in arms
we'll all trod on
through destiny
a friend that's true
is there for me
respect is due
they care for me
should i be down
or even out
they're next to me
