as we enter
come now we take you on the biggest adventure
must be dementia , that you ever thought
you could touch our credentials , what's the initials ?
q.b. , jamrock the lyrical official
send out the order , laws and the rituals
burn candles , say prayers , paint murals
it is truth we big news , we hood heroes
break past the anchor , we come to conquer
man a badman , we no play willy wonka
and i got the guns i got the ganja
and we could blaze it up on your block if you want to
or haze it up stash box in a hummer
or you could run up and get done up
or get something that you want none of
unlimited amount you collect from us
direct from us , street intellectuals
and i'm shrewd about decimals
and my man'll speak patois
and i can speak rap star
y'all feel me even if it's in swahili
habari gani mzuri sana
switch up the language and move to ghana
salute and honor , real revolution rhymers
rhythm piranhas like two obamas unfold the drama
word is out , hysteria you heard about
nas and jr. gong gonna turn it out
body the verse until they scream " murder " out
the kings is back , time to return the crown
who want it ? tuck your chain , when dude coming
renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
bet your jewels on it , you don't want to lose on it
either move on or move on it
queens to kingston
gunshot we use and govern the kingdom
rise of the winston , i can see the fear up in your eyes
realize you can die any instant
and i can hear the sound of a voice
when you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen
snitching , i can see him pissing on hisself
and he's wetting up his thighs and he trying to resist it
switching , i can smell him digging up shit like a fly
come around and be persistent
that's how you end up in a hit list
in a bad man business
no evidence crime scene , fingerprint - less
flow effortless casual like the weekends
no pressure when we're comfy and decent
we set this off beasting hunting season
and , frankly speaking
word is out , hysteria you heard about
nas and jr. gong gonna turn it out
body the verse until they scream " murder " out
the kings is back , time to return the crown
who want it ? tuck your chain , when dude coming
renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
bet your jewels on it , you don't want to lose on it
either move on or move on it
