don't wait until the morning
don't wait until the light hits the cracks in the floor
been living in the flight path
not perfect but it's all that we can afford
i spent the whole day working
been trying to pin these dreams to the wings of a check
don't wait until the morning
so tired but i don't want to go to sleep yet
i've been killing myself to make the dead man's dollar
been killing myself to make the dead man's dollar
been killing myself , killing myself
'cause i want to make a life , make a life for you
i , i want to make a , i , i want to make a , i do
yeah , i want to make a life , make a life for you
i , i want to make a , i , i want to make a , i do
yeah , i want to make a life , make a life for you
i want to make a life , but i want to live there too
i know this isn't easy
you got that baby sleeping all by yourself
feels like i'm always leaving
i swear to god , one day i'll be there to help
'til then , i've been killing myself to make the dead man's dollar
been killing myself to make the dead man's dollar
been killing myself , killing myself
'cause i want to make a life , make a life for you
