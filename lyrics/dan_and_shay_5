i'm a man in heat , so i sever seas
and i let it be , steadily , in my random access memory
smoking blue dream , the kush trees are loud
but i gotta call up gabriel to take my devil out
gotta stay live in color , live in color mayne
sick of the same thing every single simple day
mistaken for ray j , but i always came out second
never tried to be the first cuz it hurt and humble's a blessing
i'm just an outcast in the year 3000
you may be talking big , but boy , you're just loud man
drinking from the fountain , of youth - the truth
is in my new - eyes , sublime , i climb on top of mountains
now i'm sitting stuck in a reckless battalion
waiting for a medallion , i can't even keep up with my own stallion
i'm rallying the joints , appoint the best , i'm stressed
depressed , no less , unless , i am put to rest
keeping the spirit alive , can't even think of a crime , mind sublime
stuck in a pickle of time , not for the run but the rise , i'm gonna fight
pine trees , but nicely unwinding , no ivory
pretty sad , how i was so bad , but none of y'all seen what i've seen
feeling a villanous way , i blame dank and shank tanks
i arrange my painkillers in place of grade a
still searching for answers , they're not inside my wrists
so i gotta find them elsewhere before my chance is missed
screw the depression and screw the stress , i need a blessing
perception of my inception , i'm still dreaming but not resting
i'm dressed up in a vest though and i'm living in a coffin
it's like i'm peter preston , i've been pressed in cause i'm coughing
iron lung attached cause i mow the grass
the dope in sacks intact , i rolled the hash
i think it's finally time for some bloody photosynthesis
now witness this , soon i will be the king of bliss
