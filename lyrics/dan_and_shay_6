papa brought flowers for mama today
and all the grown children , but it's not mother's day
i don't have no money , not even a dime
but i brought mama flowers like i have all the time
everyday i pick flowers from this pretty hill
a small box of daisies and a few daphidilles
i bring them to mama at the end of the day
and say flowers for mama , here's mama's bouquet
they brighten her face and she holds me close
she'd say they are more precious than a beautiful rose
and she wore a smile sweeter than millions of flowers
a smile that i'll carry through lifes darkest hours
spoken :
now mama was lying there , yes , they tell me she passed away
and she was surrounded by flowers that outshined my bouquet
i know mine aren't fancy but still all the while
they were placed in her hand and i know i saw mama smile
sang :
flowers for mama i picked them today
not very much , just a simple bouquet
mom wasn't so fancy but up there above
she's the prettiest flower in god's garden of love
