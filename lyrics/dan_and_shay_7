fully loaded , fully loaded
pull up in that candy coated
i can't leave the house i'm smoking
that's my songs boy you stole it
think about i used to move them bands praying i could move the o zips
do you know what cold is , my eye seen it all
froze a nigga , shout out coodie breeze , all my niggas ball
" easy hit me up , i'm tryna work "
i can't even call
all these niggas soulja boy's , i can't fuck with y'all
too much sodium , salties can't stand in my podium
gutted how young easy go so dumb , i'm the chosen one
on my mama i ain't win a hundred , i do this for fun
killing all these rappers sitting down , i might roll a blunt
niggas look down at the god i do not look up
if you lazy boy you is a clown , get up and get you some
i be in the field kissing babies , dapping niggas up
young easy for mayor of atlanta , man i might just run
i'ma keep it rolling ( x4 )
i'ma keep on rolling
i'm gon' keep on rolling ( x3 )
i'm gon' keep it moving ( x7 )
whatchu' niggas doing
i'ma keep it moving
i'ma keep it moving
what the hell you doing
cause i'ma keep it moving
i'ma keep it real
i'ma keep it true
i'ma keep it all the things i know that you can't do
i'ma keep it moving
i'ma keep it moving
i'ma change the world
don't believe me , man watch me do it
your raps made me hurl
heard your album i ain't going through it
i could take your girl , i'm gon' chill though i ain't gon' prove it
pull that strap on me , in my heart i knew he weren't gon' shoot it
i'm a stand up guy from atlanta
keep that hammer
all my guns in my name
came straight out the porche
had to take it as a blessing
all my niggas did that dirt , now tell them no stressing
that's how a nigga came in from the bottom
niggas talking ford's , but i want that old model
rip bankroll , man we lost a role model
on that open road , 'bout to hit that open throttle
i'ma keep it rolling ( x4 )
i'ma keep on rolling
i'm gon' keep on rolling ( x3 )
i'm gon' keep it moving ( x7 )
whatchu' niggas doing
i'ma keep it moving
i'ma keep it moving
what the hell you doing
cause i'ma keep it moving
i'ma keep it sweet
i'ma keep it right
i'ma keep it going all day and stay up all night
i'ma keep it moving
i'ma keep it moving
