so a buddy comes up to one day , and says
" yo , you want to go to a movie ? "
and i'm like
" yeah , but just one thing... no homo ! "
so i'm at the movies
when this square comes up
bumps into me , and grazes my dick
and i say , " listen here you prick !
you can do all that shit at home on your own
but i simply will not tolerate it in my zone !
i'll ask one thing of you , pal
is this homo ? "
and he said to me , " nah , sorry man
i'm just walking to my seat
i got a family to feed "
and i'm like , " sounds pretty homo to me
i will ask you again , homo or no homo ? "
i feel like everywhere i walk
somebody wants to touch my cock
i feel so uncomfortable
with all these homosexuals
people call me a bozo
i'm just not a homo
i went to the park
i just wanted it to be a relaxing day
i sat down on a bench
when suddenly , some guy walks up and asks
" hey man , is that seat taken ? "
and i'm like
" what are you trying to get into my ass or something ? "
and he didn't say anything back
he just gave me a really weird look
wow , what a homo
i feel like everywhere i walk
somebody wants to touch my cock
i feel so uncomfortable
with all these homosexuals
people call me a bozo
i'm just not a homo
i was looking a nice bar
to relax with my friends
all i could find was a place downtown
that seemed to be rather rundown
so i there headed looking for a good time
that's not what i got
when i walked in
i saw a bunch of shirtless guys
nothing weird about that
one of them came up to me , and said
" hey , after tonight , you'll be filled with my love "
and i replied
" okay , but first i gotta know
this is gonna be no homo ? "
and he said
" of course not , if you don't want it to be "
after that night , my sexuality's been fully realized
i'm gay
i feel like everywhere i walk
somebody wants to avoid my cock
i feel so uncomfortable
with all these heterosexuals
people call me a bozo
i'm just not a hetero
no homo
