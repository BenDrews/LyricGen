exile on the hill
gardener in the mire
you're diggin' up a swamp
he's rising from the field
a mess of gold and green
nightmare in the mud
there you are
there you are
there you are
there you are
brat on borrowed ground
poser in the grass
tell us what you've learned
forbidding silent walls
the beast out in the bog
sing a mournful song
silent song ( is this what you want ? )
silent song ( is this how you'd have it ? )
silent song ( is this what you want ? )
silent song ( is this how you'd have it )
never fear
i know there's work here to redeem you
still , it's clear
there's not a word , a word that could save you
if i had a chance to see
the friends i've loved and lost
i'd beg for their return
il dig until i bleed
drink until i rot
lord i know it's wrong
so help me on ( is this what you want ? )
help me on ( is this how you'd have it ? )
help me on ( is this what you want ? )
help me on ( is this how you'd have it ? )
help me on
help me on
