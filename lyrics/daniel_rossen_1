denied , a life in retreat
living on your knees
it's alright , you're still light on your feet
but you can't run from me
another silent hour , another golden mile
another silent hour , another golden mile
another empty heart , another bitter smile
another silent hour , another golden mile
no fight , there's no crushing defeat
it's a lie run free
those lies , they're precious to me
come along , leave me be
for a silent hour , for a golden mile
for a silent hour , for a golden mile
there is bliss in this mess
there is madness all around
for a silent hour , for a golden mile
say the words , break the spell
say the words , break the spell
say the words in your mind
before you shout out loud
