a new day
starts now
don’t avert your eyes
the greatest
distance
between opposing skies
a pristine
pasture
it’s a long drive across town
and we’re out for the night
we left for hours
dancing on the trail
a feet heavy on the ground
right before me
slowly , slowly
so hung up , couldn’t speak for days
so cut loose , should’ve blown away
into the night
all around me
slowly , slowly
the dream came once , may come again
a new day
starts now
don’t avert your eyes
the greatest
distance
between opposing skies
it’s just a matter of perspective
just a passing age
some stretch of time
lost in friendly self - reflection
what an open mind
unfollow the line
that wanders through the mire
we walked for hours
no appointed place
just a walk around town
slowly , slowly
slowly , slowly
a quiet start to a quiet day
and find your voice before it slips away
into the ground
all around me
all around me
