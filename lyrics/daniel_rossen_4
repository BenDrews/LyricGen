lift
lift your head
myth
so pristine
and white with age
walk with me
speak to me
saint
i don't know your name
but your voice so strong
speaks through the glass
speaks through the ground
an empty phrase
a hollow sound
calm
quite severe
leave the throng
a mind so clear
you feel no pain
an end so near
you taste the blood
how long ?
how long ?
how long ?
how long ?
