you're crossing a river
to put it between us
wide in the night
and everyone sees it
even my mother
she asks after you
and i'm your defender
my sword and my shield
laid at your feet
'cause you're only trying
with every waking breath
to do all you can do
with all that you have left
indelicate angels who whisper their secrets loud as a gun
and beautiful strangers who live in their jewelry
dying for love
i wish you could meet them in all of their glory
i know then you'd see
that they're only trying
with every waking breath
to do all they can do
with all that they have left
you're crossing a river
to put it between us
wide in the night
and all that i can do
is go to the water
and hold up a light
i know that you're thinking with every backstroke :
why ?
but i'm only trying
with every waking breath
to do all i can do
with all that i have left
