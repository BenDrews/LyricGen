i've heard the waterfall roarin' again
since i've been lovin' you
with my poor heart in my throat , i begin
livin' the dream come true
tumblin' down comes the water
ticklin' every stone
on the edge tremblin' , i taught her
my fate unknown
but my fear has flown
and your love comes to lead us home
from a small trickle it grows
watchin' , i wait enthralled
for the momentum to carry us off
over the rushing falls
tumblin' down comes the water
tickling every stone
pass the suns rays growing hotter
the cascade drones
through glistening fall
your love comes to lead us home
since dawn has shown
one night's overthrown
your love comes to lead us home
i've heard the waterfall roarin' again
since i've been lovin' you...
