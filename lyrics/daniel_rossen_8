have you lost your mind ?
i was miles away
i was miles away
or did you find it ?
they were not around
not a soul for miles
when you returned
couldn't say the word
couldn't speak a sound
when will you come home ?
not until i'm done
not until my name turns into dust
so , you're not coming back ?
so , you're never coming back ?
well , you're easily forgone
find the words to your last bitter song
and get it off your mind
get it off your mind
reaching on , past these dark busted towns
lazy down the line
still , they line the road
what's to say this is all we've got left ?
let it lay a while
let me lie in rest , down in the dust
no , they're not coming back
no , they're never coming back
they're not easily forgone
