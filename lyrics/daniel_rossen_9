you can refuse me , but you can't just turn me away
better contain myself , better just sit here and wait
i'll try to please you , and i'll try to mend what we made
yeah , mend what we break , and make it alright
blinded , excited , i hit myself right in the eye
stumbling fool , oh your gibberish churning inside
i can't remember you , i can't , but it's still alright
no , never too late , to make it alright
what we're running towards , babe , i don't know how to say
what's the idea in the first place in running away
but i'll follow you babe , i'll follow , wherever you want
yeah , wherever you want , and make it in time
