30 !
colder than them grits they fed slaves
me to rap is like water to raves
ak's with bayonets on deck , rep my set
sorta like squidward and his clarinet
i'm in ya bitch mouth but she fantasizing
staring at the skinnies , said it's so tantalizing
dog i'm strategizing , plotting on the throne
the masta of the ace sitting on chrome
dark nights tryna sleep stomach on fire
delusional from hunger so i couldn't get tired
imagining the equalizer goin' from green to red
words that rhyme together just appear all in my head
and i'm sorta like neo with the matrix code
i try to escape it hoping the drugs'll numb my soul
say i'm getting old and time's running out
repeating instrumentals , tryna figure patterns out
i never leave the house , ain't slept in three days
popping pills , writing , drinking and smoking haze
weaving kicks and snares , tryna dodge these hooks
keepin' it original , something that's overlooked
the way a nigga going might go out like sam cooke
or locked up calling home for money on my books
'cause if this shit don't work , nigga , i failed at life
turning to these drugs , now these drugs turned my life
and it's the downward spiral , got me suicidal
but too scared to do it so these pills will be the rifle
surpassing all my idols , took the wrong turn
but can't go back now so let that blunt burn
'cause now it's my turn if i fuck it all up
took a while to get here now i depend on these drugs
i took a while to get here now i depend on these drugs
