you niggas donâ€™t even know
all that talk then no show
cannot tell me nothin'
show me somethin' i ain't seen before
that hoe want my piccolo
smoking on that mistletoe
make her kiss all on it
while we chop chop on them 24s
she look like a centerfold
mouth all on my genitals
suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals
i be on the chemicals , she be on my testicles
poke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules
rolling up them vegetables
rapping with that special flow
only way you're next to blow if you be strapped with c4
i be fresh from head to toe , every day a fashion show
used to tote that calico and serve like john mcenroe
now i sell out all my shows
used to sell out all my blow
that was back when we was coppin' dubs to try and roll up 4
now a nigga livin' good
i done made it out the hood
think i'm goin' back ?
i wish a motherfucker would
yeah , they say i got the city on fire
i ain't boomin' , that's a goddamn lie , woah
really doe , like really doe
really doe , like really doe
they say i got the city on fire
i ain't boomin' , that's a goddamn lie , woah
really doe , like really doe
really doe , like really doe
still wicked as aleister , crowley niggas know me well
for heaven's sake , i'm the goat , you haters can go to hell
when you're getting money , nigga , every day is sunny
i'ma act an ass on that donkey , let her pull my ponytail
second grade , took my mama weddin' ring , took that bitch
to show - and - tell , now i'm married to the game to no avail
grounded me for like a month , now i'm gettin' high as fuck
employer tryna write me up , but now i'm a writer
with ambitions of a rider , and half the shit on my rider i don't even want , the fanta's for us , the henny's for the sluts ( chyeah )
givenchy bikers with the rev rips
balmain badmon , bathing ape on my dick
paid by the bloods , raised by the crips
soulo ho3 the prophecies , atrocities , exhibition
oh yeah , now a nigga livin' good
but good could be better i wish a motherfucker would
yeah , they say i got the city on fire
i ain't boomin' , that's a goddamn lie , woah
really doe , like really doe
really doe , like really doe
they say i got the city on fire
i ain't boomin' , that's a goddamn lie , woah
really doe , like really doe
really doe , like really doe
life is like an appetite of truth and dare , i double dare ya
life to end in vain before the end is near
see i can hear you crying
silence sittin' in the dark
holdin' crosses 'cross your heart
sin is such a work of art
watch out for the love lost
bet a thousand , shoot a thousand
things a nigga do for thousands
made a million counting sheep
gave it all to public housin'
taking off to abu dhabi
beamin' up the motor , scotty
talking to promoters , scotty
everybody know it's gotti
murder one , you've heard of them
the rev undid , the all day madness
got it off the wipe it off , the evidence , the blood on mattress
big power , big stages
my zoo cannot fit the cages
this booth is not used to fakin'
my crew just love confrontation
i chewed the face off the laces
i moved the weight from the waitress
i chef the pot that made poison
i cooked then kicked all the patients
my bitch is way beyond basic
that's life insurance , car insurance , good pussy insurance
ayy , look what we're enduring
ayy , ridin' in foreigns
ayy , k - dot , four years , i got the same watch
but it's the real watch and that bitch fire
speed racer waitin' outside
the roof on it like a tank top
countin' money , watchin' paint dry
when i'm done is when the rain stops , uh
they say i got the city on fire
i ain't boomin' , that's a goddamn lie , woah
really doe , like really doe
really doe , like really doe
they say i got the city on fire
i ain't boomin' , that's a goddamn lie , woah
really doe , like really doe
really doe , like really doe
good , hood
i wish you motherfuckin' would
listen , wish a motherfucker would , brown
i had to put my foot down
it's like i'm popping a clutch
your hate palpable , your jaw full of dust
you gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up ?
and i'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge
you a mouse that the falcon picked up
so disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month
i was a liar as a kid so now i'm honest as fuck
and i never pass my mama no blunt
and kept my hair straight
listen deadweight never been a problem to dunk
look , i just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough
i keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle alchemist puff
i strike a birdie on 'em , while i hit your mouth with the club
i wake up early on 'em , gettin' out the house is a must
it's like a sweaty pit , sweaty sick , countin' your dubs
either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks
loungin' , ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts
you've been the same motherfucker since 2001
well it's the left - handed shooter , kyle lowry the pump
i'm at your house like , " why you got your couch on my chucks ? "
motherfucker
