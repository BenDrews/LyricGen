arthritis in her fingers , carpal tunnel in her wrists
'bout to feed her kids at night sit between her legs and twist
while she listen to the oldie soap operas smoking bogies
on the phone gossiping telling homegirls stories
girlfriend worried cause her son's in a hurry
to see the state pen' or a cemetery buried
ma replied do her best but it's still rough
keep your kids off the street and away from drugs
doing hair in the house ain't putting on daniel
daddy in and out , ay , who turned that channel ?
sneakers turn to house shoes , stepping on the back
ashing her cigarette in a brown paper bag
smoking joints , lauging tryna get the part straight
for ten , put your perm in , don't scratch all day
hot cocoa stove , put the food in the bowl
say that's how many nights it was hard to keep going
now i'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
wanna see me dead or locked in a prison
in the system with division only thing that add up
fucked up cause a nigga tryna get a couple bucks
now i'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
wanna see me dead or locked in a prison
in the system with division only thing that add up
fucked up nigga tryna get a couple bucks

if you really wonder why these people got issues

out wilding with my friends , even got myself a biscuit
homie momma smoking with nothing to lose
now he stashing cracks in some hundred dollar shoes
sitting at his crib , smoking swishers , getting faded
told me hit my mommy up , cause he tryna get braided
what we gon' do see the local dope man
see if he can put some money in our hand
same one jump me , the same one front me
cause i'm tired of seeing my family fucked up and hungry
