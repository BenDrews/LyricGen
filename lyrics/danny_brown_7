close my eyes , feel like i'm going down in an elevator at 90 miles an hour
and all i see is stars and they coming at me sort of like a meteor shower
my forehead's sweaty , my eyelids heavy , feeling like i ain't going make it
cause inside my head's like a firework show in the 4th july in las vegas
said , i'm tripping , i'm slipping , feeling like i just can't move
i done took me a couple more pills
next thing i know , i'm taking off my shoes
and i'm on walking on these clouds like marshmallows
nodding off , smelling like rose petals
zoning out , two - three , like the fiend in hell fire and angel wings
i'm conscious to that world , connin science 'bout that world
all these drugs up in me , it's a miracle i ain't mirror kurt
i'm numb like a mortician , going dumb with oakland bitches
they say you hella boosie , roll a backwood up with them cookies
i'm smoking , back to back , back to back , back to back
it's the blunt after blunt rotation
now i'm in a kush coma off the og aroma
and my brain going on vacation
i'm smoking , back to back , back to back , back to back
it's the blunt after blunt rotation
now i'm in a kush coma off the og aroma
and my brain going on vacation
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
get high , my niggas , smoke kush
get fly , my niggas , dope looks
so many numbers in my phone book
i could start a mothafuckin' phone book
know all the fly bitches gonna look
like i'm on something , tell 'em roll something
i'm that one nigga , bumping 2pac
be like three hoes , that's a foursome
fuck niggas always want to hold something
young hot nigga done froze on 'em
went cold on 'em , beat the golds on 'em
and clothes on 'em , see the hoes on 'em ?
only fear god , never sold on him
man , i swear to god , put my soul on him
life's a bitch , but she chose on him
should've died in hell , but i rose on 'em
in big shades , fuck the hypocrites , stop
time let the tats , for the tick , tock
clocks on the wall , fuck your wristwatch
pause , let it stop , hope we get by
bye when i zoom , let it vroom
'bout a hundred goons with a fume , better let it fuse
a hundred miles an hour on the booth , better let it loose
a hundred by the sour , molly , flower , and they love the shrooms
that's real rap , i'm stating facts
contradictions , can't take it back
mommy's stripping , make it clap
in a kush coma , finna take a nap ( i'm out )
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
half asleep with that cotton mouth , weed grow house on plantation
nuggets the size of rakim rings , got my head looking like a fatality screen
got my mind dripping , gotta get away from all this bullshit in my way
knowing goddamn well when the high go away
same shit gon' be still in my way
i'm a slave to the sticky icky , so nigga roll something with me
been smoking blunts since high school
now look at all the bullshit i been through
wanna pass out , but we stayin up , nigga gotta keep one eye open
cause nigga ain't tryna miss the next turn
nigga roll up , then we starting smoking
i'm smoking on that ocho , got my mind on that cosmos
sipping on that purple , got a nigga in slo - mo
dipping in that molly , feel like i'm doing 100 on a harley
tell your baby momma sorry , that was one night and please don't call me
i'm smoking , back to back , back to back , back to back
it's the blunt after blunt rotation
now i'm in a kush coma off the og aroma
and my brain going on vacation
i'm smoking , back to back , back to back , back to back
it's the blunt after blunt rotation
now i'm in a kush coma off the og aroma
and my brain going on vacation
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
kush coma , i am in a kush coma
