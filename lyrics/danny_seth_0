woke up and i'm feeling like the shit
like a piece of motherfucking toilet paper
best thing out my country
no one coming after me like a chaser
and just because i'm breaking overseas
i've got motherfuckers calling me a traitor , fuck
but man'll rep my city so damn hard
like a viagra taker
place your bets , it's time to take your wagers
cause i'm about to blow like hookers for some paper
and if you doubted me , i'll catch you in the future cause i'll see you later
i don't need a helping hand , use it for some masturbating
i've bet now they can see me , me ?
i've got the game locked no key , key
and if you ask your bitch what her favourite letter in my name is
then i'll bet that she say d
woke up and i'm feeling like myself
i don't need nobody's help
i did it on my own two
i don't need nobody's help
i'm feeling like myself
i'm feeling like myself
i woke up , remembered
that i did it by myself
uh , never asking for your help
holding up my city like a fucking trouser belt
london where i'm repping , by my accent you can tell
and i'm always with my clique , rolling deep like adele
uh , molecule is how i smell
bet your bitch wish that she could have me , need a well
wanna hear a story ? well , i've got a few to tell
but i feel i'm spitting fire , there's the warning , there's the bell
i ain't gotta tell you i'mma be the greatest
and i never grew up in the hood , unless it's by my necklace
23 , i nearly completed my checklist
the british coming , i'm the rapping one direction
red ropes wrapped around my private section
fuck you talking bout if i'm not in the conversation ?
never started from the bottom but i wrote this in the basement
i hope i adjusted your perception
woke up and i'm feeling like myself
i don't need nobody's help
i did it on my own two
i don't need nobody's help
i'm feeling like myself
i'm feeling like myself
i woke up , remembered
that i did it by myself
