wonder if you still know me
wonder if you feel lonely
just hoping that you’ll phone me , uh
dear suzanne
this the fifth letter and i'm hoping that you'll phone me
better yet come hold me
find out that my pops moving to spain
this is the reason he told me
he said , “danny sit down take it easy , have a cigarette”
“no i don't need it” he said “i got something that i want to tell you”
i said “what” , he said , “i'm leaving”
i said “when” , he said , “this evening”
“why” , he said , “i’m beefing”
he said , “danny man your step mom and i , we been chalking and cheesin’”
“there must be more of a reason”
he said , “no , danny , trust me just leave it”
if there's one thing that i could tell you it's the two wrongs don't make an even
you know i love that man
before i left i thought you loved him too
then i went to america for 3 months
came back and i heard that you were through
fuck getting into details
i know you don't like me sweating around females
just hoping that this will poke your emotions
and that i wake up with three mails
from a woman i who once called my second mom
fuck three letters please send me one
let me know you're alright
if the dogs are alive or if you want to meet up and have lunch
remember when i was younger
you bought me a red pen
at the time i never thought i would be a writer
and now it all makes sense
you must've seen inside my soul , i was a poet
i wish back then i swear to god i would have known it
that i spent my money on the drugs and women
like a bomb i could have blown it
but now i picked up the same pen
fifth letter but i happily do it again
till you notice i'm here i just hope you're alright let me and within an amen
wonder if you still know me
wonder if you feel lonely
just hoping that you'll phone me so i can be like the old me
just in case you didn't guess
his is your step son , well ex
still love you with all my heart , write back
d. seth
( phone ringing )
hello , danny , darling its me
i got your letter , i didn't get any voicemail , darling
from you , or messages
i want to return you letter with a letter
alright , just send me and address and i mean to write you
godbless , bye
dear danny
i heard you're doing real well
that makes me feel so happy
i always knew that you were a star
who would have thought it be from rapping ?
as for five letters dan , i only ever got one
i split this letter into two stages
and half of it ain't fun
so let me start with the good stuff
got a couple new dogs that you would love
roaming around our wonderful garden
i wish you saw , i know you would if you could , love
t and josh are doing great
they were with me for all the way
but don't worry , danny , cause it's not physical when i tell you that i'm in a lot of pain
and i start to write again
only thing that's making me start to smile again
even though it's been a difficult period
i feel i'm getting back to my life again
i guess i planted the seed
i know this flower leaf
i guess i'm done with the first stage
next bit is going to be difficult to read
where do i start ? i keep getting stuck when i start to write this
cause you know , dan , it's breaking my heart
i can't live a lie , living life like this
unfortunately i've been sick
don't worry because my body is getting better
but my brain on the other hand can't make its mind of like classic english weather
you are not your father
i repeat you are not your father
but association is a powerful thought
in the mind , which makes the next bit harder
part me of staying well is that i got to move forward
i can't see your face no more , it's killing me slow like torture
don’t mean i don't love you
don't want to hug you
don’t mean i don't reminisce about the days i would pick up the phone
and just cry and i know it be fine
cause you'd come through
my darling , my angel
remember me by the way that i raised you
always be the kind soul that i know you are
cause those qualities will make you
and of course i still know you
and sometimes i feel alone , too
i can never get back to myself
and the reason is because i'm without you
don’t you ever forget , i will love you forever on end
even though this message through pen
keep those words till i see you again
