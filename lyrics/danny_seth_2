may the lord forgive all of my haters and all of my doubters
because i've been missing for a minute , maybe a couple of hours
forgive them they do not know what they say my lord , they do not know what they say
so imma pray for them
the british coming , hear the sirens then you better get to running
i'm smelling something , i ain't laughing but i swear your pussy smelling funny
bouncy castle how i got the fucking party jumping all these rappers anesthetic man cause i ain't feeling nothing
this a king's speech , had to spit this motherfucker through my big teeth
tryna take the queen's seat , yeah she sitting on it now but give me like six weeks
after perception nobody gonna question , how i came up quicker than a nymphomaniac erection
yeah i know it's my time i got it down to the second , they calling me the future but i'm feeling like the present
so i took out all my pounds and i made 'em all into dead presidents
best dressed fresh white kid and i flow like my swag man it's reckless
i do it for the young kids who didn't grow up in a hood so now they feel rejected
but this is hip - hop not gangsta rap and so i hope they feel accepted
don't mean i don't know a couple brothers who would poke you like a motherfucking tetanus
and i'm the missing piece in this rapping puzzle brother got me feeling like i'm fucking tetris
no pressure , in my zone no flexing
you acting like a bitch and i'm mad sexist
smoking on a l like a badge of lexus
carrying my city like a necklace
and i ain't going nowhere , motherfucker imma stay here
and imma take my dream over seas while you other man stay here
you ain't gotta worry bout me , worry bout me nah
you ain't gotta worry bout me , worry bout me nah
man you shoulda stayed home
i'm molding other rappers like they're play - doh
md$ and zach nahome
the reason when you hear the beat you turn around and ask your brother " how much pee i gotta pay though ? "
flow so tight it's like an a - hole
and i'm lyrical like j. cole
guess i got the fucking package and the swag to clearly match it pretty flock i want pesos
it's just me and my brothers
all of 'em travel with me like my luggage
skinny and white but my name ain't mclovin
you tryna book me but don't you come with no hundreds
i'm talking racks , ten stacks , hope you hearing what i'm saying like i been tapped
when it comes to rapping i'll embarrass you just like you been slapped
motherfucker take that
see i could do about any of these flows
and i'm wrapping round these rappers like a motherfucking bow
i ain't talking johnny depp but i swear i'm bout to blow
and i'm always getting high , while you hating on the low
i'm the realest one to do it
i ain't been hood but i swear i been through it
and if you rolling with me , roll with me hold my crown bitch while i do this
rip the competition innit
the british are coming
i ain't going nowhere
this a king's speech
