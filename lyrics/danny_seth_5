people all up in my business
how you talkin shit ?
when you ain't got a pot to piss in
see just because you seen my twitter and my youtube glory
that's like reading one page of a book and claim to know the story
started bout 3 years ago , hopped up on a jet
had an internship that's filled with dreams left home with no regrets
landed in america , the land of hope and dreams
then i realized reality dont match the tv screens
so everyone was dreaming i just woke up on my knees
i'm bowing down praying to g - d that i won't ever have to be
suited in front of computers man it wasn't me
see i was born to stand on stage , never to grovel by your feet
never work under a prick who clearly needed therapy who made me work hard day and night and kept on lying through his teeth
well fuck it , man , i quit the job
fuck that fucking prick
so what i did all this for nothing cause my music weren't gettin hits
100 plays a day , i kept refreshing on my soundcloud page
tellin my brother jesse thank you man i swear its worth the wait
harry on the phone , sayin dan forget the hate
never open up cause if you do that day will be your fate
its hard when you be coming from your home with no supporters
you'd assume they'd have your back like the word after a quarter
and i ain't talkin football when i say i'm kickin off
this my chance to show the world that danny deth my only boss
danny seth the only kid who grew the balls and showed them off
i laid my cards out on the table now i'm waitin on the flop
never started from the bottom and i was never at the top
i wrote my stepmom 7 letters now i heard she cut me off
my dad he lives in spain , my sister going through a lot
my mom she tries to keep us together like she tied us by a knot
you think you know my story ? well that shit is just a myth
take a break and concentrate and listen to a lyricist
hooks weren't meant for me
i'm on my green no celery
i swear i got too many bars like a penitentiary
and everybody say they next well no one sittin next to me
i'm kickin all these rappers nuts like a damn vasectomy
there's no ejecting me
i'm kinda comfy like some exit seats
i swear i gone and killed the track , may that fucker rest in beats
how you testin i be the freshest white boy in my section
i got an infectious flow , like my shit never been tested
if having swag was illegal i'd be locked up and arrested
i'm here to stand up for london like a fucking erection
i'm directing the segments of white kids wearing gold necklace
see we were never accepted but nows our time for acceptance
see people telling me to quit , thats on a regular basis
i got some silver in my mouth i ain't talkin bout braces
see those typical white kids who get markedly shitly
they put a snapback on there head and have a puppeteer writing
i'm the newest a breath of fresh air on your chest
i'm gettin done eatin this game man its time to get the check
