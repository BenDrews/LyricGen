uh , tell 'em this what hip hop needs , uh
i grew up in a city
where they never gave a pity or a fuck
unless you're doing grime or uk hip hop
shit , i guess you'll never buss
but i was thinking different
wasn't off the acid but i always had a vision
how i saw the usa was up for acquisition
so i got a pen and pad and jotted down my proposition , uh
the british coming
we did it on our own , no help , no nothing
and as far as pulling through for my city
well , i guess it got me feeling like a plunger
uh , i wonder if they love me or they hate
cause of what i'm wearing instead of digesting what i'm saying
the internet , it has a way to make me look good
and my instagram is looking like a look book
but why the fuck i got more followers on that than on my soundcloud ?
shit is scary , man , it's making suge shook
so i'mma keep my lyrics so clean not even 7 maids will find a speckle of dirt in between
and have the elders playing this shit to their teens and tell em this what hip hop needs
bright lights in my city , i'm dark knight
off a xanee cause i got long flight
i told my baby girl i gotta save the city
cause within my city , man , they call me dark knight
i'm the dark knight of my city
catch me on the block all night
and i ain't worried bout my sinners
they be riding with me till i die
they see me rollin in the streets
so they know it's alright
yeah , i'm the dark knight of my city
catch me on the block all night , on the block all night
this rapping shit , i do it for my city's sake
and i should be a stylist how i changed the game
me and the music , we kinda integrate
i drop a couple bars and rappers then disintegrate
lyrically , i'm punching in a different weight
and fuck the other - side , i serve em like a dinner plate
anyway , let me continue what i was chatting bout
i had a dream to make it overseas
i called my brother jesse , got my clothes
and got my bags and started packing now
he told me it would be alright , i listened
fast forward a couple months and they still doubting
so many ups and downs i feel like i just climbed a mountain
i find it funny how i had a fanbase in the us
before my own people finding out about me
i guess it bothered me but i just kept writing
little do my city know i'm tryna make em shine
for longer than a second like some lightning
it's freighting , the scene up in my city need a viking
to cross the seas and hold the torch up and till it's dying , it's quiet
uh , yeah i swear it's fucking quiet
so now i got the labels offering
my heart is saying no , my wallet saying let em in
then i play my tapes , and they saying " where's the hits ? "
and if i hear that one more time i swear to gosh i'm gonna be sick
they tell me justify the music
tell me what you see
i tell em this what hip hop needs
bright lights in my city , i'm dark knight
off a xanee cause i got long flight
i told my baby girl i gotta save the city
cause within my city , man , they call me dark knight
