come and see
i swear by now i'm playing time against my troubles
oh , i'm coming slow , but speeding
do you wish a dance and while
i'm in the front
the play on time is won
oh , but the difficulty's coming here
i will go in this way
and find my own way out
i won't tell you to begin
but i'm coming to much more
me
all at once , the ghosts come back
reeling in you now
oh , what if they came down crushing ?
remember when i used to play for
all of the loneliness that nobody
notices now
i'm begging slow , i'm coming here
only waiting
i wanted to stay
i wanted to play
i wanted to love you
i'm only this far
and only tomorrow leads the way
i'm coming waltzing back and moving into your head
please
i wouldn't pass this by
oh , i wouldn't take any more than
what sort of man goes by ?
i will bring water
why won't you ever be glad ?
it melts into wonder
i came in praying for you
why won't you run
into the rain and play
and let tears splash all over you ?
