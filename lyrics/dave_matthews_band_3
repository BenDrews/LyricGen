oh , look at how she listens
she says nothing of what she thinks
she just goes stumbling through her memories
staring out onto grey street
she thinks , " hey , how did i come to this ?
i dream myself a thousand times around the world
but i can't get out of this place "
there's an emptiness inside her
and she'd do anything to fill it in
but all the colors mix together - to grey
and it breaks her heart
how she wishes it was different
she prays to god most every night
and though she swears it doesn't listen
there's still a hope in her it might
she says , " i pray
but they fall on deaf ears
am i supposed to take it on myself ?
to get out of this place ? "
there's loneliness inside her
and she'd do anything to fill it in
and though it's red blood bleeding from her now
it feels like cold blue ice in her heart
when all the colors mix together - to grey
and it breaks her heart
there's a stranger speaks outside her door
says , " take what you can from your dreams
make them as real as anything
it'd take the work out of the courage "
but she says , " please
there's a crazy man that's creeping outside my door
i live on the corner of grey street
and the end of the world "
there's an emptiness inside her
and she'd do anything to fill it in
and though it's red blood bleeding from her now
it's more like cold blue ice in her heart
she feels like kicking out all the windows
and setting fire to this life
she could change everything about her
using colors bold and bright
but all the colors mix together - to grey
and it breaks her heart
it breaks her heart
to grey
