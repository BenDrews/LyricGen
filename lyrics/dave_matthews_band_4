come out come out
no use in hiding
come now come now
can you not see ?
there's no place here
what were you expecting
not room for both
just room for me
so you will lay your arms down
yes i will call this home
away away
you have been banished
your land is gone
and given me
and here i will spread my wings
yes i will call this home
what's this you say ?
you feel a right to remain ?
then stay and i will bury you
what's that you say
your father's spirit still lives in this place
i will silence you
here's the hitch
your horse is leaving
don't miss your boat
it's leaving now
and as you go i will spread my wings
yes i will call this home
i have no time to justify to you
fool , you're blind , move aside for me
all i can say to you my new neighbor
is you must move on or i will bury you
now as i rest my feet by this fire
those hands once warmed here
i have retired them
i can breathe my own air
i can sleep more soundly
upon these poor souls
i'll build heaven and call it home
cause you're all dead now
i live with my justice
i live with my greedy need
i live with no mercy
i live with my frenzied feeding
i live with my hatred
i live with my jealousy
i live with the notion
that i don't need anyone but me
don't drink the water
don't drink the water
there's blood in the water
don't drink the water
