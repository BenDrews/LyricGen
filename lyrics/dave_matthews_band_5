say , my love , i came to you with best intention
you laid down to give to me just what i'm seeking
say love , you drive me to distraction
oh my love do you believe that we might last
a thousand years , or more if not for this
our flesh and blood , it ties you and me right up
tie me down , ah well
celebrate we will
because life is short but sweet for certain
( hey )
we're climbing two by two
to be sure these days continue
things we cannot change
( change )
( why would i want to change it )
( change )
hey , my love , you came to me like
wine comes to this mouth
grown tired of water all the time
you quench my heart and , oh , you
quench my mind
celebrate we will
because life is short but sweet for certain
( hey )
we're climbing two by two
to be sure these days continue
things we can
celebrate , oh , you and me girl
climb onto my
( climb onto my )
two , to be sure
these days continue
things we cannot change
change
change
oh , my love i came to you
with best intention
you laid down to give to me
just what i'm seeking
say love , watch me celebrate together
celebrate we will
cause life is short
but sweet for certain
we're climbing two by two
to be sure these days continue
things we cannot change
( celebrate together )
oh ho
( climbing two by two )
( climbing two by two )
( celebrate these days come two )
things we cannot change
( woman i took it all )
