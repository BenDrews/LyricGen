you cannot quit me so quickly
there's no hope in you , for me
no corner you could squeeze me ?
but i got all the time for you , love
the space between
the tears we cry
is the laughter - keeps us coming back for more
the space between
the wicked lies we tell
in hope to keep safe from the pain
but will i hold you again ?
these fickle , fuddled words confuse me
like 'will it rain today ? '
waste the hours with talking , talking
these twisted games we're playing
we're strange allies
with warring hearts
what a wild - eyed beast you be
the space between
the wicked lies we tell
in hope to keep safe from the pain
will i hold you again ?
will i hold...
look at us spinning out in
the madness of a roller coaster
you know you went off like
a devil in a church
in the middle of a crowded room
all we can do , my love
is hope we don't take this ship down
the space between
where you smile and hide
is where you'll find me if i get to go
the space between
the bullets in our firefight
is where i'll be hiding , waiting for you
the rain that falls
splashed in your heart
ran like sadness down the window into your room
the space between
our wicked lies
is where we hope to keep safe from pain
take my hand
cause we're walking out of here
oh , right out of here
is all we need dear
the space between
what's wrong and right
is where you'll find me hiding , waiting for you
the space between
your heart and mind
is a space we'll fill with time
the space between
the tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
the space between
our wicked lies where we hope to keep safe from pain
the space between
the space between
