wanna pack your bags , something small
take what you need and we'll disappear
without a trace , we'll be gone , gone
the moon and the stars will follow the car
and then , when we get out to the ocean
we're gonna take a boat to the end of the world
all the way to the end of the world
oh , and when the kids are old enough
we're gonna teach them to fly
you and me together
we could do anything , baby
you and me together , yes , yes
you and me together
we can do anything , baby
you and me together , yes , yes
you and i , we're not tied to the ground
not falling , but rising , like rolling around
eyes closed above the rooftops
eyes closed , we're gonna spin through the stars
our arms wide as the sky
we gonna ride the blue all the way to the end of the world
to the end of the world
oh , and when the kids are old enough
we're gonna teach them to fly
you and me together
we could do anything , baby
you and me together , yes , yes
you and me together
we could do anything , baby
you and me together , yes , yes
we can always look back at what we did
always the memory of you and me , baby
but right now it's you and me forever , girl
and you know we could do better than anything that we did
you know that you and me , we could do anything
you and me together
we could do anything , baby
you and me together , yeah , yeah
two of us together
we could do anything , baby
you and me together , yeah , yeah
two of us together
yeah , yeah
two of us together
we could do anything , baby
something small
until we reach the end of the world
