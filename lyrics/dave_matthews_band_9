mess your mama bed for a little more magic
make you want to run around naked
cause you know it look good on you

seen you there behind the miller's shed
your dirty little boy , you giving him head

that the joy is steeped with sin
all he want to do is go down on you
and all he want to do is go down on you
all he want to do is go down on you
but the joy is steeped with sin
it soars inside my soul because of you
all that innocence that you inspire
you know you are as heaven intended you
open up that lovely flower

all that we need to make love happen
love inside your head

it soars inside my soul because of you
all that innocence that you inspire
