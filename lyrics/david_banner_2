i got a 9 millimeter
ready to go off any minute so you feel it
because of the law , i had to conceal it
if you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it
tool on deck , why would i lie ?
nigga , you a pussy , hope you got nine lives
i can hit a nigga with the 9 nine times
country - ass boy , country like leann rimes
mississippi d - banner and lil weezyana
everybody got tools , so you will need a hammer
i'm a pill - poppin' animal , syrup - sippin' nigga
i'm so high you couldn't reach me with a fuckin' antenna
you fuckin' with this man , you can be this man's dinner
the 9 give me brains , but the ak add liver
the rapper is insane , flowin' like a mad river
make yo' ass quiver like you naked at winter
hollygrove honcho , hard time giver
i'm a shark in the water , you just long john silver
i got a girl , you wanna meet her ?
her name is 9 millimeter
i got a 9 millimeter
ready to go off any minute so you feel it
because of the law , i had to conceal it
if you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it
if i got nine slugs , nine bullets gon' fly
if i got a red beam , nine people gon' die
nine mamas gon' cry , nine spirits in the sky
nine preachers preachin' nine sermons , tellin' nine lies
'cause each and every one of y'all nine niggas wasn't shit
i would've rather kept the nine ruger's in the ruger clip
the index finger slipped , the nine let nine spit
i lick 'em all like eighteen tits on nine chicks
i'm a suicide risk , nine slits on each wrist
if i die nine times the next go - around's a bitch
and if i come back i'll throw 99 shows
and shove nine inches of dick in 99 hoes
i got a 9 millimeter
ready to go off any minute so you feel it
because of the law , i had to conceal it
if you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it
i'm a west coast original , black john wayne
nigga , where we from we like to pop that thang
you better stop that , mang
fat mouth to dogg and i'ma pop - pop - bang
pigs wanna bust me , hoes wanna suck me
niggas wanna touch me , none of that , trust me
i'm too slick , too sly , never snitch , i let it ride
i set aside all my feelings when i'm killin' like a villain
move quick like a cheetah , i'm a killa , i ain't here to lock up
i flash the heater , then lock yo' whole block up
dip - dop - deeter banner , turn the beat up !
illa - fo - reala my nilla dilla never caught
you niggas always actin' hard
i keep a 9 millimeter in my waist and got two more in the car
yeah , you're all about to get it
so quit it , tryin' to conceal it
you'll fuck around and make me reveal it , so killas kill it
i got a 9 millimeter
ready to go off any minute so you feel it
because of the law , i had to conceal it
if you fuck around you gon' make me reveal it
