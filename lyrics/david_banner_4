screens fallin' from the sky , syrup fallin' in my cup

got diamonds in my mouth , got some gucci on my seat
got g's on my ass , bitch it's cold when i speak
got a freak on my arm , got a charm around my neck

let them bougie boys ride maybach
i'm in the candy laid back like i slang crack
my money stacked to the ceilin'
gettin' in my chevy's like climbin' up a buildin' , them 28's on deck
37 on my wrist , a hundred five on my neck
this rap money's okay but you should see these movie checks
and this cartoon cash , the ss so sweet
my bentley's hatin' on that ass , my old school's gettin' pissed
she opened up her arm but then she slit both wrists
there go the suicide do's , wood on the dash
ferris wheels on the toes and got duals on the ass
and some chrome on the nose , the white boys go , " sweet "
but black folks go , " oh , " i got a 'llac full of ammo
i'm brick with the nine throwin' bombs out the lambo'
the butterflies goin' up
i got chad in my heart and dj screw in my cup
