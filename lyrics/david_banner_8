cadillac's on 22s
pimp my voice and mack these beats
pray to the to the lord for these mississippi streets
cadillac's on 22s
i ain't did nothing in my life but stayed true
pimp my voice and mack these beats
pray to the lord for these mississippi streets
god i know that we pimp , god i know that we wrong
god i know i should talk about more in all my songs
i know these kids are listening , i know i'm here for a mission
but it's so hard to get em when 22 " rims are glistening
i know these walls are talking , lord i want to do right
i tried to fight but these demons they come to me at night
like my momma , my daddy , my girl and all my boys
i lost michelle but i guess i still got dwayne and roy
my cousin sweets , mama lena and jason
lord i'm praying for swac , my heart is steady pacing
keep him off them drugs , far away from thugs
he's still my hero but just a shell , man of what he was
yeah smoke and get a buzz , but god i hear you calling
and shit wrong with balling , but my soul is just steady falling
in to sex and the debt , into an earthly jail
god i'm stacking my mail but will i end up in hell
lord they hung andre jones
lord they hung raynard johnson
lord i want to fight back but i'm just so sick of bouncing
lord i'm sick of jumping , lord please just tell me something
my folks still dumping my music bumping but i feel nothing
my heart is steady pumping , my heart is steady breaking
sometimes i feel like i'm faking , man i'm so sick of taking
maybe hell ain't a place meant for us to burn
maybe earth is hell and just a place for us to learn
bout your love , your will and grace
sometimes i wish i wasn't born in the first place
maybe this first base , god knocked the ball up out the park
so we can come home this world right here feeling so dark
it's feeling so cold , lord i'm getting so old
i don't if i can take this world right here no more
22 inch rims on the 'lac
i guess that was your footprint in the sand carrying us on your back
