( verse 1 )
i just text you girl
can you text me back
he don't love you girl
but you love to fight
far from sober now
battle service poppin
you've been drowned in lies and its hard to hide
he telling you he gonna wife it
you no longer get excited
you got that booty and you need someone to bite it
i'll bite it
( refrain )
i'll be in your dm's
hoping you will see them
maybe we'll go out fool around 10 pm
we gone hit it off
i'ma get involved
your family will know that i belong
i like to beat em
hope in one day
i'll respect ya momma and ya daddy don't play
i'll make them proud
you never gone cry
call your other nigga and tell him go bye
( chorus )
does he really love you girl
or does really love to lie
and tell me how you living girl
or maybe you just love to live the lie
tell me do you love him girl
or maybe you just love to lie
tell me how you living girl
or maybe you just love to live the lie
( verse 2 )
i don't love the lie
i'm holding on as it is
and she don't know how to show
how to love no more
you had a lot of lovers and the all just let you go
( you know they did )
i know you won't admit
you need someone to send us on
( refrain )
i'll be in your dm's
hoping you will see them
maybe we'll go out fool around 10 pm
we gone hit it off
i'ma get involved
your family will know that i belong
i like to beat em
hope in one day
i'll respect ya momma and ya daddy don't play
i'll make them proud
you never gone cry
call your other nigga and tell him go bye
( chorus )
does he really love you girl
or does really love to lie
and tell me how you living girl
or maybe you just love to live the lie
tell me do you love him girl
or maybe you just love to lie
tell me how you living girl
or maybe you just love to live the lie
( verse 3 )
i'm on a mission my visions to make you proud of men
you never care how you treated long as you got a man
call me stupid i call you cute but you just shut a man
caught in your web like spider man
and your last dude i'm not a fan
kinda made mistakes i fell from breaks
but now i'm saving faces
cover my bases your amazing
maybe i can take us places
baby your heavens saint
your body is my residence
i'll call you michelle , call me mr. president ( dang )
and you'll no longer live the lie
and you'll no longer live the lie
you make my head spin around round
head spin around head spin around
you make my head spin around round
head spin around head spin around
( chorus )
does he really love you girl
or does really love to lie
and tell me how you living girl
or maybe you just love to live the lie
tell me do you love him girl
or maybe you just love to lie
tell me how you living girl
or maybe you just love to live the lie
