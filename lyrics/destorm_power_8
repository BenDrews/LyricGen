we all been there
that time when you feel invincible
can do anything , can go anywhere
then , in the heat of the moment
we sometimes make decisions without
thinking about the consequences
yo
yo , these drinks and these girls , and these girls and the party
fuck a convo , all you wanna see is sweaty bodies
one particular night you barely made it to the lobby
we got a problem houston she screaming " i love it , bobby "
you didn't get her name , you just know she's from spellman
shorty so bad , played the game without a helmet
take her back to your dorm , bragging to your boys
got the door half cracked so they can hear the noise
hidden camera in the corner for everybody to enjoy
on the shelf with the team spirit , really they just decoys
you invincible , ain't watching for your health
six weeks , now more notches on your belt
slow down , man , you seen the clinic twice
now you got this morning cough , going fast like minute rice
convincing yourself if you good from the neck up
you don't need a doctor , you don't need a check up
headaches they coming in the middle of the season
it's the summertime , why the hell are you sneezing ?
your nose it keeps running so copping some sneakers
call shorty from spellman , but she said that she is just fine
too embarrassed to hit the other girls up
but one of them fucked your whole world up
was it lisa or keisha , cause she was with dan
not knowing that he was with ethan and stan
sometimes i feel like i'm invincible
sometimes , sometimes i feel like i'm incredible
sometimes , when i don't use my head
when i don't use my mind
when i don't think it through
i guess i'm invincible
this is my confession
i never wanted to wrestle with depression
let it get inside my head until i'm left with excessive aggression
now give me a weapon , my self expression is threatening
i'm excessively protective cause my head is getting messed with
and i'll accept this as a lesson
never question the direction i'm headed
i guess i'm destined to be a freshman amongst veterans
jane , stop this crazy thing ; george jetson
i couldn't sleep , so i kept thinking
i couldn't face reality , so i kept drinking
the more i kept drinking , the more i kept smoking
choking on the moments , my soul was totally broken
it's so confusing and so consuming
my life was out of order like a tarantino movie
so i looked at my reflection in the mirror and i said
" man , fuck my life - i wish i was dead "
sometimes i feel like i'm invincible
sometimes , sometimes i feel like i'm incredible
sometimes , when i don't use my head
when i don't use my mind
when i don't think it through
i guess i'm invincible
sometimes you gotta fall like rome then rebuild it
if there's ever snakes in the grass i'll reveal them
all you ever need is somebody on your team
that can make you realize there ain't nothing wrong with dreaming
fell so hard that they told you you were nothing
planned your return , but they thought that you were bluffing
stepped your game up , you done came up
now it burns their tongue every time they bring your name up
i'm back from the dead , i'm freddy and jason
i'm the architect , i hold the key to the matrix
and i hit these cats with a wiffle bat
they so fickle that they go and ask
for a change in my music and get a nickle back
i won't die a statistic
i'm living at xavier's school for the gifted
but i'm back , they said i'd never win this
not only am i back , bitch , i'm back with a vengeance
sometimes i feel like i'm invincible
sometimes , sometimes i feel like i'm incredible
sometimes , when i don't use my head
when i don't use my mind
when i don't think it through
i guess i'm invincible
