don't you think that we were beautiful ?
don't you think that i'm your friend ?
i'll be the first one to tell you a lie
wait until i know who you are
waiting for a shot in the dark
nothing that you're used to , to
once i told you about my other friends

wait until i know who you are
waiting for a shot in the dark
nothing that you're used to , to
wait until i know who you are
waiting for a shot in the dark
nothing that you're used to , to
