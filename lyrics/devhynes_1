it’s everything that you seem to ignore
the classroom that you treated as a bore
the alcohol you drank but never bought
the dress you stole and were never caught
the bed you wake up in that’s not your own
the makeup you applied two days ago
the night you lost your phone on the way home
the taxi ride where you decided your end goal
oooohh
and still i try to lure you into my own hurricane
it’s like you spot me trying from a thousand miles away
i look down on you so deep down i know that we’re the same
it’s stupid thinking that you would want to come play my game
tell me what’s wrong
