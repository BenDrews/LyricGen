calling out to you
to try and move on
and if something changes
then let me know
i'm getting my mind made up so bad
it's just like nothing else matters
i can't get a hold of you
i can't get a grip
i need a nailprimp
i can't help it
it's in your mind
and who knows if that's the thing that's right
all you know is what you think is inside
you just might lose your mind
better just forget it
tell me if it's alright
can i get out my way for a minute ?
i know we've both been through
heartbreak after heartbreak , an earthquake , yeah
tell me if it's okay
i think you landed on your two feet
made it through
feeling so shut down
had enough now
do whatever you're meant to do
this can't go on and on this way
can't find the words to say
if it's all okay
it's never wrong to move along
but if you hit the road , then hit me up !
so let me know , and i'll look you up
we could hit a lick , catch a grip
take a day trip for a nailprimp
say 'sayonara'
say 'geronimo'
take the leap , and just let go
feel the breeze when you feel the flow
goin' 'head , leave if you got to go , 'cause
people get stressed out
then people get left out
even when they step out
that might just be for the best now
miss me with all the bullshit
histrionics , cool it
no exegesis exists without
someone you can just be cool with
but it's cool and that's for sure
i can lose my mind
if you can promise you won't lose yours
it's in your mind
and who knows if that's the thing that's right
all you know is what you think inside
