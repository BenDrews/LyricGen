the rap merker's back
i'm killing ghosts and facing lame cats
i'll take your puppy dog and throw some jerky on the train tracks
think you're fly listen , i'll hawk a loogie at you hood spitters
remember your puppy ? i threw its body through a wood chipper
flow's mean and bitter , delivery smoother than the ups
i got the feds watching cuz i'm boxing up my new ex
put me on a pedestal i'm standing over top of gents
i'm feeling bad to butt - in but it's time to face the consequence
peace to ad , christ , the god's are looking down at me
notoriously nasty i'm hoping life is good after death
sticking my dick in your girl like i'm drilling for oil
i'm sorry man i'm meddling in your bushes , your plans will be foiled
see i'm the blue devil spitter and the game just committed to duke
if your too simple to get it , rap's going to shit
as soon as i spit i wreck tracks someone call the task force
that was just a test , dummy but you can't afford the crash course
lyrically you're
a biter like a teething baby
buy sunglasses , foam at the mouth , now i have rabies
fuck trees ! i hate oaks sign to interscope if i want it shady
i'm universal son , why'd you blew seamen like navy ?
i'm the fisherman ; i'm dropping my lines nonstop
i yell screw a hook while i shove my dick up your girl's tackle box
i have std's , but my worm's in your girl's snapper
after i finish , i nickname her mouth the crabs trapper
