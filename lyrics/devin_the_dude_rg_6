no more parties in la , or on rg
go crazy motherfucker
2017 , a new year to fuck everything up ! !
let's go
i may be the worst rapper on this website
but i can still kill you , resurrect you , and then send you back to death right ?
right now i feel lethal , like i just came out of bed - stuy
and you feeling like you could get more cause my meth's tight
no i'm not a drug dealer , or a rapper , i can't do shit
but even my mom will tell you i have a couple of screws loosened
i start bar fights , i hit car lights , with this armalite
start a riot , until we get our carter v
while i'm bumping out ice cube , and looking at nice boobs
this the new years , so i gotta bring out the lights too
if i don't directly diss you , then it'll go right through
one ear and out the other , just like what happens when i snipe you
i'm not as clever as all of your favorite rappers
but i'm not afraid to go right to your mom to go kidnap her
i wish my father would've got an apology from the condom factory
cause now i'm in a shithole , on the internet spitting out blasphemies
hiding behind computer screens , taking opportunities
to express and digest , i'm on pornhub looking at booty cheeks
depraved like i was when eight years old , waiting for the cops to serve us
you bastards get more pussy on accident then i will ever get on purpose
now i know about the economics but i ain’t never had heavy pockets
i stay connected to the circuit like i’m electronic
i get the paper , put the pen up on it , sometimes i get melancholic
when i’ve spent a tenner on a ten of chronic
i get up on it , commanding all the hegemonic masses
leave your city buried like atlantis
beseeched with the mic , i preach with importance
i’m the rebirth of hip hop unlike these abortions
take your precautions , i’ve an arsenal of weaponry
step to me , i’ll turn your fucking party to a cemetery
hardly in my pedigree , committing harder crimes
stranded , like i’ve been abandoned by father time
people tell me that it’s just a pipe dream , man
but flock to my music like i’m an ice cream man
it’s a nice dream and i’m ready to pursuit it
‘till i’m sponsored by nike , yo i’m finna just do it
i’m finna come through it and you know you can’t doubt the fact
a new king is in the building , are you down with that ?
ruling with an iron fist , welcome into my abyss
cast adrift , now do you know where my crown is at ?
my short fuse is the muse that i use daily
to move through the blues , use and abuse in the booth crazy
rude boy polluting the mood with his droogs , maybe
but has anyone tried to refuse me the truth lately ?
no use tryna save me , it’s already a bottle job
came from rags to spit flames kinda like a molotov
so you can even follow god and other false idols
but that won’t protect you from the assault rifles
i’ve got my disciples , know who my friends be
i drop bombs and come up with a buzz like md
if you don’t know , i’m a wolf dressed in sheeps clothes
always hard hitting and spitting when the beat flows
fuck the money , on that bitch
i’m gon throw some soul
with orchestrated brain flow
it’s that old same show
can’t make the pain go
when you switch that lane tho
in and out without strife
it put’s that shit on hold
that’s why i walk the way of life
searching for another road
swerving to another mode
i never break the code
what i abstain is boasting
to maintain forward motion
talkin bout myself , it’s the health
of the mind , i strive to find , more of
don’t need wealth to show off
what you need is love
think that’s the desired
but i was wrong before
i look above and inside
to get it right for sure
from above i receive light
can’t demand anymore
but from inside i seek insight
into my own core
it’s not the books that you read
or the food that you eat
what it needs is time
to find enough sunshine
will be enough of course
it’s the only source
that’s strong enough to break the light drought
i talked about , and i’m out
will write something eventually
it’s the rebirth of slick without a children’s story
be on some black thought shit by the time i’m hitting forty
or go jay and drop two lines a year like he was still hustling
fuck the beat for each string , this is the art of seduction
and i ain’t never been to la but i’ll bet , you’ll see
when i do i’ll get shot four times in a black suv
like the seven forty five homicide in vegas , die a legend
come back a hologram , restart the verse and get my vengeance
call the presses
this nigga get bigger with every letter
so sick alphabet soup better than cheddar
been all gouda
puffing the buddha belly on telly
visions of spitting lines , picture pictures on getty
im the best already
got confetti by the pounds
give a fuck bout how it sounds
don't like it then try to best me
steel sharpening lead
don't let shrapnel to your head
last nigga who did it failed
so really who wan test me
senor escalante
schooling these niggas my way
giving niggas the deadline papers are due on friday
rose up in this garden
i’m tired of fucking sparring
line up all you garbage rappers
see what’s really gwanin
it don’t matter what your seed is i’m going undefeated
stack up all your achievements
still rookie of the season huh ? !
no more parties man
no more sunshine
no more la
no more fun time
it's back to delivering heart attacks
fresh steamed cardiac
we teaching you how to rap
might as well run it back
if you still trynna pass , nigga
scary
scary
no more parties in the private jets
my island of diamonds frighten the private chefs
the science of rhyming , designing the timing
now , silence , as we compiling all of the dying
start a combustion , make the infection expand
don't distract the destruction at the concession stand
by the end of our 4 years , all the elections banned
because they believe in false hope of an adolescent man
who let these fake niggas in the election booth ?
all of y'all need to come out to the confession booth
and once you tell the truth , to the electric chair
how you voting for a racist with dyslexic hair
but it don't matter cause canada , i'm protected there
choppers to donald trump , i might have some connections there
i take attendance to the amendments , you offending
i'm still ending all these pretending lieutenants
too intricate for you to be playing my syndicate
intricate , physical sickness of the magnificent
your rap bars are for amusement
i use it to clean up after my bowel movements
come to a conclusion that you losers can't be included
if your bars sub - par , sub zero on illusions
some of you niggas wack as fuck and i'm just an improvement
you giving up rhymes like you do with prostitution
it get cold like minnesota state
so when you come around the sorcerer , don't choke like golden state
in this environment surrounded by depression
sense of entitlement abandoned in your reflections
never satisfied , i pacify a pastor , he sacrificed
no more parties in the afterlife
fuck capital
fuck a tankie
just a wobbly
feeling shoddy
holdin' a shotty
for every nazi body
word to ali
we lost you
but not forgot -
- ten shinhan with the shits
richard spencer can eat a clip
may your white power neck
meet my working class fist
if you trynna diss me , i’ll take one clip for your entire clique
i’ll just take non - specific shots , when i feel like it
get your dick outta my biz , i don’t need y'all to criticize shit
i’m not far from being a doctor , so i know that i’m sick
and i ain’t got no time , cause i still have to write six
articles and an ebook , making sure they turn out quite lit
i love myself , i get a hard on , when i glance in the mirror
and i'mma put a ring on 2017 , cause i’m the man of the year
i’m into 16 lines white and mighty fine
hit me in the mind with a vision slightly blind
that’s a crystal ball for the doomsday party
the pistol’s small but appetite for shot’s hearty
i got intoxicated by the venom i spit
a serpent’s wit hated by men whom i rip
shit , this sounds like rigamortis
my home grounds the mic but grown to enormous
this the first verse to end all bitch
so it’s the great verse where then we spend full clips
verses be wars whats more that’s an adlib
the left of your chest could only feel a bad rib
oh well , its time to say goodbye to you criminals
i hope hell makes dying to be miserable
shit that was a trip i really let it rip
i’m 16 lines white and mighty fine your drug bitch
no more parties
theimk , don't count me out – cut the beat !
the illmindedkidd , drag your body in a ditch
went home to fuck your little bitch
i'm will , and she eva , she all on my hitch
more g than disney , i leave your body in a stitch
i wanna know where's lilo ?
probably doping out with jumba and pleak doing kilos
i can't play b - ball but the lines i drop is free throws
freestyle , i'm too wild , you're soft , you too mild
i laid this verse out , evenly tiled
you could never party like me , stay a child
17 years old , i'm not like joey , i don't care if i meet hova
i'll be on my drake shit till everything is over
i pull up to stop the party in a rover
control the song , like i cut the beat , i'm small as kendrick
but i spit big flows , like i got a good physique
i got it from here , thank you five - foot freak
i mean the one and only phife , and i partied too hard
and it's gonna cost me my only life , pursuing my happiness
i'm indicud , speeding bullet to heaven , need a better mix from steve and his sister devin
luckier than the number seven , bucking shots with smif - n - wessun
being thankful my party in life was a blessing
happy new years , and new tears , and new fears , i'll always keep it real , cause imk is the new deal
