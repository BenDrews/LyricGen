needs : rb , dt , wr , rg , lg
analysis : same with peyton manning , i don't list tom brady as a " franchise " player here due to his age. the same actually goes with darrelle revis at cornerback ( age 29 ) . otherwise , rob gronkowski is truly an elite weapon and has a case for best overall player in the league at this point , assuming he's healthy. nate solder has also proven that he's an athletic , franchise tackle for tom brady or whoever ends up at qb in a handful of years. they could use some skill players , though. running back is a mess , and what do you do once brady leaves and you see how bad some of these guys really are ? interior line also isn't in the most formidable shape at this point. defensively , they're pretty good for now and the future. with chandler jones leading the charge , along with veteran rob ninkovich , along with front four and the likes of jamie collins , dont'a hightower , and jerod mayo in the middle three. the secondary is young and up - and - coming , but it's led by savvy , soon - to - be - considered veteran devin mccourty at fs. the big thing with new england , similar to denver , is what happens once tom brady hangs it up , because my gut also tells me that once he's done , so is belichick.
