bet you think i'm sitting at home , naw
bet you think that i'm all alone , naw
i bet you think i'm missing you and wishing you would call my phone
hell naw
i went wheels up on a runway
and that ticket was a one - way
i'm somewhere on a beach
sipping something strong
got a new girl , she got it going on
we drink all day , and party all night
i'm way too gone to have you on my mind
she got a body , and she's naughty
and she got me like you ain't never got me
i'm getting sun , getting some , and i ain't slept in a week
yeah , i'm somewhere on a beach
heard you called my boys
heard you called my folks
they said you drove by my house real slow
you can check any spot , roll down every road
but girl , i ain't even close
i'm somewhere on a beach
sipping something strong
got a new girl , she got it going on
we drink all day , and party all night
i'm way too gone to have you on my mind
she got a body , and she's naughty
and she got me like you ain't never got me
i'm getting sun , getting some , and i ain't slept in a week
yeah , i'm somewhere on a beach
i wish it could've worked out
but i'm gettin' over you now
on a beach towel
my shades on
my drink's up and the sun's out
i'm somewhere on a beach
i'm somewhere on a beach
sipping something strong
got a new girl , she got it going on
we drink all day , and party all night
i'm way too gone to have you on my mind
she got a body , and she's naughty
and she got me like you ain't never got me
i'm getting sun , getting some , and i ain't slept in a week
yeah , i'm somewhere on a beach
yeah , i'm somewhere on a beach
