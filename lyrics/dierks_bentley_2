she don't throw any t - shirt on and walk to a bar
she don't text her friends and say , " i gotta get laid tonight. "
she don't say , " it's okay , i never loved him anyway. "
she don't scroll through her phone just looking for a band - aid
it's different for girls when their hearts get broke
they can't tape it back together with a whiskey and coke
they don't take someone home and act like it's nothing
they can't just switch it off every time they feel something
a guy gets drunk with his friends and he might hook up
fast forward through the pain , pushing back when the tears come on
but it's different for girls
she don't sleep all day and leave the house a wreck
she don't have the luxury to let herself go
( she won't call just to curse
found a wall she can punch
when the going gets tough , yeah , the guys they can just act tough )

nobody said it was fair
when love disappears , they can't pretend it was never there
