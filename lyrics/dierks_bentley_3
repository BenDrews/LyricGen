don't worry about the damage done
just let those words roll off your tongue
even if you're lying
if you really don't mean it , i don't care
if you need a little buzz to get you there
then baby i'm buying
well couldn't you
say you do
say you might
for tonight
have a heart
bend the truth
even if you don't
couldn't you
mess me up
get in my head
steal my t - shirt
wreck my bed
all night long
like you used to
even if you don't
couldn't you
say you do ?
yeah baby , i'm begging you to lead me on
say it feels good to be back in my arms
and then don't call me
i don't mind a little smoke getting in my eyes
baby , take your hands , take your lies
and lay 'em on me
well couldn't you
say you do
say you might
for tonight
have a heart
bend the truth
even if you don't
couldn't you
mess me up
get in my head
steal my t - shirt
wreck my bed
all night long
like you used to
even if you don't
couldn't you
say you do ?
