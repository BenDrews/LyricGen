levi jacket broken in just right
i left it on the bleachers that friday night
felt so cool in the stone - washed fade
there's just some things that can't be replaced
that runaround freedom summer '89
spinnin' that bottle on a lot of first times
it was all summed up on a memorex mixtape
there's just some things that can't be replaced
woah , it don't matter how hard you try
woah , all the money in the world won't ever buy
what you miss , what you want back
it'd be nice , but life don't work like that
you can get damn close , but it won't ever be the same
there's just some things that can't be replaced
there's just some things that can't be replaced
cinnamon hair and a heart of gold
chevy cavalier on an old backroad
a booneâ€™s farm kiss that i still taste
there's just some things that can't be replaced
woah , no matter how hard you try
woah , all the money in the world won't ever buy
what you miss , what you want back
it'd be nice , but life don't work like that
you can get damn close , but it won't ever be the same
there's just some things that can't be replaced
there's just some things that can't be replaced
woah
for fifteen years right by my side
from a single man to three kids and a wife
friends come and go , but when it comes to jake
there's just some things that can't be replaced
woah , no matter how hard you try
woah , all the money in the world won't ever buy
what you miss , what you want back
it'd be nice , but life don't work like that
you can get damn close , but it won't ever be the same
there's just some things that can't be replaced
there's just some things that can't be replaced
woah ( woah )
