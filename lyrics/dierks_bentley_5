the phone lights up in the dark
asks where you are and i start driving
meet me for a drink
just an hour , maybe two , maybe three
baby i'm in
girl , you can't take your eyes off me
and that first kiss is sweet relief
ain't no one gotta know
just one more before you go
i don't wanna be a liar
i don't wanna be a fool
i don't wanna be a secret
but i will if you want me to
you can leave me in the dark
if that's all i get from you
he can be the sun
i'll be the moon
yeah , he can be the sun
i'll be the moon
the phone lights up in the dark
gotta go i know but it still ain't easy
tomorrow you'll be waking up beside him
tell him that you love him
but you still see me
in my mind when i'm looking at him
and in my eyes
it's the obvious elephant in the room
he can't see it , but girl you do
i don't wanna be a liar
i don't wanna be a fool
i don't wanna be a secret
but i will if you want me to
you can leave me in the dark
if that's all i get from you
he can be the sun
i'll be the moon
yeah , he can be the sun
i'll be the moon
the phone lights up in the dark
yes it's my turn , and i start driving
i don't wanna be a liar
i don't wanna be a fool
i don't wanna be a secret
but this is something i can't lose
you can leave me in the dark
if that's all i get from you
he can be the sun
i'll be the moon
he can be the sun
i'll be the moon
phone lights up in the dark
