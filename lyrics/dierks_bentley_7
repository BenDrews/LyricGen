you can't make a wish , on a star , when they're all burnt out
you can't find that hope , swallowed up , in the deepest dark
the light at the end of the tunnel's a train
you're tied to the tracks with the heaviest chains
let's chase away , the storms and the rain
and the days of dark ( oh - oh - ohh )
your hand in mine , there's no better time
or a place to start ( oh - oh - ohh )
let's raise a glass , to the pain of the past
and never look back on these broken hearts
bright red horizon , the sun started shining
so open your eyes , and let's say goodbye
to the days of dark ! ( oh - oh - ohh , oh - ohhh )
it's good to feel you kiss , a smile , back on my face
it's good to feel that rush , of blood , back in my veins
let's dance through the fire , break out of this cage
let's turn off the music , and let's turn the page
let's chase away , the storms and the rain
and the days of dark ( oh - oh - ohh )
your hand in mine , there's no better time
or a place to start ( oh - oh - ohh )
let's raise a glass , to the pain of the past
and never look back on these broken hearts
bright red horizon , the sun started shining
so open your eyes , and let's say goodbye
to the days of dark ! ( oh - oh - ohh , oh - ohhh )
still in the weeds , not out of the woods
but something in my heart
tells me that this is the start
of something good ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4... )
let's chase away , the storms and the rain
and the days of dark ( oh - oh - ohh )
your hand in mine , there's no better time
or a place to start ( oh - oh - ohh )
let's raise a glass , to the pain of the past
and never look back on these broken hearts
bright red horizon , the sun started shining
so open your eyes , and let's say goodbye
to the days of dark ! ( oh - oh - ohh , oh - ohhh )
the days of dark ! ( oh - oh - ohh , oh - ohhh )
hey !
