woke up this mornin' with my cellphone ringin'
she said , " i know that when you called me , you were drinking
but i loved every single word you left on my phone
and i know you're hung - over but i'm comin' on over "
did i say we'd go shoppin' , that i'd louis vuitton her
that i'd rodeo drive her , slide a tiffany diamond on her
what the hell did i say
when i called last night
drippin' words of whiskey honey
in that message that she liked
what the hell did i say
gotta dial it up again
un - blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
what the hell did i , hell did i , hell did i say
what the hell did i , hell did i , hell did i say
last thing i remember , i was thinking i'd call her up and
put her on speaker while the whole bar sang free bird
had that phone in my hand when i ran into trouble
my friend comin' over with a couple of doubles
what the hell did i say
when i called last night
drippin' words of whiskey honey
in that message that she liked
what the hell did i say
gotta dial it up again
un - blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
what the hell did i , hell did i , hell did i say
what the hell did i , hell did i , hell did i say
did i say we'd go shoppin' , that i'd louis vuitton her
that i'd rodeo drive her , slide a tiffany diamond on her ?
did i tell her she could move in and we'd fly out to vegas
champagne all the way and we'd get married by elvis
what the hell did i say
when i called last night
drippin' words of whiskey honey
in that message that she liked
what the hell did i say
gotta dial it up again
un - blackout those lines that fell out drunk at 3 am
what the hell did i , hell did i , hell did i say
what the hell did i , hell did i , hell did i say
what the hell did i say ?
what the hell did i say ?
