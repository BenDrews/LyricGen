i just wanna hear your voice
cut through the line like a heart - shaped knife
cut me down baby , one more time
good or bad baby
yes , no , maybe
it's driving me crazy
won't you pick up the phone ?
i can pick up some wine
i can pick you up in my pickup truck
and we can pick up right where we left off
ain't that what we both want ?
pick up the pieces girl
it ain't that broke
pick up the past and just let it go
put down that over me - never wanna see me again - goodbye kinda stuff and pick up
you're putting me through hell one ring voicemail
