shots ringing out , i'm soaking
eardrums shaking , years start weighin' me down
crawling out from a spiral down
fixing now to mix the white and brown
passing out , running in place
you're the sun and i'm your cloud
burning down , running in place
got so high i finally felt like myself
shots wringing out , i'm soaking
eardrums shaking , years start weighing me down
buried deep in a heroine sleep
floating deeper underground
passing out , running in place
you're the sun and i was your cloud
burning out , running in place
got so high i finally felt like myself
would you give your 81st year
for a glimpse of heaven , now and here ?
would you give your 60th year
for a glimpse of heaven , now and here ?
would you give your 45th year
for a glimpse of heaven , now and here ?
would you give your 34th year
for a glimpse of heaven , now and here ?
