i saw you with a very loose grip on your tight ship
and i left you with a very big mess then i watched it progress
took a little time for your trip but i saw you starting to slip
and you always kept your eyes on any little hiding spot that you had forgot
and i saw you after a decent spell in a private hell
and i told you , " i hope i live a thousand lives , hope i live them well "
fought my mind to keep my life , but my body’s putting up a tougher fight
yeah if it feels wrong , you can go on along
but once it feels right then you just lost the fight
i saw you with a very loose grip on your tight ship
and i lost you when you said one hit couldn’t hurt a bit
took a little time for your trip but i saw you starting to slip
cause you always kept your eyes on any little hiding spot that you had forgot
i can’t shake the terror of my life fleeting , minute by minute
even when i can’t imagine another day waking up in it
fought my mind to keep my life , but my body’s putting up a tougher fight
yeah if it feels wrong , you can go on along
but once it feels right then you just lost the fight
