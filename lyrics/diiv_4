how could i describe
this fading dream ?
you turned and looked a way
it goes around getting louder now
believe it
freezes love that way
name the song and i’ll
just scream it
there’s a
dead moon in my head
it claws the ground both lost and found
and fleeting
to crash into again
——
how could i describe
a long lost dream ?
you turned and looked a way
i’ve lived ten lives and had ten loves
to remind me
what i’ve been guilty of
say the song and i’ll
just scream
it there’s a
fucked moon in my head
it claws the ground both lost and found
and fleeing
from the healthy moon
