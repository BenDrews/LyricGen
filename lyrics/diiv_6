you ain't the first to realize
you ain't the first to look in my eyes
over my head and positive
i have a gift that i’ll never give
you ain't the first
you ain't the first
last time i walked down this street
i walked down this street
i wanted to die
die
now i’m fighting
i feel like i’m fighting
i feel like i’m
fighting for my life
life
