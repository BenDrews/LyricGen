thereâ€™s a crack
reflective grass
stone face
mute glance
high black
in the back of
a normal joke
easier to choke
smile glue
bad stick/bad fit
with you
a blanket curse
a made up bed that waits
in heaven
you have my face
my neck my waist
and a fucking saint
in a rocking chair
that stays in place
thief for a chance
kiss for a catch
blue flower
blue boredom !
did you know i colored in the clues
for you for you
they make a game
that spells your name
fresh fear at the centerfold
colored mess to backwards steps
always taste
like another face
always smell
like a kind of hell
waterproof person to be
to be
blood like soap
when water washes it thin
washes it away to stay
