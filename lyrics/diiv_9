the only way to be quiet is to be quick
a slow death rite like an innocent fight
left me choked and white in a patch of light
feeling like a wick wax drowned and bright
burned skin like a string black ashes slight
i know i gotta kick but i can’t get sick
i’ll hold you here tight , keep you overnight
and it gets too bright , and your body’s a brick
keep outta sight while my watch just ticks
i’m trying to keep quiet but i can’t move quick
drowning in air , light , floating up in flight
then it gets too bright , and your body’s a brick
you fall
i forced myself to be quiet just to be quick
lead a slow death rite like an innocent fight
left me choked and white in a patch of light
feeling like a wick wax drowned and bright
burned skin like a string black ashes slight
i know i gotta kick but i can’t get sick
i’ll hold you here tight , keep you overnight
and it gets too bright , and your body’s a brick
but now i’m fucked to die in a world of shit
i’m trying to keep quiet but i can’t move quick
wings matted with death spilled oil slick
then it gets too bright , and your body’s a brick
and you fall
