can you see it ?
the worst is over
the monsters in my head are scared of love
fallen people listen up !
it's never too late to change our luck
so , don't let them steal your light
e eh eh eh
don't let them break your stride ( e eh eh eh )
there is light on the other side
and you'll see all the raindrops falling behind
it's a revolution
make it out tonight
it's a revolution
it's a revolution
it's a reva , rev
( oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh )
it's a reva , rev
( oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh )
it's a reva , rev
( oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh )
