put it on ice bitch , dr. pepper
feeling so clean , it don't get no fresher
chillin' in the freezer when i'm under pressure
i put it on ice bitch , dr. pepper
dr. pepper , dr. pepper
dr. pepper , dr. pepper
dr. pepper , dr. pepper
chilling in the freezer when i'm under pressure
i put it on ice bitch , dr. pepper
can't handle this volume
can't handle this
can't handle this song
but you going bounce to this shit
bounce to this shit
bounce to this shit
put your this face on , lemme see you bounce to this shit
phone calling i'm pressing red
only red cup that's in my hand
i ain't got the time , so why you asking
i got a flight to catch , i'm always traveling
they packing
put it on ice bitch , dr. pepper
feeling so clean , it don't get no fresher
chillin' in the freezer when i'm under pressure
i put it on ice bitch , dr. pepper
dr. pepper , dr. pepper
dr. pepper , dr. pepper
dr. pepper , dr. pepper
drivin' backwards through rome in a range rover
you skatin' on thin ice , anna kournikova
rap game tony danza with the hot handles
no tint on the glasses , colonel sanders
i can las vegas valet at the wynn
the burly boys in the candy blueberry benz
i done rock more ice than michelle kwan
aw shit , look who it is , the white barry bonds
a heavyweight , you a featherweight
i can meditate , make my trunk levitate
i used to go campin' in that emerald flannel
ghost stories o'er versace candles
riff !
put it on ice bitch , dr. pepper
feeling so clean , it don't get no fresher
chillin' in the freezer when i'm under pressure
i put it on ice bitch , dr. pepper
dr. pepper , dr. pepper
dr. pepper , dr. pepper
dr. pepper , dr. pepper
put it on ice like the musicals
shootin' for the top no call of duty though
doctor weather sippin' , sippin' on her like a dr. pepper
i ain't thinkin' with my pecker
but when i am in advantage she know 'mac a spender
so outlandish when they catching candies
women gettin' friendly treasure landin' pimpin'
and the windows tinted and this shit is bangin'
leave this bitch there , goddamn
chick with me and she far from dizzy
but she kinda dizzy from these round trips
and she talkin' money you don't hear a quip
every last nigga
makin' anthems with my lady
going on tangents , making papers
haters that play it just bring green
two million and a half , charlie sheen
wrist glisten and the neck glean
so supreme like sean stussy
grip the pistol , it's easy choosing
so in any battle , ain't no better than losing
dr. pepper , dr. pepper
dr. pepper , dr. pepper
dr. pepper , dr. pepper
chillin' in the freezer when i'm under pressure
i put it on ice bitch , dr. pepper
