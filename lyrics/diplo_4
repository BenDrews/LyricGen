i stood alone watching the wall , in the zone , hand on my handles
listening to gangsta music
i stood at home hand on a chrome , with a zone , flippin' the channels
watching how the gangstas do it
i stood alone , getting dome , from a thick chick in sandals
watching shaft , clocking math
now i see death around the corner

i stood alone watching the wall , in the zone , hand on my handles
listening to gangsta music
i stood at home hand on a chrome , with a zone , flippin' the channels
watching how the gangstas do it
i stood alone , getting dome , from a thick chick in sandals
watching shaft , clocking math
i'm on the westside of chicago , lookin' for a bust - down
to make me put my two arms up , touchdown !
