you love how you push me to the point of crazy
and i love when you're on your knees and begging for me
you got me good with all these mind games
there you go , you got my heart again
say my name , i wanna hear you call
hold me close , i wanna feel your heart
i'm in a cold sweat and i want you bad
now you got me all in my head , like damn
i'ma show you how , show you how , show you how
to love again
i'ma show you how , show you how , show you how
to love again
i'ma show you how , show you how , show you how
to love again
i'ma show you how , show you how , show you how
to love again
say my name , i wanna hear you call
hold me close , i wanna feel your heart
i'm in a cold sweat and i want you bad
now you got me all in my head , like damn
i'ma show you how , show you how , show you how
to love again
i'ma show you how , show you how , show you how
to love again
i'ma show you how , show you how , show you how
to love again
i'ma show you how , show you how , show you how
