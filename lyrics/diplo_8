i've got all this love , waiting just for you
i just gotta know that your love is true
can't keep running boy in and out my life
wanna be your girl , not cause the mood is right
if i let you go inside , tomorrow will you hide
will you be there for me , when i need someone to hold
baby don't misunderstand , i do want you for my man
i just need a little time , before i invest my love
don't walk away , boy
( mmm , don't walk away )
my love won't hurt you
( no - no )
don't walk away , boy
( don't walk away )
i'll be right there for you
don't walk away
don't walk away , boy
( mmm , don't walk away )
my love won't hurt you
( no - no )
don't walk away , boy
don't walk away
i'll be right there for you
i'll be right there for you
don't walk away , boy
my love won't hurt you
( no - no )
don't walk away , boy
( don't walk away )
i'll be right there for you
( don't walk away )
don't walk away , boy
