it's not right , but it's now or never
and if i wait could i ever forgive myself ?
on a night when the moon glows yellow in the riptide
with the light from the tvs buzzing in the house
cause i'm gonna cut it where i can
and then i'm gonna duck out behind them
if i ever had a chance it's now then
but i never had the feeling i could offer that to you
to offer it to you would be cruel
when all i want to do is use , use you
he was a diplomat's son
it was '81
he was a diplomat's son
it was '81
dressed in white with my car keys hidden in the kitchen
i could sleep wherever i lay my head
and the sight of your two shoes sitting in the bathtub
let me know that i shouldn't give up just yet
cause i'm gonna take it from simon
and then i'm gonna duck out behind them
if i ever had a chance it's now , then
but i never had the feeling i could offer that to you
to offer it to you would be cruel
when all i want to do is use , use you
he was a diplomat's son
it was '81
he was a diplomat's son
it was '81
i know , you'll say
i'm not doing it right
but this is how i want it
i can't go back
to how i felt before
there's - -
that night i smoked a joint
with my best friend
we found ourselves in bed
when i woke up he was gone
he was a diplomat's son
it was '81
he was a diplomat's son
it was '81
looking out at the ice cold water all around me
i can't feel any traces of that other place
in the dark when the wind comes racing off the river
there's a car all black with diplomatic plates
