i always wondered what death would be like
especially when duke died and came back
and said he didn't see light
was that a glimpse into eternal sleep ? no afterlife ?
or promise of hell ? the mystery as dark as the night
all signs told me my days were numbered walking the earth
and i'd go out just as bloody as i did on my birth
my mother in pain she's still alive feeling the hurt
but my agony died with me when the weaponry burst
was it my destiny to lead a caravan in a hearse ?
i always thought i'd lead revolutionary victory first
but my enemy caught me slipping and dealt me the curse
now all my mind could think about is this verse
as i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
i can't sleep like i'm battling meth
the reaper creeps while i'm gasping for breath
i ask the lord to forgive me for debt
when death comes and my soul leaves my body to rest
no angels on my arrival and no light either
this might be the end of the road where life leaves you
atheist prophecy looking likely firm non - believers
faith is their robbery loot
religion cashing out on the dreamers
in the corner of this room i'm looking at my body
it's lifeless from a trife death with holes from a shotty
most of my limbs rotting , cold ? yeah probably
i'm tripping cause i'm in the middle of the spiritual
and physical parting
i wonder if this land of shadows is my purgatory
and wonder why if i was semi - righteous
did my end have murder for me
when i was young , man , i heard this story
if you don't reach your mission in life
you get a second chance for glory
is there revival for a common man ?
is that survival for the godly plan ?
the bible blueprints the last stand
god and devil armageddon - blast gangs
i reincarnate reborn with a gas mask
i don't think i'm alive i know i died
didn't survive the enemy gun fire
this ain't hell it's far from heaven
all i remember we was fighting
in the war of armageddon
now i'm stuck in a spiritual realm i don't think i'm going to
either heaven or hell i'm being sent back so we
can help and get it right this last time
we won't fail
as i walk through the valley of the shadow of death ( x2 )
