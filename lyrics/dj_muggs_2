yeah , yeah , yeah - one two , one two
aiyyo , wu - tang's invincible
but understand the principle
my man muggs , droppin phat tracks like drugs
breaker - breaker one two , breaker - breaker one two
you're breakin' up - peace
" we're at the crossroads , our immediate future
is the worst war man will ever know. "
via satellite from the wu - mansion
still branchin' off the tree that sparked any mc
and the fruit that fell far was the ripest
it was cypress , let the media hype this
promotion niggas snipe this
push it like tray bags of 72
kept niggas in suede rags
microphone psycho , who flips the mic so well
hell without bail , in jams packed like jail - cells
theres no escaping , once my blade starts scrapin'
niggas flakin' , wannabe mcs is shakin'
my sword indeed make more niggas bleed
so swift naked eye couldn't record the speed
i lost ya , wit that offer ; nigga that'll cost ya
feel the strings of torture
must've been the half - gal
that's the shit he drinkin' , that got him thinkin'
that he could trash the ship and get me sinkin'
i told him , " come back when you're sober "
drunk - ass punk , on the motherfuckin' hunt for red october
don't even catch me when i'm blunted
rhymes start runnin' like loops on a sp - 1200
instruments the terror on warship , its corporate
visual niggas paint portraits
yo , check the mic line for wire - taps
we're under attack , man your stations , take aim , proceed
fire back , all hands on deck : cadet , vets , insert cassettes
tracks snap heads like berets ; catch web - sites like internet
chief , i detected vehicles approaching from the east
pass the infrared binoculars , captain , so i can see
sound the alarm ; call for the suicidal - kamikaze ninjas with the bombs
flashes of neon , all we saw was flying arms
anytime i come by , alumni cut short their air supply
send 'em back like george mcfly
i , be holdin' this ; travel ground like a motorist
poisonous gas released from my track , its odorless and tasteless
like ghost is face - less
which allowed the god to break backs , and beat a hundred cases
mcs heads weave like trees , in a breeze to rhymes like these
underwater flow strike like torpedoes
you get plugged more than del rio ; played short like de vito
split the fuck up like mike - jack and tito
sword cuts sharper than concorde needles
call my second private , tell 'em write this important message to cypress
i heard yacub's assistant on the island was dr. titus
and they just released a new deadly virus
to infiltrate the western states
it's time to pump out more rap tapes
and use the wu - tang symbol to communicate
rza , over and out...
