composer ; dj premier
maestro ; sir nas
yeah
nas in the building
premier's in the building
yeah
this is how we redefine , the music
let's go
yeah , ya'll know i gets it on , sip on dom
clear the throat , wet the palate
compose a ballet , then expose a rare talent
the kick drum will have you numb , the snare's valid
that's how premier styles it
yeah ya'll know he gets it on , that's a given
every song i've written , make the sky clear blue
like the beginning scenes of the simpsons
dominions of the british empire
we'll listen to bach , with tea and biscuits
preem revisits , songs centuries old
hip - hop ; symphony's orchestras out cold with it
you know the flow's administered
by the deputy , rhyme prime - minister
sir nas , i'm certified
please be seated and your shirt and tie , dresses on
arrive early , when the curtains rise , bet it's on
a certain etiquette involved with this
unlike any other music genre is , bring the drama in
