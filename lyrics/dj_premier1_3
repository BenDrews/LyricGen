i pled my case with the gods , woman
just place your sweet shackles on my mind
i'm bound to an ocean of weightless love
no mercy , no pardon for stolen time , no
when the gavel hit the stand
i'm damned to loving you
two palm trees in the sand
i'm damned to loving you now
we set fire to these skies for our love
and i'd do it all again
i'm damned to lovin' you
( damn ! ) alright
( damn ! ) yeah woman
( damn ! ) lovin' you
( damn ! ) yeah , now
curse the stars now , there’s no escape
‘cause your walls are my favourite vice
two hearts committed to hopeless fate
i’d serve my life sentence a thousand times , woman
when the gavel hit the stand
i'm damned to loving you
two palm trees in the sand
i'm damned to loving you now
we set fire to these skies for our love
and i'd do it all again
i'm damned to lovin' you
( damn ! ) alright
( damn ! ) yeah woman
( damn ! ) lovin' you
( damn ! ) yeah , now
when the gavel hit the stand
i'm damned to loving you
two palm trees in the sand
i'm damned to loving you now
we set fire to these skies for our love
and i'd do it all again
i'm damned to lovin' you
it's like you've owned my love
and every life before
( every life baby )
and every life i've lived
( every time i )
you're all i'm searching for
( looking for you now )
it’s like you've owned my love
( looking for you baby )
in every life before
( longing for you darling )
in every life i've lived
( in every life now )
you're all i'm searching for
when the gavel hit the stand
i'm damned to loving you
two palm trees in the sand
i'm damned to loving you now
we set fire to these skies for our love
and i'd do it all again
i'm damned to lovin' you
just like it's always been
when the gavel hit the stand
i'm damned to loving you
i can't get away from it
two palm trees in the sand
i'm damn to loving you , now
we set fire to these skies for our love
and i'd do it all again
