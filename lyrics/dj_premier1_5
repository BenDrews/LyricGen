opportunity knocks , you better listen or you miss it
nah , but not me , see i was born to glisten , in
other words shine , since the day of my christening
and not just from the holy water dripping
off the dome like flows with jim prowes i’m spitting
and compare me to the legend from the home of the pistons
must’ve been your vision that was in on that decision
thank you , for real , but you gotta be kidding. , compare me to mr. mathers
see i know i showed talent and potential but so did hank gathers
rest in peace , meanwhile let’s increase
the love for the game invented in the streets
of the south south bronxcan't rep the boro
cause i am from the jerz and i’m definitely thorough
my confidence , makes it pretty hard to stay modest
truthfully seems i’m heating up the booth , preem be honest
alright alright alright alright , now let me calm down
maybe got ahead of myself but it’s gone now
back to earth
packing a mac in the verse
not in the back of the ac ,
but in the backpack with the jack flask
a pen and pad that’ll end your career
nickelus jav bringing lead to your ear
and not a .22 but two number twos
aimed at an mc wit an ego ready to bruise
whoever thought a bic and a pad that’s a quarter inch thick
could be deadly when mixed in a medley with nick
you better be sick if you readily spit
if you’re in pain take a lil’ wayne track six
i’m insane that’s it , came into the game that quick and the name’s javis
never forget it cause it will be repetted , oops i mean repeated
however never defeated
i gotta take a step back man i’m floating
in the studio wit preem , most cats don’t even know him
alright , enough brown nosing for the time being
i’m just appreciating what i’m seeing
this is crazy
i’m spitting from the same booth as b.i.g. , rakim , nas , and jay - z
thinking back to the times when my rhymes were basic
i coulda worn a “what would jay do” bracelet
never had the slightest thought of making it
and now i find myself in the presence of greatness
on the same mic where nas was like in the ny state of mind
so all you need is play and rewind
i’m standing in the same booth where the rapper with clout was unbelievable
and doubt was reasonable
i’m on the preem team for the long run , so when the song’s done
i am where i belong. one
