but the shit would never stick
i make one phone call and be out right quick
cause uncle dan had my back
and now niggas getting jealous cause they know i'm living fat

i'm sick and tired of these fake - ass niggas
saying that they're catching bodies when they never pulled a trigger

you wearing army suit , now you think you're hardcore
drinking on your 40's , smoking on your blunts
can't afford a chain so you wear gold fronts yeah

and you'd be getting it up the ass if you ever did a fucking bid
it's time to separate the real from the phony
