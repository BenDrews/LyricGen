it's my pleasure to bring to you somebody who's for the real people
" nyg "
remix
" it's most real in my everyday life " - infamous mobb 'we will survive'
" your days are numbered " - kool g rap
" stand tall , stick your chest out boy and be a man " - lord tariq & peter gunz ' marmalade'
" your days are numbered "
" never the less "
" it's most real in my everyday life "
same 59 - 50s on the same 3 - 60s
ain't shit changed , new team same game
back with another one , i said get used to us
thought it was a game
this time we got a crew with us
wipe my timb's on the welcome mat
kicked in the door like i knew i'd excel in rap
go head , nigga rock , this a warning shot
all that gonna stop when pro's & con's drop
" ya days are numbered " - kool g. rap
not me i'm fine
it's reference to y'all niggas
can't y'all see my grind ?
i'll put it all together , the way that i shine
with freddie foxx , lady of rage & royce 5'9 "
yo , pardon me
brother malcolm
i'm straight from the x
these niggas rappin' for the lames
y'all will rap for the rest
all i had to make was one phone call and i did it
yo preme , scratch the hook and trust we shit
rock on with your bad self
ha , boom shockalocka
yo , here comes the " chief rocka "
rage out the gate goin' straight for the knockout
you can't handle the lyrical damaga
i got porn star stamina
breathe easy you amateurs
i'm all action , no lights no cameras
no board , i'm been known to kill the bull like a matador
oye , ha
ukfe uye
you thinkin' i can't flow that ?
you can get the bozack
act like you know that
i'm one of the coldest
i'm smokin' like calvin broadus choking on green foliage
gotta , bone to pick with all those that hate
because i get bizzy like krayzie and layzie
you wish you could fade me
but my thugs stay n harmony
there's no harmin' me
i drops bombs with ease
with these nygz
makin' n.y. freeze
i'm still " unfuckwitable " , chick " you know my steez "
your days are numbered like the calendar
white potato on the derringer with duct tape to make a silencer
pretty much it's a wrap if i'm involved
clap with the revolver
strap , how i resolve
beef can be dissolved
quick as i evolve
lyrically , like a real mc is what i'm called
y'all niggas can't talk about guns to me
if you ain't never smelt saltpeter comin' from assault heaters
i know you're lookin' for your wikipedia
tryin' to figure out what the hell bump is feedin' ya
y'all see the duffel bag carryin' the muffled mac , magazine
filled with the hollow point al greene's
full of fire , i got verses for hire
they got nurses for hire
y'all all know that the style mean
i'll leave ya weezin' in the alley with a walkman on
playin' lil' weezy , tryin' to breathe easy
nick nine got the whole entire scene shook
heads bop , feds watch , cops , fiends look
i'm sittin' on throne lookin' like the king should
i let my records talk for me like a preme hook
i got the green foot
i kick money shit so much , it's funny shit
but creams how things look
bottom line , i'm a dollar sign
out of sight , out of mind
idolize , i'm already out of mine
signatures
dotted lines
zeros surrounded by my heroes
i'm livin' but honored by a mural
lock , load dispense
never at my expense
sawed offs frequent
y'all bought we spent
y'all recent , dog we vets
we wet niggas with the three tec
reflex , respect
a real nigga from the d
on a rise from them d's
on a ride with them gz
from ny
and that's why
