i saw you lookin' like a diamond in the rough
i told myself that one night ain't enough
then we started talkin , i mean stalkin'
lips are locking , remove your stockings
for me and you girl , one life ain't enough
but time , is our best friend
you blow my mind from the beginning to the end
our stars aligned , and now your future is mine
girl , your future is mine , girl your future is mine
when the sun comes up , our future's what i'm seeing
when sun goes down , that's when you start believing
that your only world it could be mine
all that i need is time
when the sun comes up , that's when i get the feeling
girl your future is mine
face it girls i've seen 2001
still wearing the same things from the 2001 !
but you seemed different , how you living
you'll handle the business , when i make you my mrs
i can't believe our story's just begun
cause time is our best friend
you blow my mind , from the beginning to the end
our stars aligned , and now your future is mine
girl , your future is mine , girl your future is mine
when the sun comes up , our future's what i'm seeing
when sun goes down , that's when you start believing
that your only world it could be mine
all that i need is time
when the sun comes up , that's when i get the feeling
girl , your future is mine
one night ain't enough
from crystal balls to disco balls and we go more
until we fall in love
one life ain't enough
so , just forget about the past
cause the future is where it's at
when the sun comes up , our future's what i'm seeing
when sun goes down , that's when you start believing
that your only world it could be mine
all that i need is time
when the sun comes up , that's when i get the feeling
girl , your future is mine
your future , your future
your future is mine
your future is mine
when the sun comes up
( girl , you'll be mine )
when sun goes down
( girl , you'll be mine )
when the sun comes up , our future's what i'm seeing
when sun goes down , that's when you start believing
that your only world it could be mine
all that i need is time
when the sun comes up , that's when i get the feeling
girl , your future is mine
