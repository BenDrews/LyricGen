you set me free every time your hands on me
i wanna be your way to shine
i can't deny the feeling that you're giving me
you lit the spark that set a fire
oh no , don't run away from your love
no , no , don't turn away from the heart of the groove
from the way that we move
kill the lights , we can't lose
kill the lights and look right at me
close your eyes , you can see me by the way that i feel
kill the lights and touch my body
close your eyes , you can see me by the way that i feel
come spin me around , let's get lost in the sound
close your eyes , you can see me by the way that i feel
touch my body , kill the lights tonight
let's live our life , tomorrow doesn't always come
don't try to hide , let's have some fun
you can't rely on anything or anyone
who fights the love you have inside
oh no , don't run away from your love
no , no , don't turn away from the heart of the groove
from the way that we move
kill the lights , we can't lose
kill the lights and look right at me
close your eyes , you can see me by the way that i feel
kill the lights and touch my body
close your eyes , you can see me by the way that i feel
come spin me around , let's get lost in the sound
close your eyes , you can see me by the way that i feel
touch my body , kill the lights tonight
kill the lights
kill the lights
close your eyes
close your eyes
kill the lights
kill the lights
close your eyes
close 'em , close 'em , close 'em
kill the lights and look right at me
close your eyes , you can see me by the way that i feel
kill the lights and touch my body
close your eyes , you can see me by the way that i feel
come spin me around , let's get lost in the sound
close your eyes , you can see me by the way that i feel
touch my body , kill the lights tonight
