star lit like a car sits in the dark when you have parked it like a nude stalker
catfish billy
i'm the king of the lowlifes

car crashed and then bar dashed in a hertz rental with a fat lip like burt reynolds moustache

bitch , better put your dukes up
i ain't got time for these vampires
throw 'em in the fire cause i am that true blood

so sick that i leave a tree standing up straight
leaned down like a weeping willow
deep in a pillow , dreaming , sleep walking
not one motherfucker in the game ready for the science

fat bitch in the front row
dry heave and coughing
get these hoes some h2o before i get fee'd for assaulting
blood i see it often
suds in the bottom of a jug

i could've got rich in a teeth auction
on stage like a priest talking

son of a bitch and the father of a church
similar to jesus when he found miss magdalene
mastermind
