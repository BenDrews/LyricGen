came so far , so far to go
money replace love , that’s cool
i can adapt
been a soldier from day 1 tho
tired of central bookin’
game made me an animal
tired of courtrooms
tired of phoney hugs and handshakes
i came up hard , still i rise
broken promises i couldn’t foresee
a rich crook from a poor thief
chow felipes from corn beef
a busy matrice and torn sheets
niggas don’t die , they take long sleeps
took wrong turns , ridin’ with the wrong peeps
tryna dodge potholes , had to take long leaps
slept on floors , now it’s floor seats
every month was a fucked up four weeks
i’m in the middle where peace and war meet
all i see is long coffins and more reefs ( ? )
wish i had less nightmares and more dreams
neva seen a clover with four leafs
a broken home is what police and the law leaves
but a nigga gotta eat , by all means
and his game ain’t nothin’ what it all seems
man , i remember when my truck got shot to fuck up
with me in it , and i’m still here to tell the story , nigga
i’m the last loyal nigga left
my co - defendant gave a statement to the state
i got the paperwork to prove it
i was facing a pbl : that’s punishable by life , nigga
i miss my nigga peanut , free gaino , rest in peace peasey
i’m on the way , tho , you livin’ yours , so why you wanna end mine ?
feds build a case just to bring down an empire
i’m prayin’ to a different god
i got different pro’lems , when i cry , it’s a different sob
i just wanna make it , freedom is a luxury and they just wanna take it
tryna find our way but we lost in hell
and we still sport a chain with the cross and nails
only way to stop me is to ak or glock me
couldn’t even do it when they locked me
i payed more dues than em , spoke more truth than em
sung more blues than em , when i write , i abuse the pen
between the lines in this paper , the proof is in
i refuse to be another name on the t - shirt
i refuse to bow down to a nigga that breathe the same air as me
i wadn’t cut like that , free my nigga loaf
free my nigga kano , rip all the fallen soldiers
peanut , venom , peesey , this yo boy gunplay
don loaf , the real livin’ legend signin’ out !
