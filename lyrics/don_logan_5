i got signed , ain’t shit change
i still sell crack , cocaine , loud and mid grade
niggas talking money , ain’t bank nothing yet
niggas talking bout killing , ain’t stank nothing yet
when a nigga slide whole hood said they heard i did it
threw the throwaways in the air like a shmurda fitted
nigga got them hundreds and they coming for your neck
bitch , i’m about a hundred , what the fuck is 50 cents ?
sold so much dope , man , i should've been the plug
down with s double m , man , i should've been a blood
rolling choppa in the club , but it should've been a slug
tried to be a rapper , but i should've been a thug
self made definition , razorblade on the dishes
hoes let me cut , razorblade on them bitches
gunplay , “mr. bible on the dash”
don logan , “mr. rifle in the stash”
i’m a real nigga , ain’t scared of the law
ain’t scared of y'all or what yall yelling out ya jaw
ak flip clip , that’s a mini draco
swinging that thing like jose canseco
