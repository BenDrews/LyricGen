chorus
wake up in the morning

man fuck them haters
that's why they hate ( x5 )

black magic chrome things
fresh spray im out of here
no miles new leather
stunting for my audience
putting on big time
but that ain't really shit tho
you can throw it in the club
but but that ain't really rich though
ain't that bout a bitch though
can't buy swag like this though
a white girl on white girl
thats what i call a disco
im all about that big dough

i gave that ho a double douse
she throwing back trying to get mo
quit asking who my jewler and
if i know slick rick the ruler

i knock it down
then keep that cadillac moving
