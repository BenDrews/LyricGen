no arm and hammer in my hannah montana
i got a clean thousand on the triple - beam bouncin'
it be jumpin' out the trap before the water out the faucet , work
broke before i bought it , like a rap before i wrote it
never loaded with no soda , your line gon' be round the corner
my digi gettin' busy , s550 to show
packs on packs on packs , fresh up out the ? ? ?
port authority i choke , already sold 'em i need mo'
papi straighten me and go , pick that up , adios
so you know , ain't no ? ? ? in here
all the way ? ? ? ? ? ? in here
try stick up the spot , sticks gon' ? ? ? you
stand behind my product , no pepsi in my bottle
i don't want it off top if it ain't off block
no arm and hammer in my hannah montana
no arm and hammer in my hannah montana
no arm and hammer in my hannah montana
straight bling bling , whippin' with an antenna
no arm and hammer in my hannah montana
no arm and hammer in my hannah montana
thousand grams of yayo , straight yayo , that mean i'm on

all black black down but my nine chrome

i just came to put in work and show you how to ruger jerk
i'm jupiter jack , welcome to my universe
i put bitches on the pole , 24 , gettin' dough

white jumpin' out the box of crayons all night

no arm and hammer in my hannah montana for life
