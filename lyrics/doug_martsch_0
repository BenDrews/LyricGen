your temper will change with the seasons
so sure of such stupid reasons
for your fall
i'll always be angry about it
i just won't always shout it
but you can trust
me again
me again
me again
me again
me again
there isn't a way of deciding
which half of life's less inviting
awake or a dream
cause both of them lead you to suffer
you wake from one into the other
twice a day
the sound of this song being shattered
when youve passed through it
it dosent matter
and you find out its
you again
you again
you again
you again
you again
is your heart too large for your sleeve ?
is your heart too large for your sleeve ?
