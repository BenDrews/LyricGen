( baby talking )
there's a color and a shape to the night
i'm not suprised you never wanted me to notice
when the darkness is covering and covering everything
i can feel it in my hands i try to hold it but it slips away
away
away
away
the empty desert bowl
and my belly's getting ______ down to the sand
and all thats left at dawn is ashes
no more blood or bones
and the green sun in my heart
although its always burning never keeps me warm
i'm always riding in its flames
flames
flames
flames
and if it isnt clear
then clear the way for something dear
and if you try
i'll try not to explain
open u p your window to the world
if you want the world to bring you happiness
and pain
pain
pain
pain
