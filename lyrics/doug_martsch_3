here the wayside meets the road
have to carry half the load
down the back roads with you go
all the letters that you wrote
now it's gone
how can you ever say why
now it's gone
how can you ever say why
i've been walking all night long
you've been sleeping prayers and songs
when you're wanted by the sun
you will get a kick from dawn
now you know
how can you ever say why
now you know
how can you ever say why
i'm alone now in your room
drawing plans for after noon
don't you want to go outside
take a walk or take a ride
now it's gone
how can you ever say why
now it's gone
how can you ever say why
now it's gone
how can you ever say why
now it's gone
how can you ever say why
leave your troubles , leave your fears
we'll get back to those next year
will you choose or change your mind
take a walk or take a ride
now i'm
happy you never say why
now i'm
happy you never say why
