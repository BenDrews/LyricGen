don't you get sick of it
stuck in the thick of it
making new friends you don't need
isn't it amazing how
everyone's crazy about
violence they can't conceive
well i hung around
like another pronoun
familiar but lacking a name
it was good enough for me
things never shared
things that don't mean much to me
things never shared
things that don't mean much to me
i'm on my gaurd
wait until you see
sometime , whats in my heart
good enough for me
things never shared
things that don't mean much to me
things never shared
things that don't mean much to me
i'm on my gaurd
wait until you see
sometime , what's in my heart
good enough , for me
it was good enough , for me
it was good enough , for me
