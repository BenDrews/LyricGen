now you know how i go
still you stay with me
still you stay with me
eight long years
you've been here
still you stay with me
still you stay with me
all i share all you bare
still you stay with me
still you stay with me
gentle words go unheard
still you stay with me
still you stay with me
when it's rough call my bluff
still you stay with me
still you stay with me
darlin please on my knees
will you stay with me
will you stay with me
