can we control this dream ?
make amends with lovers constructs
quieting the roar of doom
dream of the monster sick and frail
happened again last night
woke up hourly buzzing
wanted to escape my limbs
and the servitude of death
how many times i've seen
passenger jetplanes stopping in midair
falling and crash in front of me
being suprised that this time its for real
