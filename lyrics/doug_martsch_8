if you you are lonely you're not alone
if you can dance you
don't need a home
men are from mars and
mars is my enemy
clouds are on fire
telling the sun to burn me
started last summer
somebody said
don't let the future
go to your head
some say its funny
some say it isn't fair
go tell somebody
who knows how to act like they care
after i play there for the mars
looking around
so much i've found
i can't seem to get a lift
i can't seem to get a lift
