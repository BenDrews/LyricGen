ice on my neck cost me ten times three
thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
i just hit rod√©o and i spent like ten gs
i just did a show and spent the check on my mama
when i go on vacay i might rent out the bahamas
and i keep like ten phones , damn i'm really never home
all these niggas clones , tryna copy what i'm on
nigga get your own , tryna pick a nigga bone
word to brother skip , boy i had a good day
metro pcs trappin' , boy i'm makin' plays
fifty shades of grey , beat that pussy like hulk hogan
i know you know my slogan , if it ain't 'bout guap i'm gone
niggas hatin' 'cause i'm chosen from the concrete i had rose
shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
put that dick up in her pussy , bet she feel it in her toes
i'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
i'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows

in the middle of the party , bitch get off me
in the cut i'm rollin' up my broccoli
ya i know your baby mama fond of me
all she want to do is smoke that broccoli
whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me
said that i can get that pussy easily
said that i can hit that shit so greasily
i'm a dirty dog , i did it sleazily

she don't do it 'less i say so
i don't smoke if it ain't fuego
i should sauce 'em up like prego
fettucini with alfredo
all i wanted was the fame and every game they made on sega
i was five or six years old when i had told myself , " okay you're special "
but i treat you like my equal never lesser
i was twenty - six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
had the world steppin'
that's what i call epic
couple summers later i got paper
i acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
with the capers on a square plate
at the restaurant with the " why you got to stare " face
to know i either ball or i record over the snare and bass
rapper face , dread headed
golden diamond teeth wearin'
they just mad cause i got that cheese , bitch , i keep dairy
turnt up in the party gettin' lit to yachty
with a spanish barbie , word to my mami
in the middle of the party , bitch get off me ( get off of me )
in the cut i'm rollin' up my broccoli ( my weed , my weed )
ya i know your baby mama fond of me ( she fond of me )
all she want to do is smoke that broccoli
( my weed , my weed )
whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me
( she vulnerable )
said that i can let that pussy easily
( she fallin' for )
said i can hit that shit so greasily ( oh yeah , oh yeah )
i'm a dirty dog i did it sleazily
