shorty this gon' be your favorite song
dj drama
and this is the remix
baby , i don't know about you , but my wish came true
matter of fact , let me take you on another round
told her save my number under " big dipper "
got her wishin' on a star
save my number under " big tipper "
got her blowin' kisses from the bar
i , wish you could stay , but when you walk away
you look delicious from far
she roll up on me then they get lit
girl you my swisher cigar
shorty rather lay by the pool side
than stay by a fool's side
been sleepin' on yourself too long
time to flip the pillow over to the cool side
don't need the tea , baby , i got the juice
you wanna hang , baby , i got the noose
i got the ace , baby , i got the deuce
i gotta beat baby like i produce
come through the stu' , let you hear somethin' nice
bring that shit back , let you hear somethin' twice
ask how to keep drama clear from her life
said , " i don't know , girl , but here's some advice
stop bein' friendly to the fuckboys
stop bein' friendly to the fuckboys
stop bein' friendly to the fuckboys
stop bein' friendly to the fuckboys "
hold up , i'm who you've been cravin' for
the one that you save it for
hop in the shower and shave it for
come and watch power the day before
lay up with me while your man be suspicious
rub your booty 'til you grant me three wishes
i'ma hit for every call that she misses
every time i shoot my shot it be swishin'
have that ass wishing that i was your nigga
every time i shoot my shot it be swishin'
this the remix so i know what she wishin'
i hit it once and she want me to stroke again
i get it wet like a super soaker gun ( i like it ! )
now she lookin' for me like i'm on the run
she think i'm the one , say she finna cum
she gon' bust it , she gon' bust it , bust it , i know
when she suck it , she don't ever touch it , oh no ( i like it ! )
she be screamin' , " beat it up " , then she beggin' , " go soft "
then she tell me , " speed it up " , now she beggin' , " no more "
i go crazy on your spot
tickle , tickle , lick a lot , then she kiss the tippy top
then it turn to slippy sloppy
didn't waste not a drop when she cop me
i got the juice , she let it splash on me ( nasty )
know i'm the truth , ain't gotta ask 'bout me
baby you know who i am and girl i know just who you are
we ain't gotta rush into shit 'cause being in love is too hard
i'm tired of all these flashin' lights , girl we should just fuck in the dark
once you let me in it , i'ma get to switchin' , different positions
have that ass wishin' that i was your nigga
wishin' that i was your nigga , yeah yeah yeah
wishin' that i was your nigga , yeah
once you let me in it , i'ma get to switchin' , different positions
have that ass wishin' that i was your nigga

'cause i've been right here and i heard every word you was sayin'
you've been complainin'
well who did it , baby ? and do you need savin' ?
well i'll be your savior
from all of your exes that you've been regrettin'
you shouldn't be sweatin' them
i can do you better
i'll be your mothafuckin' genie in a bottle
rub me down , you can fuck me 'til tomorrow
'til the sun come up , yeah
i'm grantin' all of your wishes
i ain't nothin' like none of these bitches
and i'll have you wishin' that i was your woman
oh it got realer
i cannot feel her
i know my ex bitch is tryna front , but don't
no i'm not tiller
tell a ho i'm godzilla
monster in the wet wet , i kill it

hit it so hard you believe i nailed it down
hit it , but i held shit down

all on the corner , go hustlin' on it
just so i could take you out of town
