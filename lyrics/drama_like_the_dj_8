can't nothing beat the failure but a try
well i'm trying to get me some money
bitch want to fucking lay up all night
well i'm trying to get me some money
i can't wait to stay down 'til i get right
well i'm trying to get me some money
sending packs state to state whatever flavor you like
long as you sending your money
i just want the money baby , i just want the money
i just want the money baby , i just want the money
i just want the money baby , i just want the money
i just want the money baby , i just want the money
run it up then i fuck on every bitch that i like
all she wanted was two hunna
bricks in the fender , bags in the trunk of the honda
that bitch ain't goin' chasing that money
no i'm not new to this money
i'm so consistent with thumbing
trap that bitch spot before she get a single buck
that o.j. mayo like i play for the bucks
slam dunking from the a to the gump
good clean came in , went and criss crossed them
hit with the beater watch it come back
you ain't seen a nigga face in the trap in a while
must've thought i fucked up ain't coming back
i send my shooters come in back - to - back
that's just because of my social status
bitch mad that a nigga hit the trap all night
ain't got the time to get the groceries baby
they pull up to the trap like vultures
longway consistent in motion
watching the pack just scatter like roaches
the spot on beta ( ? ) , beat it down , got ghost
i just want the money baby , i just want the money
i just want the money baby , i just want the money
i’m trying to see the pyrex hit the pot
hitting the baby to 125
i hit the block like omar on the wire
a pump in my trench coat for the disguise
i go for the gusto chasing the blue benjamins
i might go longways road running with pies
pull up like 2 man in the trunk for the buck
i’m just gone fuck that bitch ain’t gone lay up
i just want the money baby
and no bitch we not going back and forth
turn the whole spot to the trap house resort
put 2 - 3 ounces in them baby pull ups
when i answer my phone i’m like pull up
i got pounds of og i can’t wait to zip up
learned from the og’s go go get at them bucks
momma said don’t you never give up
i hit the street got the sleek and no fucks
i just want to see my shoe boxes fill up ( cash )
i just want the money baby
no codefendant don’t fuck with niggas that ain’t handling business
convo bout money when we eat at benni’s
don’t got no time to go back and forth with bitches
i overnight it everytime i send it
get the pack and trap it out the trenches
you know what i mean
when i picked the name dj drama
its like a gift and a curse
even when i don't be looking for it or asking for it
i done had the fame
i done had the ups i done had the downs
success is good , but after ten years strong nigga just cut me the check
i got my feet kicked up , i just want the money
