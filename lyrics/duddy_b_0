i'm droppin beats , nice and mellow
meet you , i say hello
jump on the microphone
i got the fellas sayin' well , uh
damn , yo this boy come shockin'
and no , i don't stop until i'm done rockin'
so yo , just sit back and relax for a bit
i'll spit my shit then i quit
like the biz , then i rip it
i'm high as can be , the true duddy b
and all can see we comin' irie , yeah , yeah
yeah , irie , yeah , yeah
yeah , irie
i'm on a stag , my booze up on the very highest shelf
( yo , stay true to my friends and get wise with myself )
cause i'm impaired with despair at all you sucker mcs
( so be yourself and flow with ease
and keep it tight like dungarees )
and get this cheese like cheddar
( drop the fake act and grab these beats that be better )
'cause i be breakin' fools
with molecules and lots of juice
your neck in the noose , i'm lettin it loose , yo
( when you turn purple , get out my circle
if you got that shit that be commercial )
'cause i found ya sound , just be the other way around
( you're tryin' to be underground
but you floatin' on the surface )
with no purpose in your verses
( drop the mic so you can jerk it )
*can it be the mc rockin under canopies
insanity is banning me from rappin' independently*
and sending me to penitentiaries offensively
( cause i love music ) , i chose it , don't abuse it
never lose it when i bruise it
( so don't lyrically shoot , cause you know you're gonna miss )
you say you get more pussy than a gynecologist
( i know you would be lonely if it wasn't for your fist )
you asked me how i got dope
i said lots of prac - a - prac - a - tice
i got no time for y'all
we got to keep movin' , yeah
i've got to move on , move on from here , yeah
i got no time for y'all
we got to keep movin' , yeah
i've got to move on , move on from here , yeah
well , buenos noches
steppin' on fools like cockroaches
i be callin' plays like some fuckin' football coaches
fallin' asleep because i know your shit is boring
cut you so hard , you'll straight up need some neosporin
said i'm raining on your head , because yo , my shit is pourin'
your eyes get dilated cause all your hits is faded
i need to be sedated like my main man dutty b
sick to your stomach when you find an ill mc
with the symphony , the illest infantry
drops you down for the century
the illest penalty
said i know i'm hard to see
i kill myself , but leave my entity
but jump up off a track like a cricket
make it jiminy
original citadel , head bob
four star general
i find mine with my tentacle
my rhyme style's identical to none
you bite me , end up like your grandfather
straight chewin' with your gums
it's the dj selector
comin' hard on the record with the effort , full effect
dj science , break your neck when tongues twist syllables
trick our lips to make hits
never leave you unfulfilled like a hooker with one tit
a group with one hit
gettin' loose off one sip
we the sunshine mcs
so i think you best to quit
( yes , i think it's time to quit )
yo , you know you it's best to quit
*yes , i think it's time to quit , yo*
i got no time for y'all
we got to keep movin' , yeah
i've got to move on , move on from here , yeah
i got no time for y'all
we got to keep movin' , yeah
i've got to move on , move on from here , yeah
