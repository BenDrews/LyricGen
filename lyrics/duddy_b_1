i am everything that i said i am
keep my shit tight , man , motherfuckin' hoover dam
and i ain't cracking anytime soon , my mind said it's fine - tuned
this world will be mine soon
show down at high noon , sharp as a harpoon
crash like a monsoon , style like a costume
i'm constantly awesome
voice fresh as spring , yo my beats bout to blossom
caution , get out the pit when i'm moshin'
my friends are all high , yeah , i'm nice and i got 'em that way
we bulls on parade
my bowl's full of weed , man , higher than a pterodactyl
you can call me caveman , california raisin
hear me through the grapevine
duddy b be dazed again , but man i'm feelin' just fine
i be out in vegas while ya bitches just at state line
i ain't never stoppin' til' i finally feel i got mine
we're never gonna lay down , we ain't going nowhere
you can come and give a try
our bond is our blood and thicker than water
like goonies , never say die
ooh 'cause goonies never say
ooh 'cause goonies never say die
i keep it cool , right , i'm like an avalanche
i get stupid when i want to , rain man
i keep it flowing now , i do the rain dance
man , everybody loves me , call me raymond
here i go , i be gettin' so high like i'm standing on my tippy toes
spread my wings and fly , but i got two arms where my wings should go
hungry as an animal , tearin' down the devil's door
he's sellin' me his soul for all the lyrics in my arsenal
eyes red , lungs full , half - masted flag pole
i'm about to kill this beat and throw it in a drowning pool
hair long , style cool , lyrics fresh , jet fuel
on this track , no lookin back , i'm hippie like a hacky sac
smoother than a cadillac , leave mcs needing medi - vac
yeah i lost my shit , but bitch , you know i got my passion back
locked inside my temper trap , i'm laughin' at y'all pussycats
'cause i ain't never stopping 'til the top is what i'm lookin' at
we never gonna lay down , we ain't going nowhere
you can come and give a try
our bond is our blood and thicker than water
like goonies , never say die
ooh 'cause goonies never say
ooh 'cause goonies never say die
okay listen up , kiddos , i'm a shark , you're a minnow
balls on your chin , call your bitch jay leno
don't go swimmin' 'cause your shit sounds menstrual
and we ain't here to play dr. dre , south central
spit barbiturates to make you rub your tits and shit
have your body moving , shaking hips and throwing fits
willie sittin' high , just as i
the time is nigh , now i'm floorin' my delorean , marty mcfly yeah , anybody home , two spliffs to the dome
it's a headshot , dread not , noobs get pwned
yeah i fucking said it , it was so last year
i got a pack full of gear and a trunk full of beers
we're never gonna lay down , we ain't going nowhere
you can come and give a try
our bond is our blood and thicker than water
like goonies , never say die
we're never gonna lay down , we ain't going nowhere
you can come and give a try ( ooh 'cause goonies never say )
our bond is our blood and thicker than water
like goonies , never say die ( ooh 'cause goonies never say )
( we're never gonna lay down , we ain't going nowhere

ooh 'cause goonies never say
( we're never gonna lay down , we ain't going nowhere
you can come and give a try )
ooh 'cause goonies never say die
