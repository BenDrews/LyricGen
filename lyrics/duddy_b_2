well , my , hat brim might be worn a little too low
you're too slow , what the fuck do you really think you know
i do so , and every rhyme that i spit is just so crucial
like metamucil , i kill some rhymes that i'm used to
you park so high and mighty , but i'm not mighty high
duddy smoke you out with weed and leave your mouth fucking dry
cause some of them rappin' , clappin' , laughin'
always beer tappin' , fuckin' dorkette slapping
be ridiculous at how i'm trippin'
is all i'm thinking is this the best mc that you can find
i shine like some moonlight through the pine
yo , and even if you were wine
i'd still stay dope up with my line
well if you generally irie
then roll with the stylie
duddy " smokin' cali green leaf 'til i die " b
leave me alone when i'm chilling in my home
yo , i'm smooth like a schwinn and i shine like the chrome
of its fender , remember this microphone defender
return your shit to sender cause no one wants to hear it
yo , your lyrics are weak and yes your spirit's meek
and you an ignant motherfucker , yes it shows when you speak
you're a wicked disappointment , your rhymes need some ointment
the crowd at your shows always laughing and pointin'
leavin' and blewin' , my boy has been groovin'
and i'm still backstage just smokin' and boozin'
confusin' the sets , save the best for my choosin'
i'm choosin' the rest so you're losin'
well , don't forget about the down and dirty southern cali flow
just open the melody and let the rhythm go
i'm hoofing up the track just like a bouncing antelope
and soften up your skoal just like a ripened cantaloupe
because the west ( west ) coast ( coast ) knows how to kill it
yo , and y'all ( y'all ) know ( know ) when its time to feel it
yo , we make it right ( make it right )
so we up all night ( up all night )
until it's tight ( until it's tight )
until it's tight ( until it's tight )
a bohemian rhapsody , these syllables after me
with lyrical chastity and verbally blasphemy
the illest we have to be , with musical masterpiece
so come on and clap with me , so come on and clap with me
( so come on and clap with me )
just come on and clap with me
( so come on and clap with me )
yo , just come on and clap with me
once upon a time in the neighborhood
there was a little dirty boy that was up to no good
he had a chip in his tooth and a mic in his hand
he had a dirty - ass head from the beach and the sand
he said , i just got out of the water and i'm late for school
i asked duddy to skip and he said , that's cool
so we went to the liquor store , got ourselves some magnums
rollin' down the street , yeah , you know we brown bagged 'em
with the 50s on top and the 20s on bottom
said we rollin' through my hood , yeah , you know we got 'em
sucker mcs wanna battle me , but that's okay
i tell 'em , don't fuck around because we don't play
i sang rock out with my cock out , i got balls of steel
hear me clanking down the street like a bag of beer
said the dance off session , gonna start right here
duddy b , grab the wheel , cause i can't steer
you got 20 - inch rims and they spinnin' when you stop
said i don't give a fuck , kill it when the beat drops
cause that's what i respect , to all you knuckle heads and derelicts
just jammin down the sound with the syllables and intellect
maybe not the intellect , but the syllables are clean
and i leave you in the desert with an empty canteen
while i be rippin' shows from here to galapagos
and i be pickin' foes like i'm pickin' a fro
and all you chicken head hoes
that come to picket my shows
you got to go
