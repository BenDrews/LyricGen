i need some valium , xanex , percocet
darvocet , vicodin , klonopin , sleeping pills and nyquil
i can't sleep , yo
and it's driving me mad
it's like my eyelids are glued to the top of my forehead
i lie in bed with my eyes wide open
but duddy , don't you worry you'll be sleeping in a moment
then moments turn minutes and minutes turn to hours
then hours turn to long - ass nights and cold showers
it's four in the morning , still wide awake
let's see how many bong tokes duddy b can take
already drank all the alcohol left in my house
now i sit here wide awake with a dry fucking mouth
and i just think of all the things on my mind
and then i let 'em roll around in there a million times
until it's got me , 'til it grabs ahold of me , baby
it's insomnia kids , you know it's driven me crazy
turn out the lights lie my head down
i lie my head down , i close my eyes
now all i do , girl , is lie here
i think i'll die here , insomnia
push my face in the pillow to asphyxiate the sound
i'd cry myself to sleep , but i'm too scared that i might drown
i'm calling for the sandman , but i don't think he's in town
and all these sleepless nights and running thoughts have got me down
i wish i got a sudden case of narcolepsy
maybe call up duddy b so we can spark the best weed
give me something nice so it can calm my chest peace
and talk about some things that we really don't need
as i lay in bed , in my head i'm running circles
stuck in the land of low light and infomercials
its insomnia kids , you know it's drivin' me crazy
only thing that can save me is an overdose maybe
turn out the lights lie my head down
i lie my head down , i close my eyes
now all i do , girl , is lie here
i think i'll die here , insomnia
fallin' , fallin' , tryin' to fall asleep
i can't see nothin' , cause my eyes are just too weak
fallin' , fallin' , tryin' to fall asleep
fallin' , fallin' cause my eyes are just too weak
turn out the lights lie my head down
i lie my head down , i close my eyes
now all i do , girl , is lie here
i think i'll die here , insomnia
