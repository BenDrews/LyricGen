all hyped up , ready to begin
styrofoam mc's keep crumbling
dirty heads stay tight , couldn't loosen with a wrench
these rivers run deep , mariana trench
pickin' up speed , easy round the bend
eye on the scope , target focused in
my guitar is my gun , i strum it like the wind
zoomed in on the pulse of the nation once again
so don't wait for me my friend
i'm just wasting time again
so day by day , i will move on ( day by day )
can't stop now , it's been too long
day by day , i will grow stronger ( day by day )
strides i take , they will grow longer
day by day , step by step ( day by day )
live my life , no regrets
day by day , i will keep movin' on , day by day
bright lights on
coming off the hinge
rambling on like a led zeppelin
i got my sword and my pen like mad mordagin
outta the abyss starting to ascend
top of the class , peak of the summit
throw your worries of a cliff , watch them as they plummet
bandana and a harp playin' while you're strumming
bobby mcgee and duddy b while your humming like
so don't wait for me my friend
i'm just wasting time again
so day by day , i will move on ( day by day )
can't stop now , it's been too long
day by day , i will grow stronger ( day by day )
strides i take , they will grow longer
day by day , step by step ( day by day )
live my life , no regrets
day by day , i will keep movin' on , day by day
moving forward , beyond the borders
( take warning ) , my day has come
stop for nothing , wait for no one
( take warning ) , my day has come
( take warning ) , my day has come
so day by day , i will move on ( day by day )
can't stop now , it's been too long
day by day , i will grow stronger ( day by day )
strides i take , they will grow longer
day by day , step by step ( day by day )
live my life , no regrets
day by day , i will keep movin' on , day by day
