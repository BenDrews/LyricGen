waking up to instrumentals playing , smoke up in the ceiling fan
complicated wordplay but really i'm a simple man
i like my weather good , i like my women hood
i keep it one hundred , and get misunderstood
don't get my words twisted now , we ain't all the same
some got a silver spoon , others have a ball and chain
some wish you all the best , some wish you all the pain
life's a game and i'm trying to make the hall of fame
this society asks you to pick a side
every minute of your life , three hundred and sixty five
red or blue , big or small , yes or no , right or wrong
the difference between the two is the feeling of i belong
yeah , we in the middle of all this
the temperature's rising like the middle of august
they litter the airwaves , you pick up the garbage
big dreams coming out this little apartment
all i know is keep it cool
i stay calm
they ask me " how you do that ? " " what is this fool on ? "
a little bit of this , a little bit of that
it's the whole lot of nothing that keeps me on track
all i know is keep it cool
i stay calm
they ask me " how you do that ? " " what is this fool on ? "
a little bit of this , a little bit of that
it's the whole lot of nothing that keeps me on track
never reached six digits in my bank account
credit score red , same color that i paint the town
three month relationship , tells me she can't wait around
you can break me down , as long as my fam's safe and sound
i keep the weed lit , and keep my glass full
i call it real talk , they call it asshole
i call it on the grind , she calls it selfish
she needs me all the time , i call her helpless
is it a problem that i don't care
maybe that's the reason that i'm stuck at almost there , it's no fair
on this path , there's no warnings or road flares
all is fair in love games and warfare
another underdog story for the books
but i promise that the story is as foreign as i look
waiting at the bus stop to touring on a bus
when the going gets tough , i keep it up
all i know is keep it cool
i stay calm
they ask me " how you do that ? " " what is this fool on ? "
a little bit of this , a little bit of that
it's the whole lot of nothing that keeps me on track
all i know is keep it cool
i stay calm
they ask me " how you do that ? " " what is this fool on ? "
a little bit of this , a little bit of that
it's the whole lot of nothing that keeps me on track
