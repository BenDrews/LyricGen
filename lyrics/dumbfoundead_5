you took me as safe
that was your first mistake
who said i was safe
the other night i watched the oscars
and the roster of the only yellow men were all statues
we a quarter of the population
there’s a room of fuckin’ 1 percenters laughing at you
fuck a bamboo ceiling , guess i gotta play the villain
odb up at the grammys on the mic
like “wu - tang is for the children ! ”
bruce jenner is a woman
oj was acquitted
kim k is a hero
the sky is the limit , any minute now
they gonna let an asian brotha’ get a lead role
shots fired i'mma reload , never saw this side of chino
he was always quiet keeping to himself
never messed with anybody else
that's the jonathan that we know
seems so safe , till one day things go cray
i swear if things don’t change
my actions can’t be blamed , ( stand up ! )
and now you gotta duck !
you know you never gave a fuck !
i came to get my cut ! ( fuck you , pay me )
you know i never gave a fuck !
i ain't never heard of none y’all fools
i can do what every one of y’all do
if i never get a chance
you might see the homie show up on the 5 o’ clock news
you ain't never seen a yellow boy wild’n yellow boy shinin’ , sound the alarm i got news
go ahead and pro - file em’ i ain't pro - violence
shhhhh , silence is how yellow boys move
its been the same ol’ thang , i swear the game don’t change
what you talking bout there ain't no space
guess i gotta go and make more space
you know i’m cool as a motherfucker
chillin’ in the cut hella quiet with the loud pack
since i’m a cool motherfucker
you think everything is safe till i ask you where the safe at !
seems so safe , till one day things go cray
i swear if things don’t change
my actions can’t be blamed , ( stand up ! )
and now you gotta duck !
you know you never gave a fuck !
i came to get my cut ! ( fuck you , pay me )
you know i never gave a fuck !
you took me as safe
that was your first mistake
