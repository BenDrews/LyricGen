girl i need to drop you
because on the real , you're too high school
yelling on my voicemail
why you gotta be so hostile
i'm looking for a love life
you addicted to them club lights
way you're always in my face though
man it's almost like you love fights
by the way , i hate your guy friends
did you have to invite them ?
actually , your girls too
chickenheads , never like them
why the hell you always broke boo
but always got a pair of dope shoes
oh , you need to borrow money right ?
girl you're turning into old news
i need a new chick
why we never have sex , yo
can i get some head though
you know a man has needs
bullshitting about strep throat
got me feeling mad stressed
always bringing up the past tense
now i understand your last ex
and why he bounced like a bad check
feeling frustrated , looking for an upgrade
current situation got me boiling in my blood veins
out to find a new chick
down to earth , cool chick
have a future with her , start a tribe like q - tip
i could be your phife dawg love
my last chick ain't even know who phife dawg was
i was like " oh , what ? "
how we gon' get along
if you don't know any songs on midnight marauders
but your ipod's looking so straight
going down your playlist , think i found my soul mate
it's been only four dates and you're so much cooler
why the hell did i wait , should've broken up sooner
damn
i never knew a love like this
my last girl never showed me love like this
she ain't never go to my shows or bump my shit
but you , you love my shit
on and on this shit goes
the homies tell me go on and leave her alone
i'll be god damned , she got the best dome
back and forth in my ear
always on the verge of bursting in tears
even got the nerve to flirt with my peers
but you got the best dome
