back from being black balled
here to slap all them stupid cats doin bath salts
korean jesus , droppin panties to the asphalt
got them asian bitches getting freaky to them trap songs
baptized with the water in the glass bong
turned water into soju , got your facts wrong
if you trying to learn i teach a junior college class on it
throw the money in the basket , put a couple racks on it
took me 20 years to grow this fuckin goatee
it'll take another 40 years for you to shave it off me
i'm on that sensei swag with the wise look
chicks dig it even make the nuns wanna dry hump
never drive drunk , but i do it high as hell
cruisin in koreatown might as well
im adele , bitter at my ex , ima tell
the world about her ft. lauderdale pictures of her breasts , next
chillin in the bat cave , stackin mad tracks
i ain't never had a half day
your shit's wack you should smash on the backspace
fuck all your videos , i’d rather watch the ads play
gotten more ass than them ads for them axe sprays
sprained my damn back trynna do the latest dance craze
dopin’ up with lance , pedalin’ that good man made
take two of these and it’ll leave you in a trance daze
k - town jesus , rockin open toed addidas
rollin zig zags and reefer with a big bag of cheez - its
its beanie season i don’t need a fucking reason
no matter the degrees , if its heated or its freezing
back but i never left , heaven sent raps from the devils breath
leanin to the left , like a treble clef , respect don’t get your panties in a knot
buddha blessed , with muhammad trying to hotbox with gods
you don't know who korean jesus is ?
what , you stupid or something ?
the man who turned water into soju , you don't know who he is ?
you think somebody better than korean jesus ?
he is the reason why asian people are so cheap
he took a single loaf of bread and fish , and fed a thousand people
you try and do that shit !
bitch , why don't you try and walk on water ?
fuck criss angel !
korean jesus saves you like korean people save zip lock bags after one use
he is forever with me like a kimchi stain on a white t - shirt
korean jesus was the original k - town hipster , wearing sandals and a full beard
you're welcome
