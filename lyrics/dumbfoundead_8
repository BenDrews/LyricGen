hey , let's get one thing clear
i want a new life , a new life
hey , lets get one thing clear ;
there’s much more stardust , when you’re near
just woke up , what i miss ?
smoke one up in the morning
fell asleep with the tv on
and had me dreams of being on conan
yea i'm zonin' , hit that shower
with my new girl for an hour ( for an hour ? )
fuck the neighbors
last few nights man , we were louder
got my bags packed , and my passport
didn't unpack from the last tour
sold my merch
i made me bank and i ain't talkin' backboard
stack more , stack more
shoulda wrote that on that blackboard
what the fuck is school for
if you end up livin' mad poor ?
that gpa don't matter when you're climbin' up my ladder
they will stab you with that dagger
for your status , do you gather ?
what you did and how you did it , no one gives a fuck at all
where you going , how you get it , you should focus on that mo'
i'm on that brand new , that old shit i put that in the attic
neck and wrist got 24 karats
i'm one happy rabbit
all that talk about your talent is as old as my machallan
lets see a lot more action and less talkin' charlie chaplin
hey , let's get one thing clear
i want a new life , a new life
hey , lets get one thing clear
there much more stars , coming in
hey , where you hidin' , i'm writin'
my future , on a diamond
i'm johnny , i'm manziel , that freshman with the heisman
i'm malcolm i'm gladwell , that tipping point , is risin'
real life movie streets are watching' , like a drive in
5 stars , masterpiece , got the critics ravin'
fly far , master p , theres no limitations
first class , never knew they gave 'em all this extra shit
you can lean your seat back all the way , on some stretcher shit
too good , life is too good , when your livin'
its that hd vision no more fuckin' with antennas
ha , i'm just buyin' now
got more hoes than a firehouse
way more o's in my bank account
it looks like i been buyin' vowels
i'm dinin' out
no need for reservations
all originals
used to rock them imitations
bought from chinatown , ( town )
and them hand me downs , ( downs )
i'm lookin' dapper , ain't ever getting patted down
hey , let's get one thing clear
i want a new life , a new life
hey , lets get one thing clear
there’s much more stardust , when you’re near
hey , let's get one thing clear
i want a new life , a new life
hey , lets get one thing clear
there’s much more stardust , when you’re near
