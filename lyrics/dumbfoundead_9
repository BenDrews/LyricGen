let the beat hit you with a big bang , make the girls dip low
people taking pics , click , pause , for a quick pose
armored cars , body guards rocking thick trench coats
if you get close then you might get your wig blown
d to the fd , fly as a frisbee
fans with their hands holding signs saying kiss me
cup full of whiskey , pocket full of weed
got a catalog of bangers , ipod full of ds
yo , it's killah california , sorry i didn't inform yah
but it serves your favorite rapper like anna kournikova
my freestyle game is even nicer than your written emcee's
i've slain need vicoddin prescriptions
yeah , get your zani bars up
got these kids looking at me like i'm daddy warbucks ( ? )
all you trust fund babies , please hand me your trust
and i'll double your money by fucking challenger's up ( ? )
you can shoot crazy videos with cannon 5ds
use youtube and ustream satillite feds
wear my clothes , and my shoes , and have my id
but it won't ever turn you into a rapper like me
where's dumb from ? it's probably andromeda
styles off the chart that blew up the damn monitors
we've never had a reading like this on the swaggometer
no body wanna see me , call me your tax auditor
h&r block flow catch me on your blog post
to given out free shit like oprah's talk show
you get one , you get one , and you too
look under your seat there's a dub sack glued to
and on the last day of 2010 and i was with the homie wax
talking bout the taking over sippin on some cognac
cutie with a booty passed by we made a toast to that
changing up the industry like they did with the zodiac
yessir , man i'm spittin straight crack
makin ya'll look stupid like gucci maine's face tat
ha , brr it's getting cold in here
i'm taking rap back to it's golden years
check it , they got these asians stereotypes what's with that
my dick's big , i drive good , and i suck at math
but i can fucking rap so watch your fucking mouth
before i do some martial arts shit and punch you out
i'm not the timid type , i live the city life
got just the right amount of arrogance that women like
i drink and smoke la vida loca
i'm tryna run la call me villaraigosa
2011 you're gonna hear a whole lot of me
i'm making better music then most of these grammy nominees
their albums been going platinum and mines just went mahogany
but i ain't really trippin , cause one day they're gonna honor me
in the past year i've aquired a little web fame
met a lot of haters , and liars with in the net game
got a little buzzed but i ain't even full of head change
too busy getting my bars up , catch phrase
i ain't a silly kid doing video blogs
if i did them as a youth it would be the city of god
cause i was more into robberies than getting a job
i just shut this shit down , turn the internet off
i said that bubba bubba , that bubba bubba kush kush
that bubba bubba , that bubba bubba , kush kush
that bubba bubba , that bubba bubba , kush kush
that bubba bubba , that bubba bubba , kush kush
