dark in the city night is a wire
steam in the subway earth is afire
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
woman you want me give me a sign
and catch my breathing even closer behind
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
in touch with the ground
i'm on the hunt down i'm after you
smell like i sound i'm lost in a crowd
and i'm hungry like the wolf
straddle the line in discord and rhyme
i'm on the hunt down i'm after you
mouth is alive with juices like wine
and i'm hungry like the wolf
stalked in the forest too close to hide
i'll be upon you by the moonlight side
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
high blood drumming on your skin it's so tight
you feel my heat i'm just a moment behind
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
in touch with the ground
i'm on the hunt down i'm after you
scent and a sound. i'm lost and i'm found
and i'm hungry like the wolf
strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
i howl and i whine i'm after you
mouth is alive all running inside
and i'm hungry like the wolf
hungry like the wolf
hungry like the wolf
hungry like the wolf
burning the ground i break from the crowd
i'm on the hunt down i'm after you
i smell like i sound. i'm lost and i'm found
and i'm hungry like the wolf
strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
i'm on the hunt down i'm after you
mouth is alive with juices like wine
and i'm hungry like the wolf
