came in from a rainy thursday
on the avenue
thought i heard you talking softly
i turned on the lights , the tv
and the radio
still i can't escape the ghost of you
what has happened to it all ?
crazy , some'd say
where is the life that i recognize ?
gone away
but i won't cry for yesterday
there's an ordinary world
somehow i have to find
and as i try to make my way
to the ordinary world
i will learn to survive
passion or coincidence
once prompted you to say
" pride will tear us both apart "
well now pride's gone out the window
cross the rooftops
run away
left me in the vacuum of my heart
what is happening to me ?
crazy , some'd say
where is my friend when i need you most ?
gone away
but i won't cry for yesterday
there's an ordinary world
somehow i have to find
and as i try to make my way
to the ordinary world
i will learn to survive
papers in the roadside
tell of suffering and greed
here today , forgot tomorrow
ooh , here besides the news
of holy war and holy need
ours is just a little sorrowed talk
and i don't cry for yesterday
there's an ordinary world
somehow i have to find
and as i try to make my way
to the ordinary world
i will learn to survive
every one
is my world , i will learn to survive
any one
is my world , i will learn to survive
any one
is my world
every one
is my world
