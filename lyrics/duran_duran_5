mine , immaculate dream made breath and skin
i've been waiting for you
signed , with a home tattoo
happy birthday to you was created for you
( can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams )
( can not believe you've taken my heart to pieces )
oh , it'll take a little time
might take a little crime
to come undone now
we'll try to stay blind
to the hope and fear outside
hey child , stay wilder than the wind
and blow me into cry
who do you need , who do you love
when you come undone ?
who do you need , who do you love
when you come undone ?
words , playing me deja vu
like a radio tune i swear i've heard before
chills , is it something real
or the magic i'm feeding off your fingers ?
( can not forgive from falling apart at the seams )
( can not believe you're taking my heart to pieces )
lost , in a snow filled sky
we'll make it alright
to come undone now
we'll try to stay blind
to the hope and fear outside
hey child , stay wilder than the wind
and blow me into cry
who do you need , who do you love
when you come undone ?
who do you need , who do you love
when you come undone ?
( can not forgive from falling apart )
who do you need , who do you love
when you come undone ?
( can not forgive from falling apart )
who do you need , who do you love ?
( can not forgive from falling apart )
who do you love
when you come undone ?
( can not forgive from falling apart )
