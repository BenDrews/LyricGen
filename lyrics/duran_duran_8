it's beautiful , the dying sun
the end of everything and everyone
so shall we make a clan my friend
as if we have the chance to live it all again
i'll see you in some other lifetime
on the other side of what we'll never know
together we have walked a fine line
now we go to face the universe alone
in plain view , the mistakes we've made
but is there anything you'd really want to change ?
to win and lose then win again
to have it all then throw it all away
i'll see you in some other lifetime
on the other side of what we'll never know
together we have walked a fine line
now we go to face the universe alone
how beautiful the closing down
the fading out , it spins and goes around
with darkness and the heart of man
and here we are back where it all began
i'll see you in some other lifetime
the universe alone
the universe alone
the universe alone
