well i got something to say , you know what i mean
( yes )
i i haven't been on the radio before , you know , hey baby how you doing today ?
( haha )
you know i wanna say hello to my brother out there
( hey , a lot of folks been around )
ey bros
( thank you again )
( fine , enjoy the show )
this for all my muorrow niggas
*beastcoast*
pro era
*g shit*
it's phony ppl
*plain pat what up*
difference between me and you
you think you should have it and i deserve it
dwelling on the past and i'm in the lab working
never spoke to god in the hood , there's bad service
but i guess i got bars cause he sending 'em for certain
swanky sin , got critics questioning what lane he in
i'm just turning crowds into stadiums
pounds , i be blazin' the haze when i listen to waves
on the road searching for stones like jackie and jade
ain't shit fly unless i rock it
high like drop kicks in cockpits
red eye fly shit , holding chop sticks
split cheese with monsters
switching keys in partures
ain't pick a decent sponsor but bet i'll still archer
yo dymez , i got them , slow ride through gotham
the villandry black like i'm gothic
i be in the lab spitting topics
mixing toxics 'til the prophet's pockets profit
or 'til i get boxed in
t - shirt from polo , the rebirth of yolo
if i'm trying to find a pro though all i got to do is yodel
steaming on the low , got have me dreaming like a mogul
the humidity is killing me , i call that the ozone
capital swank , finally had the cash up in the bank
so the snakes want to ask me if i'm great
we laughing in your face cause rap was a mistake when the entrees came , they almost had me eating steak
this hip - hop with a fly feel
you'll be dead if you lie still
it's all about what you choose to do , buy steal
hood niggas like grim reapers , they soul takers , black hoodie bone breakers
put you to sleep , then you won't wake up
i mean , you could go from weight rooms to waiting rooms
be armed or curled up , when that piece to your chest , so make your move
no april fools , i just say the truth
gonna be a vacant tomb if you break the rules
( how about style , performance ? )
oh , style is , is , is , is cool man , you know
( mhm )
and i mean , it's got to be sharp
my gift is my curse if i lift it i burst
but fuck arms , i do enough harm when i'm kicking a verse
i heard niggas went missing , where the dirt is when you surface ?
what you mean i ain't earn this ?
they ask for my service
emotions in his flow caught a wave , now he surfin'
but notice these demons and serpents be lurkin'
it's urgent , still a rebel , fuck school , burn shit
don't ask him to pull up his pants up , it irks him
til i die of an overdose of the dopeness , i'm floating higher
flying above the coast and just scoping and getting wiser
i am a product of this box we call pop culture
creative pop filter bringing our collapse closer
batman of this rap scam , they gasp over
spit facts over these tracks , deeper than shaq's vox
dyme's dope , stay on my grind cause i know
that time slow , puffing that lye smoke but time don't
wait
you causing quakes when you're moving plates
illuminate , eliminate got me thinking that it's the same
won't let a flow like mine ever slip through the drain
cause i'm fit for the game , watch me shift through the planes
the rap monster boss is popping off if cops involved
shocked them all , dropping draws/jaws , now they chakras off
eating lobster sauce , stop it , dog , i'm above the law
led 'em on , weapons drawn , it's the art of war
i can feel it getting closer
as ls turn to clips
clips turn to roaches and those turn to bowl hits
oh shit , looks like we getting high again
that's another gramof fires right to my diaphragm
i blaze a dutch , then i pay the cut
you be on the wall posted up , trying to make a cuff
groupies on my arm just to prove that we swank enough
let me see you take a puff while i break it up
( fine , thank you very much sir )
yeah , thanks , look here man
( yes , mhm )
i sure appreciate you calling me all these things , because i don't be doing too many interviews and things
( well , fine , we appreciate your time and , uh )
yeah
( thank you once again )

( enjoy the other show , we'll talk to you again )
