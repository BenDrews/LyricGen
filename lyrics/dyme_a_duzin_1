brooklyn , new york is our hometown !
quarter waters , all aboard the trains in the summer days
i wipe my brow with a towel from the barclay's
daily news i refuse to bust the paper out
so when you eating chinese food make sure you pluck the staples out
o.g , kush got me floa - ting , i sold seed
got smoke and i don't speak , these streets never know sleep
breezing off the avenue , the cabbie's catch a attitude
five dollar phone chargers , but they not compatible
fuck a hipster , i'm a nigga , brooklyn born
banned everything but the liquor , ghetto qur'ans
i speak songs to the willing and the righteous
might just wine for the gal in the tight dress
fuck that , never disrespect a silly record
less it's disrespecting brooklyn , you'll get your live token
no you shouldn't , but you will , we armed and aimed to kill
brooklyn heavy weight you'll never take us under g for real
brooklyn , new york is our hometown !
hip - hop , hip - hop
dollar van to the jewelry man
something like a grand for these gold fangs , i'm from the county of kings
higher learning was a change , and why diesel inhaling grew wings
nah mean , zombie's the top example why they call a rotten apple
cut the tail off the city , rassle ain't no longer tattled
peep my bk point of view like that spike lee angle
rockefeller drug lords , or the judge might hang you
bk breezing warriors , the most notorious
but the bearer of the throne will always be the notorious one
mos def - initely , i'm feeling mighty fab , puffing on the jay
busting rhymes while the time past
birth place of tyson , jordan , get jackson'ed
nigga give me your wallet , bitches hand me your pocketbooks
replace the b with a c , brooklyn , home of the crooks
brooklyn , new york is our hometown !
brooklyn so proper , nigga what you be talking bout
rebels soul , indigo since my mama pop me out
enlightened sound we lords of the boom bap ask around
smoking loud , all my flatbush niggas love that sour pow
brooklyn we gutter , blocks patrolled by undercovers
innocent brothers go under for bag of ganja
but fuck that
beast coast bout to take over niggas know that
spitting that soul rap , disguised the flow so it sound like a throwback
they say you bringin 90’s back , alright i’m fine with that
but all i'm trying to do is bring the motherfucking honor back
where it started at , uhh , i'm a legend my g
and besides that astrals smoking hash with the master of this shit
elevated conglomerate , to the game that we fathered in
put away on some problem shit , for me to work om my proper bitch
them might beast coast is the holy chosen ones
like fucking moses , park , and fake from the real ones
that's it nigga
brooklyn , new york is our hometown !
live from the ghettos of flatbush where one bad look
could leave you sam cooked , that wasn't in your plan book right
hater , the light bearer , take flight to heights you scared of
preparing the youth for revolution through these booth intrusions
bringing our roots back , sun rays within our raps
gun plays outside the trap , 5 - 0 be on our backs
they try to box us in , but still i win
elevating the nation , young god , no satan , my nigga
stuff your brains with knowledge , power , respect
most hours lived , no regrets , since i was little a vet
now dollars what i collect , yes brooklyn raised me
dollar vans bumping jay - z , this my stop at the fronto spot
i cop a daily , bringing it back to the ave , mixing the hash
the sky's the limit i'm past , we the coldest cats in this rap
beast coast no way to infiltrate our craft
third eye strapped , defeating these demons within my past
the portrait is official , copped it like winslow
spark a pipe and bowl , sharpen my mental
junior high i used to fake sick and get sent home
high school i finally got to take a white chick home
cutting classes to smash , she was accustom to cum guzzling
barely even ducking when the nut would splash
insecurity she covered up with make - up
me ! ? i appreciated nuttin' on her face
now a days she ain't sucking then she basic
as a younger youngin' they would buffen me with braces
big booty honey's wanna cuff me cause i'm caking
piggy's smell the piffy , wanna cuff me cause i'm baking , the game dangerous
emcee's get slain remain nameless
or upstate corrected like they say sandwich
your gaining if your a game changer , embrace haters
they say love and hate is the same , ain't it ?
buddy i'm way too raw for you to trade places
and sure man your making dad so proud birthing your styles
now , i'm murking you out , enter the game verses the child
when we was on tour with the lvrs surfing the crowd
you was surfing the web , poking them hoes , look at you now
power trippin' , rappers be spazzing when the sour lift them
still roll with who i been with , the difference the cowards missing
bunch of devoured victims i pile them , and i don't miss em'
know it's a downer , but in these crowds you are non - existent
how would you feel if you arising where the suns at
and dumb cats are shooting while you flying so you comeback
they want me to walk , and telling me to run that bk never done that
i'm too far to hit them if i were to bust back , don't aim where the bums at
continue on my quest on becoming the greatest
and show the new new york to our generation
and if you don't know , then you know now , i'm flatbush , and i'm blowing loud
it's bk , it's beast coast , and i'm swankin for my hometown
cross the bridge , walk with me
tried to warn you but you all were sleep
we taking over , you boring me
my coast is here , and we all are beast
and we representin’ brooklyn , brooklyn
and we representin’ brooklyn , brooklyn
and we representin’ brooklyn , brooklyn
and we representin’ brooklyn , brooklyn
