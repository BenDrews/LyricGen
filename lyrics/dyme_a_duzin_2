and i hope you know to call me , as soon as you safe , when you first hit the ground and you get to your place
i got time , if you got time
when you made me yours , i made you mine

so when you so far , so gone , you're so far away , every face time , phone call , i just call to say : i love ya , i love ya , i love ya , i love ya

girl , i'm coming home , why dont'cha , stay up
as soon as i touched town , i make sure you high , you never come down , come down , baby

hit your skype but you signed off , hit my face time when you time off , knowin that we both get our grind on , knowin that we gotta stay focused , on that red i stay hopin , i'm back to the woods on the first thing smokin'
i got time , if you got time
when you make me yours , i'll made you mine
the cali sevice base , we fine , the cali service base , we shine
so when you so far , so gone , you're so far away , every face time , phone call , i just call to say : i love ya , i love ya , i love ya , i love ya
