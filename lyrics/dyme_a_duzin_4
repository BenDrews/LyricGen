cloud 9...1 , 1....dyme - a - duzin
lately i've higher than i ever
been before but life is getting better
when you see me now you remember
i'm on ya tv now you remember
never got no text never got no calls
i'm ballin now she on my balls
those emotions mixed with alcohol
got you stressing , wishing you were back involved
live with it , brain dead but i'm still living
late dinners , rich women
garlic pasta got shrimps in it
been faded i'm still sippin , that white in the night time
i'm running cross your mind but i'd be lying if i said likewise
you were my only , your love did it for me , i'll never forget ya
( never forget ya.....mmm )
you left me lonely and cold as the winter
now lately your calling to say that your sorry
& how much you miss the ( memories )
but girl that was so long , ago & i'm so gone & i don't remember
too high to remember
i got , trouble matching faces to the names
burning all my cells with all these faces to the brain
swankin in the range , bracelet on the grain
freaks love the money so i wanked it till it came
and just like that the good girl in your hometown is a porn star
and she's on mine and she's off theirs she know dyme could do more for her
stay around if she know whats up , play her part and roll a blunt
don't open up , just open up
bust a nut & then smoke some more
and then that got fuzzy & they don't remember that
and i don't remember you
