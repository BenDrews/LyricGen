lay a nigga down for that chicken
spray a couple rounds for that chicken
they don't play around for that
fuck around and you get found for that
on utica utica , utica utica
them shooters a shoot at ya , them shooters a shoot at ya
they move pharmaceuticals , come through and they'll tutor ya
no matter what you into , just always stay true to ya
lifted , all of the time i'm so lifted
my mama crying i'm too gifted
why are your lines so explicit ?
you different
but i live it , all of this crime in my vision
police just raided my sisters
nephew & niece in the system
feeling like i got nobody
wonder if i got the crew
but they don't really got nobody
so what we really got to lose ?
if you scared go to mass , nigga
some masked niggas in the back and the passenger
strapped , they don't want jack but the cash from ya
but they shoot with accuracy if you acting up , blasphemy
how we praying for a come up , tinted like shades in the summer
totin' ak's with a drummer
outraged when police slay our brothers
next week on the same street spraying one another nigga
stress that's on my mind , stress my sober mind
though the hood is weak we find good & speak in these textures of the times
trace sketches for the blind , shit webster don't define
if these record execs don't check for a nigga
for the check i'm loading mine , blow the nine
lay a nigga down for that chicken
spray a couple rounds for that chicken
they don't play around for that
fuck around and you get found for that
on utica utica , utica utica
them shooters a shoot at ya , them shooters a shoot at ya
they move pharmaceuticals , come through and they'll tutor ya
no matter what you into , just always stay true to ya
i be with them drug dealers , most of them gang bang
all of us real niggas , all in the same game
they movin that product , my music that product
slang dope for that change mayne , like who is obama ?
on utica , utica ya boo is on utica
she hit my computer up , a few of them , few of us
her chickens came through with her , ran through now
i'm through with her
tell me how come all the flows be on dumb and they just getting stupider
sheesh , switching lanes bitch
vintage frames bihh
rocking shit you never seen like it's plain shit
been the man since lil donnovan , took the dollar van down to plaza fam
got'em staring like i never seen a filipino goddess in the projects , damn
i remember bullets poppin outside the apartment us duckin & dodging them
i don't remember last night , i was high off klonopins and a lot xans
chopping grams with my yardy man
popping molly in the promise land
reddish tints behind my cartier's
serving chickens out the carter , yeah
lay a nigga down for that chicken
spray a couple rounds for that chicken
they don't play around for that
fuck around and you get found for that
on utica utica , utica utica
them shooters a shoot at ya , them shooters a shoot at ya
they move pharmaceuticals , come through and they'll tutor ya
no matter what you into , just always stay true to ya
i don't know why , i feel so fried
my tears are dry , till i lose my high
feeling like i got nobody
wonder if i got the crew
they don't really got nobody
we don't really got nobody
i'm prepared to go along
because if god is with me , i'm still the winner
it's just me and god , but it's a shame
that we are so corrupt , so in love with money
that we will sell out the future of our people for a dollar bill
now what you gon' do when the dollar crashes that's on the way
for all of you who betrayed each other , kill each other for a dollar
who are bought off by a dollar , well you gon' have to find another medium of exchange
because the dollar in a little while won't be worth a dime
