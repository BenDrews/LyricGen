you already know what i'm here for
what you mean you don't got that ?
nah boy , i need all mine
yo dyme i had to man
lay a nigga down for that chicken
spray a couple rounds for that chicken ( ooh )
they don't play around for that chicken ( oh no )
run and you get found for that chicken
utica utica , st. john and utica
just get the baggies until they call you the plug
( for that chicken )
same ones in the condo , same ones on the stoop with ya
roll up the fronto , get higher than jupiter
twelve years a slave and then you blow up like you lupita
now that you ballinâ€™ you see that they all wanna hoop with ya
just me and my warriors , all of my day ones are suited up
my klay one will shoot at ya , my draymond is brutal bruh
for that iguodala , they make nigg*s holla
take chains off your neck , they will pop nigg*'s collar
just dig in your wallets or handle your problems
young nigg*s wildin'
for that ticket , draw that blick in , door got kicked in
all that flickin' , all that trickin' , you the victim , for that chicken
if you scared go to mass , nigg*
some masked nigg*s in the back and the passenger
strapped , they don't want jack but the cash from ya
but they shoot with accuracy if you acting up
blasphemy , how we praying for a come up
tinted like shades in the summer
totin' ak's with a drummer
outraged when police slay our brothers
next week on the same street , spraying with another nigg*
stress that's on my mind , stress my sober mind
though the hood is weak , we find good and speak in these textures of the times
trace sketches for the blind , shit webster don't define
if these record execs don't check for a nigga
for the check i'm loading mine , blow the nine
i be with them drug dealers , most of them gang bang
all of us real niggas , all in the same game
they movin that product , my music that product
slang dope for that change mayne , like who is obama ?
on utica , utica your boo is on utica
she hit my computer up , a few of them , few of us
her chickens came through with her , ran through now
i'm through with her
tell me how come all the flows be on dumb and they just getting stupider
sheesh , switching lanes bih
vintage frames bih
rocking shit you never seen like it's plain shit
been the man since lil' donovan , took the dollar van down to plaza fam
got 'em staring like i never seen a filipino goddess in the projects , damn
i remember bullets poppin outside the apartment us duckin' and dodging them
i don't remember last night , i was high off klonopins and a lot 'xans
chopping grams with my yardie mans
popping mollies in the promised land
reddish tints behind my cartier's
serving chickens out the carter , yeah
i don't know why , i feel so fried
my tears are dry , till i lose my high
feeling like i got nobody
wonder if i got the crew
they don't really got nobody
we don't really got nobody
