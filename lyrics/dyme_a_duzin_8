they gave me the basics , i ripped the paper
hey , who made you , the boss of me ?
i won't do what you say , i got no limitations
my imagination's , my reality
baby i just wanna wake up free , wake up free
wake up free , wake up free , wake up free , wake up free
wake up free , wake up free
nah mama i don't care what the kids think
always kept it a hundred and i did me
forget it all , and define life simply
my own world , my own space , i go away
where i don't gotta hear mom screaming , nah i don't gotta see pop leaving
where i ain't gotta deal with lame teachers , talking down on me for the same reasons
mister , mister don't you tell me what to do
you might be bigger , bigger , but i got aspirations too
and when i open my open my eyes
i hope i'm free just like i was last night
free from all he lies and deceit
all the broken promises they given to me
real worlds taking on my energy
put my life on mutual , and been asleep
a yo i swear , these critics can't tell me nothing
neither can the label suits with their fake love , flippers
they ask why i tell them i don't follow standards
and i smile for the camera , hit em' with the ye shrug
hey , hey , mister , mister , don't you tell me what to do
cause when i'm on , ya'll gone , wanna hop up on it too
and when the sun gone rise , i bet i'll still be where i was last night
i wanna go ( ! )
it's just where i wanna be
gone from all a these demons haunting me
where the sun arise in my eyes
the smile from the wonderful joy of see
now won't you come away with me , no matter what they say just be
now won't you come away with me , no matter what they say i'm me
