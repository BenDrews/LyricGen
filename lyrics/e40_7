jumping off the front porch with a new approach
don't approach me with the bullshit
i remote to a location where the broom sit
here i go street sweeper monday to friday , if not go
we can catch a fade , catch a fade , catch a fade
catch a fade , catch a fade , catch a fade , catch a fade
pulling up and hopping out
shell , catch it poppin out
and i ain't never been a tom or jerry
pussy or a rat , pussy on my nutsack
carry plenty kenny tats give me that give me plenty feddi
federales on my back , pack them in the cemetery
send a scary hit out on your messenger
im ignorant to wrestle a gorilla in the center of a acura intergera
i'm pissed off , so i piss off rooftops
drinking through a straw , fuck a rental cop
i'm hot i'm napalm when the beat slap like eight palms
and i wear eight charms , every airport alarm
go off till they tackle me , what i do wrong ?
nigga it ain't bout the chain , nigga you the fucking bomb
bomb on a bitch nigga then his bitch later
put the tips on the bitch , nigga you a fucking waiter
i don't even want a favor i just want a fair one
and it's like that till the sheriffs come
look , problems we solve them , bout that action
one less sucker nigga , that's subtraction
his boss is , factors on the team
real niggas , no actors on the team
not you , who droop , he a good dude
put him in a bad mood , turn you into goon food
i'm in the party , feeling like me
s - i - c - k , with tde
your bitch want sex and my ear like wax
and this landy got her ready to get it hit from the back
she shows up chump , salute give daps
get your face flat , you don't want that
get your nose tapped , you don't want that
get your life fucked up all over a batch
get cropped , get chopped , all over your head like a barber shop
have it out in the parking lot
stay turned , super charged up , stoned
ghetto pass never revoked
mouthpiece faster than a speedboat
keep it one hundred like a c - note , p - coat
po - po tryna decode lingo
not drunk but i'm finna be hella twisted
lifted like a toilet seat , grown ass kid
my bitch always telling me , i ain't shit
she hate me , but she love my dick
trapper factor macker having money like a rapper
bumping local talent pulling up with the blabber
patna wanna challenge cause my pockets hella fatter
but he gone be unlucky like walking under a ladder
put hands on a man , fuck unity
there's nothing between us , but space and opportunity
never been a sucker , never been a lame
stay in your lane you can't see me like a stealth plane
