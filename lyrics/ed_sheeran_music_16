now i don't wanna hate you
just wish you'd never gone for the man
and waited two weeks at least
before you let him take you
i stayed true , i kind of knew
you liked the dude from private school
he's waiting for the time to move
i knew he had his eyes on you
he's not the right guy for you
don't hate me 'cause i write the truth
no , i would never lie to you
but it was never fine to lose you
and what a way to find out
it never came from my mouth
you never changed your mind
but you were just afraid to mind out
i won't be changing the subject , i love it
i'll make your little secret public
it's nothing , i'm just disgusted with the skeletons
you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
trapped and i'm lacking sleep
fact is you're mad at me
because i backtrack so casually
you're practically my family
if we married then i'll guess you'd have to be
but tragically our love just lost the will to live
but would i kill to give it one more shot ?
i think not
i don't love you baby
i don't need you baby
i don't want you no
anymore
i don't love you baby
i don't need you baby
i don't wanna love you no
anymore
recently i tend to zone out
up in my headphones to holocene
you promised your body but i'm away so much
i stay more celibate than in a monastery
i'm not cut out for life on the road
'cause i didn't know i'd miss you this much
and at the time we'd just go , so sue me
i guess i'm not the man that you need
ever since you went to uni
i've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
full of less cash and i guess that could get bad
but when i broke the industry
that's when i broke your heart
i was supposed to chart and celebrate
but good things are over fast
i know it's hard to deal with and see this
i tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
then i turn the music off
and all i'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces , jesus
i never really want to believe this
got advice from my dad and he
told me that family is all i'll ever have and need
i guess i'm unaware of it
success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with
i don't love you baby
i don't need you baby
i don't want you no
anymore
i don't love you baby
i don't need you baby
i don't wanna love you no
anymore
and since you left , i've given up my days off
it's what i need to stay strong
i know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
i feel like writing a book , i guess i lied in the hook
'cause i still love you and i need you by my side if i could
the irony is if my career and music didn't exist
in 6 years , yeah , you'd probably be my wife with a kid
i'm frightened to think if i depend on cider and drink
and lighting a spliff i fall into a spiral and it's
just hiding my misguiding thoughts that i'm trying to kill
and i'd be writing my will before i'm 27 , i'll die from a thrill
go down in history as just a wasted talent
it's only therapy , my thoughts just get ahead of me
eventually i'll be fine i know that it was never meant to be
either way i guess i'm not prepared , but i'll say this
take my apology , i'm sorry for the honesty
but i had to get this off my chest
i don't love you baby
i don't need you baby
i don't want you no
anymore
i don't love you baby
i don't need you baby
i don't wanna love you no
anymore
