i feel like i had plastic surgery , cause today i looked in the mirror an' realised i'm faced with neglection
feeling like i'm in the belly of the beast , trying to get out , i don't even think it knows that it's pregnant
stuck in the dream of deception , similar to a scene from inception
looking at reviews from the last show baffled , thinking " how come i didn't even get a mention ? "
shocking. i think somebody put too many plugs in my extension
i signed to music for twenty - three years , now i'm wondering why it doesn't want an extension
i'm being ignored , even the crowds just staring , i see the tension
now i'm on the stage feeling like a mobile phone in the basement , cause i got no reception
ah , no bars , get it ?
now i'm choking , no bars , get it ?
it turned cloudy , no stars , get it ?
i hit the ground so hard , headache
ah , it's mad
i should be proud right now but i'm sad
cause me and the world are out of touch , like the relationship between me and my dad
( ed sheeran )
i'm out of touch , in a cold december
now
keep me warm
i'm out of sight
with all these things i've done
don't hold me down
it's more than i can take
now
i'm out of sight
in a cold december

uh , my mum walks past me. my brother prays asking why i have left them ?
i didn't know i broke up with my girlfriend 'til i saw her with someone else in beckton
( wow )
i text her , " you dissed it " . she don't reply like it's none of my business
my mind goes round in circles , it keeps on rolling , rolling more than limp bizkit
why'd you do me so wicked ? something must've happened , how did i miss this ?
love turns to pain , expressed with rage. i want justice but i got no witness ( help )
now i'm powerless. probably why i'm fascinated with misfits
i guess i'm single , not happy , cause my heart doesn't feel like triplets
ah , free , nobody understands but me
i don't think i got no - one but myself , so when i'm broke i still say " i got p "
ah , it's mad. i should be proud right now but i'm sad
cause me and the world are out of touch , like the relationship between me and my dad

i'm out of touch , in a cold december

keep me warm

so many thoughts battle me , got me holding my head in agony
trying to put the pieces together and figure out if this nightmare is really reality
so many turning their back on me
( wait )
it's slowly coming back to me
all i can see is the word tragedy , but i didn't think there was a fatality
uh , damn , i think i know why i don't see my dad
i think i know why my mum walks past
and why me and my girlfriend don't chat
see , all this time i thought i was mad
i know why i'm not proud and why i'm sad
i'm out of sight and touch , cause back in march i don't think i survived that crash
( ed sheeran )
i'm out of touch , in a cold december
now
keep me warm
i'm out of sight
with all these things i've done
don't hold me down
it's more than i can take
now
i'm out of sight
in a cold december
cold december ( repeat till fade )
