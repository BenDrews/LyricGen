hi , my name is jme
there was a time when radio played me
cause my music came from my heart
it was real to me , but now it's a par
i'm here struggling , keeping it real
while the rest of them are hustling , seeking a deal
sometimes i sit back and think
" jme just do one tune , make a couple gs and chill "
the reason i started making music is the exact same
reason that i'll never do it , i swear
i didn't go through all of that for this
i'll give that a miss , that's just how it is
i'm fair , straight , who can tell me different ?
look at me , determined , man on a mission
my music is me , and i am my music
so like it or lump it , i'mma do this
i never had a playlist in my heart
now i need an a list just to chart
but i've been famous from the start
how am i gonna make my mark ?
are you gonna play me though ?
this song was never meant for the radio
( i get it in forget a radio spin , i'm just doing my thing
and i don't have time for a playlist )
how much will you pay me though
if this song's not a hit on the radio ?
oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh
thank god for night clubs and the raves
cause i don't think they like us on the airwaves
unless we water it down
but cordial music is boring me now
i swear , i guess it matters what your goal is
or in this music scene , what your role is
i'm still trying here , cause i'm a pioneer
i use my mouth less than i use my eyes and ears
see i'm just telling you the truth
can't shoot the messenger , bulletproof booth
you won't hear me on the radio
but go to the rave , and the crowd , they're raising roof
why is that ? what's going on there ?
to tell you the truth , i don't really care
i am my music , my music is me
like it or not , this is how it's gonna be
i never had a playlist in my heart
now i need an a list just to chart
but i've been famous from the start
how am i gonna make my mark ?
are you gonna play me though ?

if this song's not a hit on the radio ?
oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh
i feel it on the airwave , spinning on the dial
bleeding through the speakers , written by the pile
so won't you hear me out ?
never feel it from the bass line , feel it in the club
maybe i could take time singing for the dub
so won't you hear me out ?
