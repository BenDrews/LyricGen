now i'm in town , break it down
thinking of making a new sound
playing a different show every night
in front of a new crowd
that's you know , ciao
seems that life is great now
see me loose focus as i sing to you loud
i can't , no i won't hush
i'll say the words that make you blush
i'm gonna sing this now
see , i'm true
my songs are where my heart is
i'm like glue
i stick to other artists
i'm not you
no , that would be disastrous
let me sing and do my thing
and move to greener pastures
see , i'm real , i do it all , it's all me
i'm not fake , don't ever call me lazy
i won't stay put
give me the chance to be free
suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
hey
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you , at all
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you , at all
you need me , man , i don't need you
i sing , i write my own tunes
and i write my own verse , hell
don't need another wordsmith
to make my tune sell
call yourself a singer writer
you're just bluffing
name's on the credits
and you didn't write nothing
i sing fast , i know that all my shit's cool
i will blast and i didn't go to brit school
i came fast with the way i act right
i can't last if i'm smocking on a crack pipe
and i won't be a product of my genre
my mind will always be stronger than my songs are
never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
always read the stories that you hear on wikipedia
and musically i'm demonstrating
when i perform live feels like i am meditating
times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
young singer/writer like a gabriella cilmi
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you , at all
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you , at all
you need me , man , i don't need you
all i want in this cold world is to make music and use it
not to abuse it and get affected
infected with the who's who of music
who did it , who is it , who's in it
oh , what the hell does it matter ?
chitter chatter , don't matter
yidder yidder yidder yadder
don't matter to me
all i want is a bit of dignity to battle this industry freely
to be me in this seedy needy word
can you hear me ? hey
so i keep singing out
when i first started this rapping shit
i felt pressure from haters
became invaded with sadists
and just developed a hater radar
i'm made for the stars , kept my grime in the dark
and then appeared with a remedy
kicking rhymes with a melody
hennesey shots , and all these fools on the block
who said you've got to be a gangster now
to raise to the top ?
i'm just a casual , usual , everyday type of guy
with my head on the sky
ed sheeran , urban angel
coming ready to die
so see the signs
stand to the side
open your eyes
take a look and realize
the resurrection's arrived
and as the mist clears i arise
from my tomb in the skies
all alone , alonestar
urban angel rising from the ashes
surprising all haters guiding and moving now steady
you can find me in the club
bottle full of bub
mommy i got the ecstasy and they're taking drugs
and they're having sex and they're making love
come give me a hug , fell it getting rough
you can find me in the club , club
bottle full of bubbly
mommy i got the ecstasy and they're taking drugs
and they're having sex and they're making love
come give me a hug , fell it getting rough
cause you need me , man i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
my eyes are red , i've been burning , i've been burning
my eyes are red , i've been burning , i've been burning
my eyes are red , i've been burning
i've been burning on a spliff of your high - grade
my eyes are red , i've been burning
i've been burning burning burning
now , where i come burning weed it is a habit
a big fat bag of high - grade weed you know i got to have it
cause if i don't have it in my pocket i'm going to panic
cause like i say where i come from weed smoking is a habit
yeah do da burn up the place up in the hood
one of the things that i've inherited
like a ghetto man you should
one of the things is smoking weed
yes it makes me feel good
but high - grade sensamilla , yes it makes me feel
mommy , yes i'm gonna table sensamilla is a drug
and if i start to smoke i'm gonna turn into a thug
where i come from all that talking
it could only get you mugged
where i come from burning weed
it is a blessing from above
where i come from , yes we burn it
when we listen rob a dove
where i come from , yes we burn it
after we dash to make love
where i come from , yes we burn it
when the sun does shine
i blaze high - grade weed all the time
now , my eyes are red
cause you need me man , i don't need you
you need me man , my eyes are red
cause you need me man , i don't need you
you need me man , my eyes are red
cause you need me man , i don't need you
you need me man , my eyes are red
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
woah
woah
woah
woah
woah
woah
yeah
cause with the lyrics i'll be aiming it right
i won't stop till my name's in lights
at stadium heights , with damien rice
on red carpets , now i'm on arabien nights
because i'm young i know my brother's gonna give me advice
long nighter , sort height , and i'm going hyper
never be anything but a singer/songwriter
yeah , the game's over , but now i'm on a new level
watch how i step on the track , without a loop pedal
people think that i'm bound to blow up
i've done around about a thousand shows , but
i haven't got a house , plus i live on the couch
so , you believe the lyrics when i'm singing them out
from day one i've been prepared
with vo5 wax for my ginger hair
so now i'm back to the sofa
giving a doze of what the future holds -
rucksack for the old clothes
i rap with the cold flows
i'm back with the old jokes
in fact you don't know
on tracks i throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
if you can't keep up you'll get none , you're celibate
man , flows developing
skin lacks the melanin
give me a shot of adrenaline and i get it in
i do it for the hell of it
cause ever since i hit the mainstream with the a team
i seem to sell a bit
i took what held me back with the women
and then i packaged the image
put in some content
and then i throw it back as a gimmick
the fact is this
i'll end up dating actresses
wake up on dirty mattresses
i think i need to practice this
but i make shit happen , call me a laxative
world's on my shoulders
i don't even know what atlas is
hard part's sharp like a cactus is
i'm back to rapping back to back
cause i've been practicing
i'm back to sing this
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you , at all
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you , at all
you need me , man , i don't need you
i'll keep my last name forever
keep this genre pretty basic
gonna be braking into other people's tune
when i chase it
and replace it with an elephant in the room with a facelift
into another rapper's shoes , using new laces
i'm selling cd's from my rucksack
aiming for the papers
selling cd's from my rucksack
aiming for the majors
nationwide tour with just jack
still had to get the bus back
clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
i hit back when the pen hurts me
i'm still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee
i'm still the same as a year ago
but , more people hear me , though
according to the myspace and youtube videos
i'm always doing shows , if i'm not i'm in the studio
truly broke , never growing up , call me ruffio
melody music maker
reading all the papers
they say i'm up and coming
like i'm fucking in an elevator
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you , at all
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you
you need me , man , i don't need you , at all
you need me , man , i don't need you
