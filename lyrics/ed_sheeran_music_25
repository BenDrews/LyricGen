the thoughts i have could be clear ones , they can seem vivid
the goals i reach are not near ones , the further the limit
i block her out so when i'm looking though my mind she ain't in it
can i be free for a minute ? can i be me for a minute ?
the thoughts i have can be dark ones , even be smart ones
i know i'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
tell you what i think , i will until i depart mum
it's you that i live for , i'm the first and the last one to love you lots
what's better than thinking about the ones you love ?
nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love
i feel the same when i'm on the floor , see the sun above
unconditional like bills payed when i've run 'em up
no one here to help you pay now you're gonna moan
no one here to save the day now you're all alone
wish i was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
fact is , i wasn't so i'm coming from a quarter zone
and when the sun falls down i'll be up again , and never close my eyes
and if the dawn might break i'll see nothing when , nothing when
my thoughts are only you , and my mind is over you
my thoughts are over you , and these words are all for you now , for you
i wanna see you happy , i wanna see you smile
cause you've been trespassing and you won't leave my mind
now i've been thinking about this , you told me say " yes nan "
i'm 31 now , i'm still saying " yes nan "
you had to replace my mum , dad , two parents in one
i know you're proud staring at your grandson , i found a job i like
got the flat , the cars to buy got the quad i like
and cause of you and kylie it's in every single song i write
had a golden life , wanted people to honour mine
tell 'em while i'm here cause one day i'm gonna die
and when i'm gone i want my music to play
and when my people listen to this track it's gonna make 'em wanna cry
i ain't gonna lie , i think about the scene i made
i say the game's better , it's a must now i've gotta fly
my talents gonna shine real shortly , fam i know it
i work round the clock i don't stop at night
