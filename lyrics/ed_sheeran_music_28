now i'm in town , break it down , thinking of making a new sound
playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
that’s you now , ciao , seems that life is great now
see me lose focus as i sing to you loud
i can’t , no , i won’t hush
i’ll say the words that make you blush
i’m gonna sing this now
see , i’m true , my songs are where my heart is
i'm like glue i stick to other artists
i'm not you , now that would be disastrous
let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
see , i’m real , i do it all , it’s all me
i’m not fake , don’t ever call me lazy
i won’t stay put , give me the chance to be free
suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'cause you need me , man , i don’t need you
you need me , man , i don’t need you
you need me , man , i don’t need you at all
you need me , man , i don’t need you
you need me , man , i don’t need you
you need me , man , i don’t need you
you need me , man , i don’t need you at all
you need me
i sing and write my own tune and i write my own verse hell
don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
call yourself a singer - writer , you’re just bluffing
name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
i sing , fast , i know that all my shit's cool
i will blast and i didn't go to brit school
i came fast with the way i act , right
i can’t last , if i’m smoking on a crack pipe
and i won’t be a product of my genre
my mind will always be stronger than my songs are
never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
always read the stories that you hear in wikipedia
and musically i’m demonstrating
when i perform live , feels like i am meditating
times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
a young singer writer like a gabriella cilmi
'cause you need me , man , i don’t need you
you need me , man , i don’t need you
you need me , man , i don’t need you at all
you need me , man , i don’t need you
you need me , man , i don’t need you
you need me , man , i don’t need you
you need me , man , i don’t need you at all
you need me , man
and all i want in this cold world is to make music and use it
not to abuse it and get affected , infected with the who's who of music
who did it , who is it , who's in it or what the hell does it matter ?
chitter chatter , don't matter what a yidder , yidder , yadder , it don't matter to me
all i want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
to be me in this seedy , needy world , can you hear me ?
hey , so i keep singing that
when i first started this rapping shit i felt pressure from haters
became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
and made for the stars , kept my grind in the dark
and then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
hennessey shots and... all these fools on the block
who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise the top ?
just a normal , casual , usual , everyday type of guy
with my head in the sky , ed sheeran , urban angel coming ready to die
so see the signs , stand to the side
open your eyes and take a look and realise
the resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
i arise from my tomb in disguise , all alone , a lone star
urban angel rising from the ashes , surprising all haters
guiding , now moving steady when we say
ayy , ayy , we bring the stars out
we bring the women and the cars and the cards out
let's have a toast of celebration , get a glass out
and we can do this until we pass out , pass out
yeah , we bring the stars out
we bring the women and the cars and the cards out
let's have a toast of celebration , get a glass out
and we can do this until we pass out
'cause you need me , man , i don’t need you
you need me , man , i don’t need you
you need me , man
my eyes are red , i've been burning
i've been burning
my eyes are red , i've been burning
i've been burning
my eyes are red i've been burning
i've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
my eyes are red i've been burning
i've been burning , burning , burning
now where i come from burning weed it is a habit
a big fat bag of high grade weed , you know i got to have it
'cause if i don't have it in my pocket i'm going to panic
'cause like i said where i come from weed smoking is a habit
yup , we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
one of them things i have inherited like a ghetto man should
one of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
burning high grade sensimilla , yes it makes me feel
but me is a man , ah , talk about sensimilla is a drug
and if i start to smoke it i'ma - nna turn into a thug
where i come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
where i come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
where i come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
where i come from yes we bun after we just - a make a love
where i come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
i blaze high grade weed all the time
now my eyes are red
'cause you need me , i don't need you
you need me man , my eyes are red
you need me man , i don't need you
you need me man , my eyes are red
and you need me , i don't need you
you need me man , my eyes are red
you need me man , i don't need you
you need me man
'cause with the lyrics i'll be aiming it right
i won't stop until my name's in lights
at stadium heights , with damian rice
on red carpets , now i'm on arabian nights
because i'm young , i know my brothers gonna give me advice
long nighter , short height and i gone hyper
never be anything but a singer - songwriter , yeah
the game's over but now i'm on a new level
watch how i step on the track without a loop pedal
people think that i'm bound to blow up
i've done around about a thousand shows but
i haven't got a house plus i live on a couch
so you believe the lyrics when i'm singing them out
wow , from day one i've been prepared
with v05 wax for my ginger hair
now i'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
what the future holds cause it's another day
plus
i'll keep my last name forever , keep this genre pretty basic
and i'll be breaking into other people's tunes when i chase it
and replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
i'm selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the majors
nationwide tour with just jack , still had to get the bus back
clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
i hit back , when the pen hurts me
i'm still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee
i'm still the same as a year ago , but more people hear me though
according to the myspace and youtube videos
i'm always doing shows if i'm not i'm in the studio
truly broke , never growing up , call me rufio
melody music maker , reading all the papers
they say i'm up and coming like i'm fucking in an elevator
