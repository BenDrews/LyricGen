now it seems i’ve been young , dug my hole in the ground
to me there’s only up , there ain’t no point in looking down
however hard i try , i only get weaker
seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold
what you gotta do is never get yourself down
bastards do that for you , get you deeper in the ground
keep out of trouble , ain’t no trouble being pure
seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now
move on , forget it
now move on , forget it
when i first started this rapping shit i felt pressure from haters
became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
and made for the stars , kept my grind in the dark
and then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
hennesey shots and glocks , all these fools on the block
who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top ?
i'm just a normal , casual , usual , everyday type of guy
with my head in the sky
ed sheeran , urban angel coming ready to die
so see the signs , stand to the side
open your eyes and take a look and realise
the resurrection's arrived
and as the mist clears , homie i arise
from my tomb in disguise
i'm all alone , alonestar
urban angel rising from the ashes
surprising all haters , guiding , advising them all to steady move
now back up
move on , forget it
now move on , forget it
all i want in this cold world is to make music and use it
not to abuse it and get affected , infected with the who's who of music
who did it , who is it , who's in it , who…what the fuck does it matter ?
chitter chatter , don't matter , yidder , yidder , yadder
it don't matter to me
all i want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
to be me in this seedy , needy world , can you hear me ?
yeah , yeah , can you hear me ?
keep out of trouble , ain’t no trouble being pure
seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now
move on , forget it
now move on , forget it
