well get up , up on the dancefloor tonight
i've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
making me feel like the beat and the bassline
are in my blood , both hands up on her waistline
get on up , baby , dance to the rhythm of the music
don't care what the dj chooses
get lost in the rhythm of me
place don't close until we wanna leave it
and you and i , we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
we're going , somewhere where the sun is shining bright
just close your eyes
and let's pretend we're dancing in the street
in barcelona
barcelona
barcelona
barcelona
well , get up , up on the dancefloor , move , it's a saturday night
i fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
reflected in your beautiful eyes
i guess that is destiny doing it right
and dance like they do in the mediterranean
spin you around me again and again , and
you're like something that god has sent me
i want you , baby , solamente
and you and i , we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
we're going , somewhere where the sun is shining bright
just close your eyes
and let's pretend we're dancing in the street
in barcelona
barcelona

oh , barcelona
so let's pretend we're dancing in the street
in barcelona
las ramblas , i'll meet you
we'll dance around la sagrada familia ( barcelona )
drinking sangría
mi niña , te amo mi cariño ( barcelona )

sí tú , te adoro , señorita ( barcelona )
