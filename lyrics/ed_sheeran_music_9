right now it's the millitant spot with fizzer and dot
we've got a villainous plot to make billions watch
bringing the hot flows skipping across
delivering some of the illest bars , killing them off
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh , yeah we're doing the damn thing
man think we need them but onna that thing
nah i'm back in this raptures , double my adlibs
got them all banging the anthems having a madness
for me the music's the thorn in my vein
calling my name , yeah , we're lord of the raves
i swear down i got them all talking my name
been working all year it's the ultimate gain
uh , look i don't need you making us angry , we were so peaceful
you don't really wanna see us get so lethal , any foe to approach
will be ghosted and don't be fooled , yes , people
you need me man i don't need you
you need me man i don't need you
you need me man i don't need you at all
x2
you need me
yeah , yeah y'all messed up everybody's hyped
even a blind man can see the devil in my eyes
many were the times that he saw me stepping on the mic
setting it alight , come up with the energy and vibe
feel like i'm back from a coma , stronger than ever
songs are forever so i'm living longer than ever
any genre , whatever , i'll be setting off a bomb
cause my longevity's just too long for a measure
well i'm setting off better , i'm taking over faster
showering down , you better put your umbrella on
yeah i'm stepping up a level , got my foot on the pedal
they had to resist because they need a stage to perform
case and a cord , you won't see me pace through the door
thinking i'm gonna be rich so i'm chasing the thought
as if i went crazy in a whip crashing the ride
double " p " when we enter that's passion and pride
they ain't gotta life cause they let that battery die
i'm a shooting star that ain't catching your eye
an assassin with lines and immaculate rhymes
they all say they're the truth but it's actually lies
so we hit them with a punch like a cassidy line
yeah i tried to relax but you can feel the anger inside
raging like i stand on the right , yeah my stamina is high
yeah i'm living like i stand with the mayans
so think twice cause our plans are defiant
it's blatant you need me , who's this face on the tv ?
come on , we're taking it easy
got kids in the school exchanging the cd
love hearing the bars , impatient to cheer me
