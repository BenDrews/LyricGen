home is wherever i'm with you

i follow you into the park , through the jungle through the dark
girl i've never loved one like you
moats and boats and waterfalls , alleyways and payphone calls
i been everywhere with you ( that's true )
laugh until we think we'll die , barefoot on a summer night
never could be sweeter than with you
and in the streets you run afree
like it's only you and me
