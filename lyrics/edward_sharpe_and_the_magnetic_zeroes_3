i been sleepin for 40 days and
i know im sleeping cause this dream’s too amazin'
she got gold doorknobs where her eyes used to be
one turn and i learned what it really means to see
ah , it’s the magical mystery kind
ah , must be a lie
bye bye to the too good to be true kind of love
oh , i could die
oh , now i can die
i've been sleepin for 60 days and
nobody better pinch me
bitch i swear i’ll go crazy
she got jumper cable lips
she got sunset on her breath now
i inhaled just a little bit
now i got no fear of death now
ah , it’s the magical mystery kind
ah , must be a lie
bye bye to the too good to be true kind of love
oh , i could die
oh , now i can die
ohh ahh yeah yeah yeah yeah
