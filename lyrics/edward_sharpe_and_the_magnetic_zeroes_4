come dance with me
come and set you free
come dance with me
i'm a man on fire
walking through your street
with one guitar
and two dancing feet
only one desire
that's left in me
i want the whole damn world
to come dance with me
( ohhhhhhhh. come dance with me )
over murder and pain
come and set you free
over heartache and shame
i wanna see our bodies burning like the old big sun
i wanna know what we've been learning and learning from
everybody want safety ( safety love )
everybody want comfort ( comfort love )
everybody want certain ( certain love )
everybody but me
i’m a man on fire
walking down your street
with one guitar
and two dancing feet
only one desire
that’s left in me
i want the whole damn world
to come and dance with me
( bah bah bah bah bah... )
yay , yay. come dance with me
over heartache and rage
come set us free
over panic and strange
i wanna see our bodies burning like the old big sun
i wanna know what we've been learning and learning from
everybody want romance ( romance love )
everybody want safety ( safety love )
everybody want comfort ( comfort love )
everybody but me
i’m a man on fire ( he’s a man on fire )
walking down your street ( walking down your street )
with one guitar ( with one guitar )
and two dancing feet ( two dancing feet )
only one desire ( one desire )
that’s still in me ( that’s left in me )
i want the whole damn world ( i want the whole damn world )
to come and dance with me ( come and dance with me yeahhhhh… )
