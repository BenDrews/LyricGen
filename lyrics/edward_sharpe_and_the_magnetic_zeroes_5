if i were free
i would run into battles with flowers and hugs
and bow at the boots of our well - oiled thugs
yes , if i were free
if it were me
i would yell out " i love you ! " to all i passed
i would disrobe and disco and rip off my mask
yes , if i were free i'd be the 'u' that crossed the 'i' to simply 'b'
minding our reflections at the bottom of the sea
what did you see ?
i saw that you and i forever have been free
the light became too heavy and i fell into a dream
what did you dream ?
i dreamed a wind that would sweep
every castle made of sand
out across the old far holy land
oh , if this were free
if this were free
we'd be free of the terror of the graves
and fear masquerading as the brave
oh , if this were free
i woke upon a pig of red , white and blue
the circus got too heavy so we fell into the zoo
what did you feel ?
i felt the fear that every queer does in his head
first thing to starting over , i made sure i was dead
what did you dream ?
swimming with ancients , laughing , tired of getting lost
we took our left , remember , when we leaned upon the cross
what did you see ?
i saw that you and i forever have been free
the light became too heavy and we fell into a dream
