i’ve seen better days , dripping down your face
we don’t have to talk , let’s dance
for all the times you felt alone , dreaming better
i see better , better days
too dumb to say goodbye that's some cliché shit , make me wanna cry
just know that every time i look in your eye , i see better , i see better , better days
try to remember , that you can’t forget
down with history , up with your head
for sweet tomorrow , she never fell from grace
we might still know sorrow but we got better days
i seen better ways , some won’t believe
but i don’t need much more than faith
for all the times you felt alone
dreaming better , dreaming better , better ways
too dumb to say goodbye , now that’s some give up shit , make me wanna cry
just know that every time i look in your eye , i see better , i see better , better days
better days
guess who's back in town
