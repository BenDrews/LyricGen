when did you decide to take away all her pride now
who gave you the right to say how high she can fly now
she's ready to fly now
she's ready to fly now
high , she's getting high
somehow you think someone died and made you king
you know boys they love to tear off butterfly wings
she's getting high now
she's ready to fly now
high , yeah she's getting high
high , you know she's ready to fly
so kiss her goodbye now
you drive , unwind , and slide into the zone in your mind
babe , baby blue you're caught behind the things that you do
she's getting high
