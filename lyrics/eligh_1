lets get busy , yeah who's with me
all these lights and they oh so pretty
just one night to live like kids
see i'm on fire and this my city
lets get busy , come on who's with me
all these lights and they oh so pretty
just one night to live like kids
see i'm on fire and this my city
big city of dreams i'm cruisin'
we're playin' the game and not loosin'
been bangin' the name
and ain't changin' a thang
except won't accept all the rules in it
i'm a fool , may bull , no mule in it
hella cool , sharp tools on full limits
dope record go call guinness
this moment , let's own it
yeah we all in it !
one foot in the government
one foot in the soul
mix up all the rubbish then
turn that grit to gold
lets get busy , yeah who's with me
all these lights and they oh so pretty
just one night to live like kids
see i'm on fire and this my city
lets get busy , come on who's with me
all these lights and they oh so pretty
just one night to live like kids
see i'm on fire and this my city
you see the night is on the mind
making music is on the table
i'm able to do the limbo
get low and get on the maybelline makeup girlies are dancing..
not on the pick up , not looking for no romancing
the kids in the hall , we ballin
we callin the spirits of the fallen angels
hands to the sky , let them know that we know that they there
sharing the rhythm given by god to the people
equal or not , or sought out by kids that get caught in the darkness
one foot in the government
one foot in the soul
mix up all the rubbish then
turn that grit to gold
