always a fire in her eyes
the mere sight of her silhouette
most are frightened
yet i sat and lit a cigarette
lost in excitement
she breathed life into my cold strife
plus got fight like 300 without a bowled strike
like lightning
could melt iron mike tyson
so fly
she rules the sky without a pilot's license
no man in orbit's safe
not even viking's in the nordic states
she like light sun in the morning makes
not son of the morning
more like daughter of dawn
the queen of the summer
none hotter has spawned
she's killin' the game
when iâ€™m feelin' her flame
it kills stress so the villain remains
she's always had it , blue flame magic inside her basket
the ability to move through pain like you move through traffic
born that way , like a brick house
tough and hard to interpret , kept her feelings un - detected
reflective on the surface
eartha kitt with the spit , she could get anything with the wit
she gamed up , she came up off the cats that want to fuck
on they back they lay , ate like a parfait , no bar code
she's off the grid , orphan to the streets
morphing enemies into puzzle pieces , put them in they place
inner space filled with pills dissolving in a hennessy lake
of sadness , a woman's madness , on the brink of a break down
she finds surrender , and though that may sound like giving in
she found her way back to self , and from the days that
she pimped those hoes across the race track
she found some peace in knowing that's she's decent in the
eyes of god , and she can teach that , a reach back , to the
young girls , on the avenues , with the same flame
tattooed on their corneas
it's burning
i felt it
inferno
melted
speechless
moments
vibrations
opponents
she's so hot
and steaming
all words
are unheard
i sure got
the meaning
no wonder
just thunder
much like sun rays at noontime
or alcohol content in moonshine
scorching the area of focus
make ashes of your entire fortress
with one look
it's over
game done
a soldier
passion
desire
inside her
the fire !
