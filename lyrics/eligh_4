steve knight :
we floatin' through space and time
and i ain't comin back
we crossed the line
you know there ain't no turnin' back
my heart was blind my eyes been opened now
walkin' through this meteor town
it's like a , yea
eligh :
emotional songs breakin' bones take me home
strong enough to deal with the feelings you give me
i'm not needy , feeding it to the jealous devil inside
pride and prejudice in the menacing ghost with you on the phone
leave me alone , i'm all in my zone , i'm makin' my music
and fuck a baritone it comes to a cold
metaphor of a car brokin' down in the backyard , the stress
no need to poke at somethin' that can't be fixed
you and i don't need to be in each other's mix
each other's fixation , sexual sensation , but you a frustration
fuck this , i'm off to my space station
( inner space meteor showers... )
girl , you can ride along as a friend
but i will not pretend that we're lovers till the end
cause in like every single song that i sing
i say i'm not a perfect man way far from that land and um...
im on a desert island and i'm smilin'
_ once again , prone to get a pen
make mends through a picket fence
keeping that sickness back from complete intoxication
cause i do not think clear like most
my heartbeat drowns out thoughts all day
im sick im lost can't find my way
somethin' guide me cause my pathways strayed
and the winds blow the sand that been followin' for days , days...
now mutha fuckas need to get the fuck up out my way
because a motha fucka's heart _
droppin' any mutha fuckin panties
somewhat damaged mutha fuckin' loungin'
and they had me full of panic
but i love you always

eligh :
always get thinner
arteries clogged by love im a sinner
yet i keep bringin' that bitch in for dinner
must like pain , night train
no glitter no gold on porn sites
all night quitter , bust that out
take a seat from a shitter
throne my home im a man in america
readin' magazines sit back and stare at the t.v
i.v. in the to the vein , blank out
so i dont feel that pain
used to be pills , heroin , cocaine
now it's netflix , nicotine , caffeine
in this fucked up dream i'm a man , peter pan
growing up is a sin but i'm still gonna win
cause i come from within , that's real
now mutha fuckas need to get the fuck up out my way
because a motha fucka's _
droppin' any mutha fuckin panties
somewhat damaged mutha fuckin' loungin'
and they had me full of panic
but i love you always
