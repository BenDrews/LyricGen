trying hard to kill the crazy voice inside of me
all these little things , that the ego brings
deal with what is real instead of fuel the self - esteem
all these little things , that the ego brings
edging god out fills the acronym for the evil i face all day , always
amaze in a gaze but you can't faze me when i'm on my game
the ego , my nemesis , my chemistry , unequaled
find balance through my people
i talk it out , not so lethal when i let it out , my steeple
the open manner in which i discuss private matters
i'm seeking guidance
any shape any size and they each don't mean a thing
what you providing to me
wisdom stem cell serenities is what i seek that is my diamond
there's nothing i might need _
_ ego gets broken down
finally dust particles , articles and the silver lining
keep comin together like liquid metal from the terminator igniting
oppressing your post negative emotions driven by ego
denial and the fact that i'm a child of the universe and i'm wild
and i deserve to smile every once in awhile
and constantly thinking about my poor body imagery
then overcompensate by telling myself that
i'm finer than everyone else in the room , wow
i'll be there when the clouds are on the ground
got to find the balance in between the two and bow
to the sensei who i vow , to never lose sight _
never to fight against _ and to be proud of me and my style
trying hard to kill the crazy voice inside of me
all these little things , that the ego brings
deal with what is real instead of fuel the self - esteem
all these little things , that the ego brings
ego killer ( wandering the landscape with a bow and arrow aiming at your villa )
ego killer ( kill myself on a daily basis just to be reborn to find my true face )
ego killer..
always in conflict with that part of the brain
man if i'm the only one , then bitch i must be insane
mirror mirror on the wall , why do i pick apart my soul
find the flaws to find myself by _
that shit is getting old
wrinkles getting deeper underneath my eyes
a light sleeper stuck between a pair of thighs
got sent women giving birth to sacrifice
my ego must pay the price to live in paradise
ego killer ( wandering the landscape with a bow and arrow aiming at your villa )
ego killer ( kill myself on a daily basis just to be reborn to find my true face )
ego killer ( got to find that place of mind that reigns friendships over vanity )
