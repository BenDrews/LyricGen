it's a little blurry how the whole thing started
i don't even really know what you intended
thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
poured it down , so i poured it down
next thing that i know i'm in a hotel with you
you were talking deep like it was mad love to you
you wanted my heart but i just liked your tattoos
poured it down , so i poured it down
and now i don't understand it
you don't mess with love , you mess with the truth
and i know i shouldn't say it
but my heart don't understand
why i got you on my mind
why i got you on my mind
why i got you on my mind
why i got you on my mind
but my heart don't understand
why i got you on my mind
why i got you on my mind
why i got you on my mind
why i got you on my mind
i always hear , always hear them talking
talking 'bout a girl , 'bout a girl with my name
saying that i hurt you but i still don't get it
you didn't love me , no , not really
wait
i could have really liked you
i'll bet , i'll bet that's why i keep on thinking 'bout you
it's a shame ( shame ) , you said i was good
so i poured it down , so i poured it down
and now i don't understand it
you don't mess with love , you mess with the truth
and i know i shouldn't say it
but my heart don't understand
why i got you on my mind
why i got you on my mind
why i got you on my mind
why i got you on my mind
but my heart don't understand
why i got you on my mind
you think you know somebody
why i got you on my mind
you think you know somebody
why i got you on my mind
you think you know somebody
why i got you on my mi - i - i - i - ind
you got yourself in a dangerous zone
cause we both have the fear , fear of being alone
and i still don't understand it
you don't mess with love , you mess with the truth
and my heart don't understand it
understand it , understand it
why i got you on my mind
you think you know somebody
why i got you on my mind
you think you know somebody
why i got you on my mind
you think you know somebody
why i got you on my mind
but my heart don't understand
why i got you on my mind
you think you know somebody
why i got you on my mind
you think you know somebody
why i got you on my mind
you think you know somebody
why i got you on my mind
but my heart don't understand
