you're the light , you're the night
you're the colour of my blood
you're the cure , you're the pain
you're the only thing i wanna touch
never knew that it could mean so much , so much
you're the fear , i don't care
cause i've never been so high
follow me through the dark
let me take you past the satellites
you can see the world you brought to life , to life
so love me like you do , la - la - love me like you do
love me like you do , la - la - love me like you do
touch me like you do , ta - ta - touch me like you do
what are you waiting for ?
fading in , fading out
on the edge of paradise
every inch of your skin is a holy grail i've got to find
only you can set my heart on fire , on fire
yeah
i'll let you set the pace
cause i'm not thinking straight
my head's spinning around , i can't see clear no more
what are you waiting for ?
love me like you do , la - la - love me like you do
love me like you do , la - la - love me like you do
touch me like you do , ta - ta - touch me like you do
what are you waiting for ?

love me like you do , la - la - love me like you do
