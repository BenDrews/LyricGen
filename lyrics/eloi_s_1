the first time i saw you crawling there
you're such a mess on the floor
you were a million miles from reality
and i , i couldn't envy you more
saw you , you took another sip from that bottle
and you looked right into my soul
you had the fresh face of a black and white movie star
who's never gonna grow old
eloise , please don't fuck it up like me
take a day at a time , you'll see
everything's gold , everything , everything
there's a business man with a black leather jacket yeah
you got him paying your bills
and your mother's marrying a millionaire now
she's who gives you those pills , i know how it goes
they said you got eyes like your father but
you still ain't talked to him yet
yeah and you just love to watch the world pass by
but you're , you're too young for regret
eloise , please don't fuck it up like me
take a day at a time , you'll see
everything's gold , everything , everything
eloise , please don't fuck it up like me
take a day at a time , you'll see
everything's gold , everything , everything
i've seen the morning come up from the other side
i've been the belle of the ball , but
when the carnival's packed up and left you go
what is left of it all
and you don't have a bedtime , no !
you barely even got a bed , but
only you can teach yourself to walk
you gotta long road , long road ahead
oh eloise
eloise , please don't fuck it up like me
take a day at a time , you'll see
everything's gold
eloise , please don't fuck it up like me
take a day at a time , you'll see
everything's gold
