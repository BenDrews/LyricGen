dear eloise , i am writing to say
a number of funny things i heard today
i heard that he's left you and run off to sea
could be the best thing that's happened to me
writing a letter to make you feel better
sorry to hear that he left you that way
i could have told you , he was much older
so much older than you
you rushed in blindly , he treated you kindly
until he found out what he could get from you
you should have departed before he got started
now you've been burned just like i said you would
please read my letter closely
it's beneficial too
you must read in - between the lines
a message you will see
if you use your mind , you'll find
i want you back with me
ba ba ba ba ba , ba ba ba ba ba
ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
ba ba ba ba ba , ba ba ba ba ba
ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
writing a letter to make you feel better
sorry to hear that he left you that way
i could have told you , he was much older
so much older than you
so much older than you
so much older than you
dear eloise , i am writing to say
