woke up this afternoon , just in time for dinner
no apathy in me , so i took a shower
then i laid all on my couch with my bag of cheetos
watching soaps all day until i start craving doritos
so i went up my stairs to get the keys to my car
thought i might drive to the store but that's just too dang far
so i booted my computer as i put my pants on
then ordered some cool ranch chips from amazon
cause that's how life goes in my parent's basement
i live there so i don't have to get a job to pay rent
toss me the " l " cause i ain't afraid to hold it
it's fine with me , i'm responsibiliphobic
i eat pizza like mikey and play games like bjergsen
i'm down with just chilling and i can't stand working
they say " kid , you're smart ! the way you live is absurd ! "
i reply so sly , " i'm just a slacker. "
i'm just a mess of potential energy
waiting to bust on out and perform for all to see
but i can't get this sinking feeling out of me
i'm just a slacker and it's all i'll ever be
i'm , i'm , i'm a slacker x7
yeah
i've been lounging around doing absolutely nothing
i think i might be productive ? nah hush it , yeah
chilling on my back sir , call me the black nerd
wait , oh yeah , i'm king slacker
throwin' a fossil in the trash , rolex in the dumpster
ain't got time for wasting unless it's fun sir
would make moves to improve but then wait
oh man , that means i'd have to run sir
postponing responibilities
to the best o fmy ability
dodging work with nimble agility
sleeping in is how i find my peace and tranquility
let's just be clear , i'm not giving up , just giving in
know i need to pay attention , ritalin
but i don't wanna , instead i'll pout , scream , and shout
i'm a slacker i'll just take the easiest route , peace i'm out
i'm just a mess of potential energy
waiting to bust on out and perform for all to see
but i can't get this sinking feeling out of me
i'm just a slacker and it's all i'll ever be
i'm , i'm , i'm a slacker x7
yeah
