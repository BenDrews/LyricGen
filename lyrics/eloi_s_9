eloise , hang on in there
eloise , hang on in there
other girls are trying to get me
but it's you i love
now i can love you if you'll only let me
it's you i'll take in the park
don't give up
don't give up
eloise , hang on in there
eloise , hang on in there
now if you want your man
you got to put up a fight
if you want to keep him happy
you got to treat him right
and , don't give up
don't give up
eloise , hang on in there
eloise , hang on in there
you're the only girl in life for me
just for you alone i waited patiently
if you give up i wouldn't know what to do
eloise , my darling i'm counting on you
don't give up
don't give up
eloise , hang on in there
eloise , hang on in there
