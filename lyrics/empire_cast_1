i gave you all of me
but it still ain't enough to make you happy
i gave you everything
it still don't measure up
it feels like i walked 5 thousand miles
and didn't even come close
feels like i try to make you smile
but you don't even care , no
i'll never be big enough to pay your dues
but i keep trying
and you just keep on making me jump through hoops
what do i got to do ?
i just want you to look at me
and see that i can be worth your love
i just want you to look at me
and see that i can be
good enough , good enough
good enough
and see that i can be
good enough , good enough
good enough
i try to show you that i'm strong
why do i even bother ?
cause it's the same old damn song
and you call yourself a father
feels like i'm reaching for the stars
but heaven isn't letting me
i wish that i had longer arms
but i know that will never be never be
i'll never be big enough to pay your dues
but i keep trying
and you just keep on making me jump through hoops
what do i got to do ?
i just want you to look at me
and see that i can be worth your love
i just want you to look at me
and see that i can be
good enough , good enough
good enough
and see that i can be
good enough , good enough
good enough
look at me
i'm standing right here waiting for you , here i am
look at me
lookin' for your acceptance , do you give a damn ?
look at me
see it doesn't matter what you think , i'm still a man
look at me
open up your eyes , can't you see that i'm good enough
i just want you to look at me
and see that i can be worth your love
i just want you to look at me
and see that i can be
good enough , good enough
good enough
and see that i can be
good enough , good enough
good enough
