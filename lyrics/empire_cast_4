from the bottom i got up , to the top of the pro's
from the gutter to the shutter , trimmed out in gold
life bless my soul , god bless my mold
nothing less than the best , so the rest is old
don't wanna play chess , wanna lock and load
wanna tag some toes , wanna send you home
it ain't about the pain
tell 'em what's my name
boom , boom , boom , boom

look
from the bottom i started , so it's nothing that you can say to me
a product of where i grew up , and it's the newest slavery
people see you trying hard , like why you wanna play with me
i bring them heaters out , somebody better pray for me
cause all i know is this money , i gotta have it
these suicidal thoughts getting bad , i'm getting madder
uh , they say the good die young , i put the peddle to the medal hit the gas then i'm gone
now i'm front line at the court , and i'm 'bout to take a shot
i pull it up , cock it back , let it fly
now i'm watching for the back board
and when they say the world is yours , i just let them know
that i'm just trynna score

y'all want some , come get some
y'all want some , come get some
y'all want some , come get some
y'all want some
if you ever been through it , then i'm knowing you gotta feel it
you witnessing the struggle from the realest , what the deal is
they trynna lock me down , but they created a monster
i'm beating down your block , and nobody can't stop us
( you was over there talking all kinds of tough
while you sipping on your little bit of " pick me up "
when you say you like to play a little fistacuff
so when the whistle puffs , i'm gonna call your bluff )
words from a wise man , never let 'em see you hand
in the end , i bet they all gon' understand
you can't stop what you can't see , standing here is only me
so place your bet and gone prepare for your defeat
( i caught a new jack , it said kid guard ya check
there's a brother over there , that wanna bounce your neck
ain't you 'fraid of that , watch you fade to black )
