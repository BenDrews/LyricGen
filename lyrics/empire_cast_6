open your eyes to what you love to hate
you're up in the sky but you ain't flying straight
where do i go when i can't go home ?
cause you sold it , and you lost yourself in you are just no more
take every piece , every piece of me
whatever you need , my mind is changing
and i can't hide no , but you know where i'll be
mother
i know
i said i didn't need it , i said i wasn't built for it
but now that i can see it , damn right i really made it for this
chasing the sky , trying to fly
and now i see
just why you had to be so hard for me
you'll hear my roar then fill your legacy
here to the sky , no choice but to fly , so high , so high , so high
blood is supposed to be thicker than water is
nowadays we can't even stomach the thought of it
it's like we can't even get along , who right and who in the wrong ?
too busy pointing fingers like it's politics
i tell you shut up , you tell me be quiet , too much dysfunction
cut up like we at a riot , kicking and punching
ain't nobody here to mediate it
and you would think that we wasn't even related
why are we even throwing blows in the first place ?
we fight at cook outs , picnics and birthdays
i tried to give the benefit but in the worst case
you keep on talking smack , you end up with a hurt face
and we tried everything , it's time for plan b
if bloods and crips can reconcile , why can't we ?
i guess i'm ratchet like my mama and my poppa
i'm chasing the sky and i ain't talking 'bout the vodka , let's fly
far from a perfect man
the fights and the lies , i guess you never understand
a mother and father who wanted for you much more than
life is a slight of hand , if you hate it today
and my love for you is the one thing thatâ€™s true
going all alone , i can't even trust all the people here inside my home
and if you were my brother , then never let it get so wrong
that you turn your back on what we were
turn your back on me , on your family , no
i know
i said i didn't need it , i said i wasn't built for it
but now that i can see it , damn right i really made it for this
chasing the sky , trying to fly
and now i see
just why you had to be so hard for me
you'll hear my roar then fill your legacy
here to the sky , no choice but to fly , so high , so high , so high
