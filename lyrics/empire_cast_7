life is like a big merry go round
you're up and then down
goin' in circles , tryin' to get to where you are
everybody's been counting you out
but where are they now ?
sittin' in the same ole' place , just faces in the crowd
well , we all make mistakes
you might fall on your face
but you gotta get up
i'd rather stand tall
than live on my knees
cause i am a conqueror
and i won't accept defeat
try tellin' me no
one thing about me
is i am a conqueror
i am a conqueror
oh
got a vision that no one else sees
lot of dirty work , roll up your sleeves
remember there's a war out there , so come prepared to fight
you never know where the road will lead you
not everyone's gonna believe ya'
and even though they're wrong , don't prove 'em right
i'd rather stand tall ( tall )
than live on my knees ( can't live on my knees )
cause i am a conqueror
and i won't accept defeat
try tellin' me no ( no )
one thing about me ( one thing about me )
is i am a conqueror
i am a conqueror
oh
ooo ooo ooo ooo
ooo ooo ooo ooo
i am a conqueror
we all make mistakes
you might fall on your face
but you gotta get up ( oh )
we all make mistakes
you might fall on your face
don't ever give up
i'd rather stand tall ( whoo , ooo , ooo )
than live on my knees ( than live on my knees )
cause i am a conqueror ( i am a conqueror )
and i won't accept defeat ( and i won't accept defeat )
try tellin' me no ( try tellin' me no )
one thing about me ( said one thing about me )
is i am a conqueror ( i am a conqueror )
i am a conqueror ( yeah )
oh
ooo ooo ooo ooo
ooo ooo ooo ooo
i am a conqueror
oh , no
we all make mistakes
you might fall on your face
but i am a conqueror
