*police sirens*
streets are watching , eyes are on me
closed into me then switch up on me
days are long and nights are lonely
it's better to know it cause now i know it and
whoo
sittin' back , reminiscin'
of how i used to get down and dirty wit' ya
i pull up on a hot block and come and get ya
wit' a pistol cocked to handle all issues
but never would i thought in a million wishes
after all we stood for , you would start snitchin'
i disregarded lessons that was shared with me
cause i was taught i'm not supposed to trust any
it's hard to see the frame when you're in the picture
but now the picture's faded , bitch i'm done wit' ya
so gon' head , handle ya business
and get right , cause i'm comin' to visit
streets are watching , eyes are on me
closest to me done , switched up on me
days are long n' nights are lonely
it's better to know it , cause now i know it
you ain't nothing but a snitch , bitch
snitchin' ass bitch
snitch bitch , snitching ass bitch
and you know it , and you know it
and you know it ( and you know it )
and i know it ( i know it )
and you know i know it ( you know i know it )
aaah
blood is thicker than water the people say
i say people will say whatever you pay em' to say
and some will say whatever just to have something to say
you done said it , would you please get the hell on the way
i'll never trust another single one of y'all
cause trust is just something you just don't get involved
back stabbing bitches get you knocked - off
classified information being passed off
they doin' deals , they at the round table
pen and a pad , they making wild statements
forget your allegations and your investigations
i knew this day was coming , i'd been patiently waiting
streets are watching , eyes are on me
closest to me done , switched up on me
days are long n' nights are lonely
it's better to know it , cause now i know it
you ain't nothing but a snitch , bitch
snitchin' ass bitch
snitch bitch , snitching ass bitch
and you know it , and you know it
and you know it ( and you know it )
and i know it ( i know it )
and you know i know it ( you know i know it )
aaah
temperature in the hundreds hot as hell at this moment
everything looks suspicious coming around these corners
a man wanted , you can play around if you want
ain't no safety , ain't no holster and my hands is on it
now , i ain't going easy as you think i'm gon' go
imma lay low for a minute then i'm coming for those
that decided to cross the road and roll with the wrong folks
like playing a grand piano but tapping the wrong notes
whoo !
