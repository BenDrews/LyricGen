never had beef
if it was some hell i ain't even much know
did your main chick like my pics ?
better fix your cuffs , we don't love these
holes in the wall , got leaks in the roof by the bed
delray , b - town , lake worth , palm beach
and the raw to the muck projects
straight to the hood
bottom of the map where the state got zoe's
and i rep that f.l.a. like this , like that

oh me , oh my
oh no , what's up ?
by the time you count to 3 , i'ma disappear like ( peeuurrnn )

don't ask for the money i owe , i'm broke
i ain't got no change
i don't wanna be a member to a club for a cheap discount
i already donate gave a dollar when i came
don't ask me again when i come out

by the time you count to 3 , i'ma disappear like
oh me , oh my
oh no , what's up ?
by the time you count to 3 , i'ma disappear like

the planetcoffeebean always possessed power in which civilized people on earth would never understand
one magical creature being the mythical winged elephant was told to have special elements and knowledge that citizens alike cherished
although being extinct for years , the winged elephant with its marble skin did not have the ability to flyâ€”so we are told
but stories of one of these mythical creatures flying across the frozen lake live on for years , and hold the metaphor for doing the impossible
defying the laws of aerodynamics
and motivating a culture to achieve the unthinkable
