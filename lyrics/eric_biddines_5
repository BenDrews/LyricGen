coffee in my cup , i hope you understand
it's more like therapy , whenever in my hand
it gets no better than this cup i have of coffee
it gets no better than this cup i have of coffee
if i don't wake up in the morning to coffee
i must not have waken up at all , i'm dead in a coffin
or probably somewhere lost in , trapped in what you call a
place that every coffee drinker hate to be we all a
victim of being guilty to being addicted
it's the aroma we long for , provided we lifted
i love the feeling like the moon above the beach
the smell of wet rain on the afternoon concrete
early dew on freshly cut grass
drink it slow i take my first sip of the brew like it's my last
coffee so good you have to look back at the cup
reminds me why i love this feeling right here so much
you lolly gagging when you lucky to be living
people stressing everyday , lost family that's no longer with 'em
i talk about this coffee but it's way more deeper
it's an expression that we digging for relax a bit
get up and pour some
you could be riding on the bus or subway
with you ipod in your ear lobes , that coffee you might take
driving to your job and hope your boss took a vacation
waiting for you train to come , rely on public transportation
just seen a text sent from your ex that you was missing
checking on you like you got over the arguments and tension
some times you really want to be alone
gone come a moment in your life you're looking for this song
saying that eric was striking a chord inside my soul
ain't even know that it existed must be something that he know
well i don't know everything , but i know life
is random , and making sure that you stir your coffee right
i'm gifted in a sense to know that happiness is gold
everybody is unique , we was made a custom mould
i believe in good karma
locate the place that ease your mind and block the stressfulness with armor
you don't even know what's on my mind
but you don't need a watch to know it's time
i'm tryna fast forward or press rewind
the present is a gift , i realized
so i'm
drinking ( x7 )
and i'm
drinking ( x7 )
and i'm
drinking ( x7 )
my coffee
