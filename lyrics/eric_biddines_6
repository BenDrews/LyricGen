hand full of dreams , pocket full of hope
wallet got enough of space to fit whatever what you want
still fishing for that open moment
saving whatever i don't already have i'm eating donuts , and drinking coffee
spending money in my mind for the things ain't even bought yet , we living like we fine
me and t - green be driving through them neighborhoods
with double front doors , and balconies , jacuzzi , tubs
houses like the one the taxi dropped off will
fresh prince of bel - air where we from ain't no uncle phil background full of alcoholic kinfolk , shadetree mechanic , ged's , either job corp
the story of the average nigga out the hood
try to get it how i live don't get stuck like tires in mud
i ain't expecting for nobody here to help me , this ain't a cry for help i'm just venting , excuse my expression
i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
don't want the next generation after my family struggle tired stuck working a job with sorry ass 30 - min breaks
'bout time you warm up your food , you already late
you can't afford to pay attention even nowadays
need twenty dollars that i can borrow till friday
need twenty dollars that i can borrow till friday
need twenty dollars that i can borrow till friday
hopeless like a penny with a hole i'll say
need 20 dollars that i can borrow till friday
need 20 dollars that i can borrow till friday
need 20 dollars that i can borrow till friday
you can't afford to pay attention even nowadays
need twenty dollars that i can borrow till friday
need twenty dollars that i can borrow till friday
need twenty dollars that i can borrow till friday
hopeless like a penny with a hole i'll say
need 20 dollars that i can borrow till friday
need 20 dollars that i can borrow till friday
