hey there , weird kid in your high - top shoes
sitting in the back of the class ; i was just like you
always left out , never fit in
owning that path you're walking in
mr. misunderstood , mr. misunderstood
now , your buddies get their rocks off on top 40 radio
but you love your daddy's vinyl , old - time rock and roll
elvis costello , ray wylie hubbard
and think jeff tweedy is one bad mother
mr. misunderstood , mr. misunderstood
one day you'll lead the charge , you'll lead the band
guitar hero with lightnin' hands
and the girls will like your tattoos and the veins in your arms
they'll be helpless to your musical charms
and they'll all hold up their hands
they'll all wanna dance
mr. misunderstood , mr. misunderstood
first time i met alabama hannah , i was skinny as a rail
red hair tied up in a blue bandanna
she was hotter than the devil's hell
she turned me on to back porch pickers
jackson pollock , and gin
her daddy didn't trust my intentions
so he turned to his daddy's old .410
i'm mr. misunderstood , mr. misunderstood
had an axe to grind , so off i went
mad at the sun for coming up again
i lost religion , found my soul in the blues
rubbed the velvet off my blue suede shoes
yeah , everybody held up their hands
and every soul on beale street danced
with mr. misunderstood , mr. misunderstood
so i went with it like a colt on my plymouth
through the glass behind my rear - view
took a left when the world went right down 16th avenue
played with fire and i played on ledges
every circus , stage , and county fair
they tried to file my points , sand my edges
and i just grew out my hair
i'm mr. misunderstood , i'm mr. misunderstood
they're standing in line , chasing the buzz
til the next big things and already was
and hell if they know what they're trying to find
if it ain't that same old , been - done kind
yeah , gives the head - scratchers fits
wondering how in the hell they missed
i'm mr. misunderstood , mr. misunderstood
hey there , weird kid in your high - top shoes
sitting in the back of the class ; i was just like you
mr. misunderstood ( i understand )
mr. misunderstood ( i understand )
mr. misunderstood ( i understand )

i'm mr. misunderstood ( let's go out of here )
