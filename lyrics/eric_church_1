since you turned the tables on me
i've been steady and learnin' lonely
keepin' this turntable spinnin'
everything from jones to jennings
slowly plannin' my survival
in a three - foot stack of vinyl
since you had to walk on outta here
i've been havin' a record year
i bet you thought before you left
i'd just sit in silence by myself
turn this house into a jail
dyin' slow in a livin' hell
but love's got a funny way of keepin' score
and your leavin' lit up my scoreboard
i usually make it through side a sober
all bets are off when i flip her over
one bourbon , one scotch , one beer
i'm havin' a record year
quarter notes and hank's half time
are poundin' on this heart of mine
song to song , i pass my time
with these speakers on ten
your good - and - gone keeps me up all night
along with songs in the key of life
i'm either gonna get over you
or i'm gonna blow out my ears
yeah , you're out there now
doin' god knows how , and i'm stuck here
havin' a record year
your leavin' left me goin' crazy
i'm countin' on a needle to save me
i drop it in the groove
and we go 'round and 'round
and down in a spiral
i guess i really oughta call and thank you
i rediscovered red headed stranger
got down with old james brown
and found new grass revival
if you find your way back , i owe you a beer
for my record year
quarter notes and hank's half time
are poundin' on this heart of mine
song to song , i pass my time
with these speakers on ten
your good - and - gone keeps me up all night
along with songs in the key of life
i'm either gonna get over you
or i'm gonna blow out my ears
yeah , you're out there now
doin' god knows how , and i'm stuck here
havin' a record year
yeah , i'm havin' a record year
