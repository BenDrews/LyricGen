i , i been gone i been gone too long singing my songs on the road
another town one more show and i'm coming home
don't give a damn what these keys i hold i'm gonna knock down that front door , and
i'ma find out what that house is made of
it's been too many nights since its felt us make love
i wanna rock some sheetrock , knock some pictures off the wall
love you baby , like a wrecking ball
you... look at you send me one more shot sitting on a bathroom sink
damn you really turn me on painting your toenails pink
easy baby before you say but if i can make it just one more day , and
that old house is gonna be shaking
i hope those bricks and boards can take it
but i won't be surprised if the whole damn place just falls
i'm gonna rock you baby , like a wrecking ball
and that old house is gonna be shaking
rafter and rocking foundation quaking
crash right through the front door , back you up against the wall
love you baby take it right there baby rock you baby , like a wrecking ball
