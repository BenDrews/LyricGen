turn on a neon light
at least make it feel like night
put on some this or that
and maybe i won't feel so bad
need a little background noise
to drown out this little voice
running circles 'round my brain
screaming louder than the pain
my head is spinning
my resolve is reeling
i can tell by the heavy in my heart
i'm going down soon
no use fighting the fight
it's no contest tonight
my figured out's never been more confused
having mixed drinks about feelings and you
turn off the bedroom light
put on a brave face and face the night
it's either get used to this dread
or the cold spot in our bed
the bottle helps , but the memory burns
the whiskey soothes , but i toss and turn
i'll find sleep 'til dreams relent
wake up tired and try again
my head is spinning
my resolve is reeling
i can tell by the heavy in my heart
i'm going down soon
no use fighting the fight
it's no contest tonight
my figured out's never been more confused
having mixed drinks about feelings and you
having mixed drinks about feelings and you
turn on a neon light
at least make it feel like night
