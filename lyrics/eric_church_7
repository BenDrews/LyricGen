another friday night
there's a line of cars leaving
home team's got an out - of - towner
me , i'm sitting on the hood of mine drinking
i'm just a parking lot down - and - outer
under that high school bleacher
i drove that preacher's daughter crazy
her mama was my homeroom teacher
and her dad was hell bent on saving me
yeah , i'm sure there's higher highs
where the high risers rise
but me , i'm gonna sit right here tonight , and
catch me a 'round here buzz
cause you ain't 'round here none
keep putting 'em down here , 'nother round here
'til my down goes up
lit up like that one stoplight
across from that welcome sign
ever since you caught that out there bug
i catch me a 'round here buzz
i never had big - city eyes
hell , i've never been east of dallas
got no idea where you are now
or if you ever got that penthouse palace
no , scotty's ain't got no vibe
got no gas in his neon light
but he's got two - for - one 'til 2 : 00 tonight
catch me a 'round here buzz
cause you ain't 'round here none
keep putting 'em down here , 'nother round here
'til my down goes up
lit up like that one stoplight
across from that welcome sign
ever since you caught that out there bug
i catch me a 'round here buzz
catch me a 'round here buzz
cause you ain't 'round here none
keep putting 'em down here , 'nother round here
'til my down here
is lit up like that one stoplight
across from that welcome sign
ever since you caught that out there bug
i catch me a 'round here buzz
i catch me a 'round here buzz
'round here buzz
i catch me a 'round here buzz
