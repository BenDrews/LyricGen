if i could kill a word and watch it die
i'd poison " never , " shoot goodbye
beat " regret " when i felt i had the nerve
yeah , i'd pound " fear " to a pile of sand
choke " lonely " out with my bare hands
i'd hang " hate " so that it can't be heard
if i could only kill a word
i'd take " brokeness " out back
and break " heartbreak , " stand there and laugh
right in its face while shootin' it the bird
i'd put " upset " down in its place
i'd squeeze the life out of " disgrace "
lay " over " under six cold feet of dirt
if i could only kill a word
give me sticks , give stones
bend my body , break my bones
use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
cause you can't unhear , you can't unsay
but if were up to me to change
i'd turn " lies " and " hate " to " love " and " truth "
if i could only kill a word
i'd knock out " temptation " 's teeth
i'd sever " evil , " let it bleed
then light up " wicked , " stand and watch it burn
i'd take " vice " and i'd take " vile "
tie 'em up there with " hostile "
hang 'em high and leave 'em for the birds
if i could only kill a word
so give me sticks , give stones
bend my body , break my bones
use staff and rod to turn me black and blue
cause you can't unhear , you can't unsay
but if were up to me to change
i'd turn " lies " and " hate " to " love " and " truth "
if i could only kill a word
if i could only kill a word
