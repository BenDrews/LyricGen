i still remember miss bessie singing
black , wrinkled fingers on ivory keys
just five years old , my church shoes a - dangling
yeah , she's long gone and i'm still chasing this song
with a guitar full of freedom and a head full of lines
that nightlife full of demons has been a hell of a ride
i got a crazy heart , but i was born to lose it
married to a dream with a mistress named music
no hope and squarely solitary
enough whiskey and coke , boys , to get me in a bind
amps juiced , the whole damn block could hear me
even that cop car rolling past
by the time they hit the front door
i was out the back
with a guitar full of freedom and a head full of lines
that nightlife full of demons has been a hell of a ride
i got a crazy heart , and i was born to lose it
married to a dream with a mistress named music
white calloused fingers on bronze and nylon
these same old boots are still tapping time
not quite the buzz i used to tie on
but 'til i'm gone , i'll be chasing this song
with a guitar full of freedom and a head full of lines
that nightlife full of demons has been a hell of a ride
i got a crazy heart , and i was born to lose it
married to a dream with a mistress named music
yeah , i'm married to a dream with a mistress named music
