see me sitting cynically
shutting out critics for my sensitivity
cleansing specific hostility
sulking shame whilst sipping hennessy
shots emptied extremely efficiently
bac affecting me anemically
enacting an epic emergency
eclipsing my emotions eerily
frightful fight or flight
focused on fucking tonight
falling in head first , fixated
on finally finding misses right
glancing around gauging for a gentle gaunt gal
gambling with hope , gay with faith in generous gifts coming down
from god , yet atheism galloped gallantly within
while guiness also garnered doubt of garish , gaudy sin
and i catch a glimpse from across the bar
a sweet young dime by the looks of her
we lock eyes and feel something stir
feel like she the one i've been looking for
so i walk over planning to flirt a bit
you know , hit her with that player shit
she alone at a table so i ask to sit
i said , " baby girl , you look immaculate
been working on a line can i practice it
on someone as beautifully graced as you ?
i got one night and an uber too
so give me two hours to humor you
if it don't work out then that's okay
we'll go our own ways after today
i don't even need your name tonight
but may i call you misses right ? "
