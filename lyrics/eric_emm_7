verse 1 :
i'm the arsenal , i got artillery , lyrics of ammo
rounds of rhythm , then i'mm'a give 'em piano
bring a bullet - proof vest , nothin' to ricochet
ready to aim at the brain , now what the trigger say
tempos triflin' , felt like a rifle , massage 'n' melodies
might go right through simultaneously , like an uzi
nothin' can bruise me , lyrics let up , when lady say don't lose me
so re - load quickly , and you better hit me
while i'm lettin' this fifi , get wit me
you steppin' with double - zero - seven ( .007 ) , better make it snappy
no time to do your hair baby , brothers are bustin' at me
beats and bullets pass me , none on target
they want the r hit , but watch the god get -
quicker , the tongue is the trigger , cause i'm real fast
let off some rhythm at 'em , let 'em feel the blast
penetrate at a crazy rate , this ain't no thirty - eight ( .38 )
hit 'em at point blank range , and watch 'em radiate
runnin' out of ammunition , i'm done wit' em
you ask me how i did 'em , i let the rhythm hit 'em
reprise :
let it hit 'em
verse 2 :
i push a power that's punishable , prepare to be a prisoner
the hit man is the , brother wit' charisma
showing you that i have , powerful paragraphs
followers become leaders , nut without a path
ya mentally paralyzed , crippled ya third eye
rhymes are blurred , then it occurred that you heard i -
reduced the friction , with crucifixion
let loose the mix then , boost the piston
eric hit 'em with' some of that cut , like a lumberjack
and me gettin' hit back , it won't be none of that
i'm untouchable , you see me in three - d ( 3 - d )
when i let the rhythm , hit another emcee
lyrics made of lead , enters your head
then eruptions of a mass production , will spread
when music is louder , full of gunpowder
microphone machinery , when i see a crowd of -
party people , pumpin' their fist like this
ya hide in the back , thinkin' that i might miss
but the r is accurate , plus i'm packed up with
educated punch lines that i have to hit
whatever i aim at , i line 'em up
ya body is weak , feel with pain , that time is up
you been hit with somethin' different , isn't it ?
rakim is gonna radiate and nothing's equivalent
nothin' can harm me , why try to bar me ?
you couldn't fuck around the ra , with an army
you'll get wrecked by the architect , so respect him
i disconnect 'em , soon as i inject 'em , with radiation
put 'em by the basement , bust his chest open
bash his face in , let it split him
since he brought his main man wit' him
he ask me how i did 'em , i let the rhythm hit 'em
reprise :
let it hit 'em
verse 3 :
dance floor's dangerous , packed in like a briefcase
rhythm with real rough rhyme , beats with deep bass
girls with tight pants , maybe they might dance
tonight if the r's on the mic , there's a slight chance
the crowd is crucial , emcee grounds are neutral
now that you're here , let me introduce you
get ready , i'm hard to read , like graffiti
but steady , science i drop is real heavy
radiant energy , that'll be the penalty
touch the third rail , on the pain of remedy
the prescription's one every hour , now it's a habit
ya need another hit , from the freestyle fanatic
attention : follow directions , real close
keep out of reach of children , beware of overdose
too many milligram , no one made an iller jam
my rhyme , is the rhythm of thoughts that kill a man
ideas for the ear to fear , might split him
he'll never forget 'em , he'll rest in peace wit' 'em
at least when he left , he'll know what hit him
the last breath of the words of death , was the rhythm
reprise :
let it hit 'em ( x4 )
verse 4 :
now throw you hands in the air and yo , go
rakim will do the rest of this slow
if i speed they know , you'll blow the hell up
if i slow up they'll catch up , hell no
wicked as i kicked it , don't need to remix it
cause i prefixed it , reversed and switched it
to perform to perfection , section for section
rhymes keep connectin' , ya guessin' what's next and
blood pressure rises , ya damn near lost it
ya hit the ground burnin' , and woke up frostbit
cause when i explained , ya can't complain for pain
travel through the brain , hit a vein , then remain
let it radiate , vibes will vibrate , why did you violate ?
now i'm'ma have to let the style break
moans now , the tone is ingrown
after this here's thrown , gimme another microphone
before i get that , fifi i met
whisper , " i wanna reach her intellect "
kiss her , cause i wanna give her the most respect
so i shine and let the write reflect
hold her , mold her , make her feel older
lay her on my shoulder , everything i told her
makes her feel secure , whenever i'm wit' her
and you know how i did her , me and the rhythm hit her
