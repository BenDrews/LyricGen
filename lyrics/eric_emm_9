when i go and i get lonely , i begin to think of you
but i know a dream is only , im a fool
someone said that ud be long gone
not to waste my time on u
i see u everyday and sunshine im a fool
am i the fool to you ? oh yeah
emerald eyes i see u somewhere
why your eyes so blue ?
love can be like holding your breath
is that the way fools do ?
haven't time to talk about it
i admit ive been a fool
thought i shouldn't think about it
i need you can't stop this feeling
am i the fool to you ?
emerald eyes i see you somewhere
why your eyes so blue ?
love can be like holding your breath
is that the way fools do ?
emerald eyes i see you somewhere
why your eyes so blue ?
love can be like holding your breath
is that the way fools do ?
emerald eyes i see you somewhere
why your eyes so blue ?
love can be like holding your breath
is that the way fools do ?
