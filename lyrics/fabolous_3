a thousand pieces in a jigsaw of beautiful mistakes
the debris of beauty flickers
in the sadness of a smile
it’s the perfection of your imperfection
beauty's when you just got out the shower
hair still drippin' , wrapped up in a towel
beauty's when you ready in a hour
them long legs , i call em the twin towers
you put that arch in it , put your hand on your hip
put your hair in a bun , and you handle the shit
beauty’s when the strut compliments sass
you know ya booty look good wit ya confident ass ( shit )
straight up , but the rest swerve
you know it's beauty when the smile is her best curve
that's real beauty , no makeup shit
the girl you dream about , and wanna wake up with
wait until i'm lookin then you throw it at me
go down on me , then you look up at me
awhh man , that shit right there
probably give your ex nightmares
miss brooklyn new york
i'll give you whatever to get to your heart
know your worth baby girl , love
this soul tape shit
never make shift , all naturale
put it down
young ralph , let's get it
beauty is knowing nobody's real as you
truly condolences for that pairs of shoes
killing the scene , this type of love will make you complete
now roll the weed and get the munchies , she be the cuisine
when im her jeans i'm still in tune with the inner being
her inner thoughts , her worst fears she give to me
beauty is loyalty to the fullest
‘cause cupid made me a target for she had received a bullet
for she i get super deep , maybe speed up
before i pull out and sex is a weapon
but beauty don’t need a bullet
beauty is the beauty that her mother gave her
may you be guarded by god , me and grandmamas angels
it's god given , never complicated
a lot of niggas talking , i don’t have the heart to say it
the heart to tell you they see potential in how you do it
i pray you know your worth when niggas don’t notice your beauty , truly
you see , beauty isn't a rush
it's a process , sometimes it's slow
yeah , i mean there's beauty in everything , ya know
you just gotta recognize it
shoutout to the people who do
and i feel sorry for the people who don't
