body language is the only talk he fluent in
he knew it was going down when he flew me in
anything that i got on he wanna do me in
now all these non - discrete bitches wanna do me in
uh , gold ap on me
he know all his niggas wanna put the d on me
even dr. dre went and put the b on me
but my pussy so exclusive , limited edition
you know niggas love pretty bitches with ambition
bees on the keys , never go in the ignition
b - b - but when i ride it , do it to precision
i could tell that he trippin' , every time that i slip in
when he 'bout to come , i start to kiss his neck
i let him score , but we ditch the ref'
when we going out , we gotta ditch the press
ah man , i got his bitch depressed
