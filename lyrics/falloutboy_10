i took cutie for a ride in my death cab
she tipped me with a kiss , i dropped her off at the meth lab
before she left , she made a dashboard confessional
then spilled her guts in cursive , but what's worse
is i could still see her bright eyes like sunny day real estate
oh my , and the funny way the ceiling tastes x
so high , but no chance
my little chemical romance , left a bad taste in my mouth
but i approached her like , hey mercedes , why the long face ?
why you cryin , no need , just put on this coheed , and fallout
boy meets girl , jimmy eat world
but schlep eats pills 'til he's all out
not once , not twice , she was thrice times a lady
actin all brand new , but i had to
bounce to the postal services to
pick up these pills that take care of my nervousness
and , on the way , i saw planes and mistook 'em for stars
she played games , but she took 'em too far
at the drive - in , watchin' soft porn and you could tell
by the trail of the dead that there was something in the popcorn
hop in my cab , destination midtown
just to get up with some kids that like to get down
i made my rounds and that was that
in between the frowns and scraps and heartattacks
and i remember
i seen her ass early november
on a thursday , taking back sunday for a refund
she shot a wink , like no hard feelings
then she jetted to brazil , man , them pills had me spun
yeah , this the story of the year right here
this is hot water music
cook your ramens to it
whattup elliott i ain't seen you in a minute
how you doin ?
