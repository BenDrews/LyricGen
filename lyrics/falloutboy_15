verse 1 : ( crooked i )
i'm the product of a cheap condom accidents happen
my dad never knew he had a bastard kid rappin'
sad when i met the man , imagine him laughin'
sayin' i wish i could've wiped you off the matress with napkins
to him , my whole life is only worth a lame joke
to me , him and marvin gaye's father are in the same boat
all i had was mama , all we had was drama
so i'm a armed robber who needs body armor for all my karma
it's hard for me to breathe , i'm that gone
no woman can be my backbone , that's what part of me believe
'cause soon as they get close , it's like pardon me i leave
cupid shot at my chest but my heart was on my sleeve
in the dark i'm on my knees , prayin' to understand stuff
suicide rumblin' in my head as i stand up
gun in my waist tumblin' down my leg through my pant cuff
i'm reachin' for it , i'm thinkin' please ignore it
( i'm sick of me... )
chorus : niggas feel you over here my nigga , word
niggas hear you over here my nigga
they see you over here , they need you over here
niggas wanna be you over here , my nigga
tears of fire
niggas feel you over here my nigga , word
tears of fire
niggas hear you over here my nigga
tears of fire
tears of fire
verse 2 : ( charles hamilton )
yo , crooked , look at this shit that i put up with is it a crime ?
to love your niggas and wish they were fine
at the same time , you ain't fine , reason would be the fallout
boy , call out the names , of people that brought out the flames
that i cry , no enjoyin' my haze
get the choices to get played
they be in your face like oil of olay
but no , goin' away for the poisonous taste of your boys when they annoyin' and they know it's okay
to , fire late , a toy in the cage
what seems wack , until you lean back and get it nigga
the cage comes second when you buy the figure
so for that money , i'm a violent nigga
vibin' wit'cha from a minds distance
by the way , respect is riches , i'm mindin' my business
die quicker than the buzz , of a nigga doin' drugs
'till he's hit by a truck , listen to us mothafucka
chorus : niggas feel you over here my nigga , word
niggas hear you over here my nigga
they see you over here , they need you over here
niggas wanna be you over here , my nigga
tears of fire
niggas feel you over here my nigga , word
tears of fire
niggas hear you over here my nigga
tears of fire
tears of fire
