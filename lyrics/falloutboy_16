hd babe !
uh , yeah
drey , smith , and danver
i told 'em but they ain't wanna listen
get a search party cause their pride went missin'
they hatin' , but then again it ain't my business
i'm just tryna do it til the finish , finish
i am not a language , but i am the talk of the town
i am not in fame yet , but i have been walkin' around
and they've been talkin' about
a kid who's coppin' the crown
comin' with a lotta emotions , i'm causin' their frowns
headed to the top , no plane
that's why i'm feelin' high though i hate cocaine
i'm grounded in music , i can't play no games
and if y'all are confused , i'm child's play , no games
now i need a wife to raise these fucking bars with
chase these fucking stars with
but a bitch will never change me , i am not a cartridge
party at my crib , but please don't bring your bruhs with
yeah we gon' get naughty but please don't leave your bra , bitch
doc shebeleza makes me dance
all my haters make me laugh
i'm just waiting for this cash to come
flying through the window like a little bird
til my verses are rehearsed
i'ma keep making my voice heard like...
i told 'em but they ain't wanna listen
get a search party cause their pride went missin'
they hatin' , but then again it ain't my business
i'm just tryna do it til the finish , finish
mars , yeah
scribe my name around the charts like this shit is necessary
legendary i'm killing burying niggas in cemeteries
giving honours to mothers of sons like virgin mary
hoping i never fall , can see it like visionaries
gospel to the streets i give it like missionaries
i'm starting to feel like pac when i'm representing the streets and i do this shit for the block as i'm busy cooking em beef
niggas thinking i'm trippin' i'm thinking i need a navigator
i'm tryna grow up , tryna blow up need a detonator
step on the shit and see the levels like an elevator
the escalator , all you bitch niggas hala later
got the typa flow to dead bodies i'm the escavator
bombs on a train , now its true that i'm killing these tracks
that legendary nigga , tell em i'm drilling these flex
its all real here , all we do is kill here
that legendary shit , six years and i'm still here
mars
i told 'em but they ain't wanna listen
get a search party cause their pride went missin'
they hatin' , but then again it ain't my business
i'm just tryna do it til the finish , finish
yeah
smitherapy in session mayne
when i started this journey they all thought i was trippin'
when i spit they didn't feel me labeled my skill just a gimmick
didn't listen to them critics but focused on pushing limits
now i'm killing swallow grenades spit bombs heavy artillery
coming through like a bullet penetrating every heart
slam em niggas with lyrics like hulk hogan's arms
harvest my talent like i have a lyrical farm
now a crop of new rappers are eating straight from my palms
man of the year join the queue lemme school you boy
i run this game so i put athletics on toys
it's bubblegum rap that probably gets hip hop destroyed
you can't rock and roll it , fallout boy
a descendant of big and pac i'm a dynasty
they left me a legacy to be a man of pedigree
a fiercely animal , mike tyson legendary
the air you can't live without , essential necessary
i told 'em but they ain't wanna listen
get a search party cause their pride went missin'
they hatin' , but then again it ain't my business
i'm just tryna do it til the finish , finish
y'all heard it
it's hd music
it's the fingerprint
yeah
