i'm not settin the world on fire
and i'm too old for american idol
and i don't look or dress like some celebrity
but i don't mind what i see
and besides , i'm alright with being me
i know my songs have never been
a perfect fit for the box that they're crammed in
i'm not quite rock , not quite pop , not quite country
but it still sounds good to me
and besides , i'm alright with being me
it means i don't have to go where every songwriter has been
don't need the same worn out tone on my guitar again
bein me means i don't owe nobody anything
and the only reason i need to sing is to sing
i'm not settin the world on fire
and i'm too old for american idol
and i'm not nickelback , or fallout boy or creed
but that's not what i need
and besides , i'm alright. .
yeah i sleep ok at night...
and i know i'll have my time. .
i say i'm doin' fine being me
i'm not settin the world on fire
but , hey , screw the idol
