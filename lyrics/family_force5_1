i will show you crazy , i'm a maniac
no more final warning , i'm not holdin' back
i ain't goin' no where , let the roof cave in
'bout to blow up somethin' , here goes nothin'
watch me hit the cray button
cray ! cray ! cray !
let's get cray , turn it all the way up
got a double dose of bass , you love it so much
get outta your head , get outta your skull
if you ain't gettin' cray , then you ain't got a pulse
a lunatic in town , bomb just got dropped
i get cray all day , it's my full time job
wild like a wolf pack howlin' at the moon
attack , attack
you've been bitten by the boom
i ain't goin' no where , let the roof cave in
'bout to blow up somethin' , here goes nothin'
watch me hit the cray button
cray ! cray ! cray !
put your fives in the sky if you're feelin alive
throw ten up in the air
cus you don’t care
cray bands on
rock your cray on
3 , 2 , 1 , detonation !
i wonder what happens if i hit the cray button
i guarantee the whole place starts jumpin'
i wonder what happens if i hit the cray button
i guarantee the whole place starts jumpin'
i wonder what happens if i hit the cray button
i guarantee the whole place starts jumpin'
