from another planet , planet , planet
beauty crash landed , landed , landed
see it getting closer , closer , closer
feel it taking over , over me
maybe this could be supernatural
when you look at me , it's so magical
feeling my heartbeat three - dimensional
i'll go anywhere you go
no , i never felt this way in my life
my life , my life , my life
you - ou - ou - ou take me , take me
you - ou - ou - ou take me out of this world
you - ou - ou - ou take me , take me
you - ou - ou - ou take me out of this world
turn the sound up louder , louder
i can feel it's power power
million miles an hour , hour
now it's taking over me
maybe this could be supernatural
when you look at me , it's so magical
feeling my heartbeat three - dimensional
i'll go anywhere you go
and your love it keeps on taking me higher
no , i never felt this way in my life
my life , my life , my life ( oh oh oh )
you - ou - ou - ou take me , take me
you - ou - ou - ou take me out of this world
you - ou - ou - ou take me , take me
and your love it keeps on taking me higher
no , i never felt this way in my life
my life , my life , my life ( oh oh )
you - ou - ou - ou take me , take me
you - ou - ou - ou take me out of this world
