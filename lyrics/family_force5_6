i'm closer to you , but i feel like i'm so far away
‘cause i let my fear , let my fear get in front of my faith
i’m back and forth like a wave in the wind
but i hear your voice , and it's pulling me in , it’s pulling me in
i wanna walk on water
take a leap
and step out knowing
you won’t let me sink
i wanna trust you deeper
live life believin’
that you are
everything you say you are
‘cause you’re everything you say you are
i've prayed your proof , and i've asked you to give me a sign
but you already did when you traded your life for mine , for mine
you call my name through the rain and the wind
i hear your voice and it's pulling me in , you're pulling me in
i wanna walk on water
take a leap
and step out knowing
you won’t let me sink
i wanna trust you deeper
live life believin’
that you are
everything you say you are
‘cause you’re everything you say you are
you're the start and the ending
you're the reason for living
you're the beat in every heart
you're everything you say are
i wanna walk on water
take the leap
step out knowing
you won’t let me sink
trust you deeper
keep believin’
that you are
i wanna walk on water
take a leap
and step out knowing
you won’t let me sink
i wanna trust you deeper
live life believin’
that you are
everything you say you are
‘cause you’re everything you say you are
you’re the beat in every heart
you’re everything you say you are
