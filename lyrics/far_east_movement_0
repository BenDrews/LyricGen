freal luv
freal luv
know no limits to feel the truth
when the world stops spinning
i'll know it's you
searching all night , like a spotlight
for the one to show
could it be you ? could it be me ?
only way to know
freal luv
i'm all yours , when you really wanna take me there
don't let me go nowhere
i'd give it all up for you , i swear
only for real love
that love that keeps me shaking
so real , there's no mistaking
i'd give it all up for you , i swear
only for real love
lovin that real love , something you feel love
turning me back to the old me
ride for my realla , i die for my realla
i give you respect like the ogs
lockin' me down like the police
we ain't never be lonely
protectin’ my love like a goalie
you'll be the only one next to me right with the homies
we got that empire mind
combine n’ steadily rise ( that be freal )
moment of truth of has arrived
trust that forever you ride ( that be freal )
you be the bank on my side
you supervise , let's make a deal
let's get it sealed , let's make it trill
let's rule the world , together freal
freal luv ( give me that , real luv , that real love , that chill love )
freal luv
freal luv ( give me that , real luv , that real love , that chill love )
freal luv
i'm all yours , when you really wanna take me there
don't let me go nowhere
i'd give it all up for you , i swear
only for real love
i'm all yours , when you really wanna take me there
don't let me go nowhere
i'd give it all up for you , i swear
only for real love
that love that keeps me shaking
so real , there's no mistaking
i'd give it all up for you , i swear
only for real love
love is a high , we feelin’ alive
you lovin’ the size , 이 흐름을 타
i give you more , you feelin’ the flow
you never let none of them bring down the vibe
hustle to win , we be livin’ in sin
makin’ us two of a kind
새로운 길 , babe we got temples to build
ain't no haters can step to our grind
we got that empire mind
함께 천천히 올라 , ( that be freal )
진실이 닿는 순간
느껴봐 눈을 감아 , ( that be freal )
you be the bank on my side , nothing but dimes
let’s make a deal
서서히 필 , 꿈과 현실
내 손을 잡으면 , together freal
