( schoolboy q )
50 grand large , rubber band boy , haze and drank
i can moon walk , make her ass talk
i'm a cash vault , trigger then spark , hear my trunk bump
we go dumb dumb , dumb dumb , i'ma do it some
now watch me stunt , i'ma leave with one
though i came with none , now watch me come
i'm a pimp with a gold stripper ho from the soul be the game i run
it was shots through the cot giddy up , put it on your tongue
( hook )
we be the illest
we be the illest in here
i know you feel us
we be the illest in here
illest in here ( x2 )
we so muthafuckin' ill !
( verse 1 : kev nish )

got a v - mail from my k - town chick that wanna hook up and blaze
i got og cannabis ( can i bust ? ) , girl , one puff will put you in your grave
got three pills , and four jimmy hats cause we don't kid and play
popov , yo , guess who's getting drunk , no muthafuckas can't out - drink us
if you sipping that hate , don't get drowned , so cold polar bears on my nuts
y'all know who we be , i hold it down for the east
cause i keeps it pimpin' , peter griffin , yellow tinted on z's
( bridge : j - splif )
drippin' on yo couches
drippin' on yo couches
sippin' tanqueray with orange bang we on that tropicana
drippin' on yo couches
from the hills to public housing
if you feelin' ill then damn you ill
be the illest on a thousand
( hook )
( verse 2 : riff raff )
yeah , nice chain , what a nice night
my ice bright , i play the wall like a night - light
tangerine tambourine from the west wing
the best thing about my room ? versace bed springs
i'm in the building , more gold than rumpelstiltskin
aw shit , look who it is : the white russell simmons
jody highroller , far east movement
we so ill , i think i need some codeine fluid
riff !
( b.o.b )
badaboom badabambi
every day in her hair like pantene
pro b , ain't ready for a family
fuck family , so she better have a plan b
plan b , never mind what the rumors say
rumors say , never mind what the rumors say
rumors say , when i walk into a room they say
bobby ray , bomaye , bomaye
i'm faded , my eyes are glazin' , dialated
you hate that that nigga made it so you jaded
your momma , your baby momma , and your lady
be bumpin' my music naked while they're shavin'
thots be like " bobby save me , bobby save me "
but this ain't no bank for checkin' , ain't no savin'
i'm never known to accept a limitation
you want it with me well here's the invitation
bands , bobby , there's no more debatin' , wow i'm just amazin'
damn , she started gettin' naked 'till her panties start wavin'
man , man i'm so sick , i'm so ill
thermometers cannot monitor my level of chill
grippin' the grain , whippin' the wheel
( hook )
" i " is for the way these beezies love how i bang
and " double l " is for the way i blow that smoke in ya face
we roll on " e's " and we be easy rollin that bank
and " st " is for the illest shit we rep every day
