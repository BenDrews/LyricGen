little bird , have you got a key ?
unlock the lock , inside of me
ya , i had a dream baby , you could get high off me
you could fly for free , if i save you babe
would you light the street that's inside of me
can't breathe baby , no you can't feel your feet
cause this ain't that dream ain't it
bird you're too high to see that the high is me
and all my life i've been living for love
hold me down , i'mma hold you up
when it go down , i'mma get my love
cause you just can't get enough
let's make believe baby , you couldn't fly from me
wouldn't walk up on that wire
on the low wouldn't lie to me
wouldn't creep out for that dime one more time
only lay asleep , cause this ain't that dream ain't it
bird you're too high to see that the high is me
yeah , nothing what it seems , baby girl's just a fiend
when she come down it was all a dream
best believe , cause it ain't worth the steam
little bird don't clip your wings
i figure when you get down do you get low ?
maybe you should quit now when it felt true
either way we know what we got worth more than dough
when you're high don't fly alone
