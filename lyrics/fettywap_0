i just wanna chill , got a sack for us to roll
married to the money , introduced her to my stove
showed her how to whip it , now she remixin' for low
she my trap queen , let her hit the bando
we be countin' up , watch how far them bands go
we just set a goal , talkin' matchin' lambos
at 56 a gram , 5 a 100 grams though

hit the strip club , we be letting bands go
everybody hating , we just call them fans , though
in love with the money , i ain't never lettin' go
