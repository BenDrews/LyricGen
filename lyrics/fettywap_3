but first off i'mma start by sayin' this , ayy
all headshots if you think you could take my bitch , ayy
and i'm too turnt , when i shoot , swear i won't miss , ayy

and i might put you on , bitch , it's mine can't you see ?
and i rock seventeen , all these knots in my jeans
me and zoo turnin' up , got your boo in the cut
and she sue cause it's looking like the roof going up
counting all this bread , i don't talk to feds
try and take my bitch , you gonna take two to the head
cause baby you the baddest , all this money , i'mma cash it
and i'm swervin' all in traffic
while i'm trapping out the mansion
and i'm moving through the tri - state
do two - hundred on the highway
and i'm swerving in my i8
baby , you should come my way
squad !
