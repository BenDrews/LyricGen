so much grams , unzip the bag
dip in my hand , then i palm trees
so when you throw shade , it could never harm me
( so when you throw shade , it could never harm me )

lions don't lose sleep over the 'pinion of sheep
on the road to the riches , money sticking to my cleats
i am moi , magnifique , skin noir , darky meech
niggas with the most opinions usually have the least
it's funny how now rappers be on their druggy shit
downloaded my tape , sat back , studied shit
acid pack a hundred hits , shroom caps and hash bricks
trippy like that destiny child chick on 106
this white bitch had the fucking nerve to call me a nigga
when she the one paying the surgeon for her lips to get bigger
do you get the bigger picture ? shit is backwards , my nigga
you sneak dissing , taking jabs , get your boxing on
cause you ain't get the word , i'm glock lesnar in the octagon
this shit is straight absurd , do not hate me cause your life is shitty
i show no pity , you turd , you better off in the dirt
now you better off dead , like the title of my work
so much grams , unzip the bag
dip in my hand , then i palm trees
so when you throw shade , it could never harm me
( so when you throw shade , it could never harm me )

everyday , me and mary jane
you might say i'm addicted , but me , i'm truly lifted
stoned so loud , you can hear me in the crowd
smoking girl scout , sour by the ounce
mary never cheat me
mary not a backstabbing bitch that'll lie and deceive me
spread it even , even , hash wax in the evening
dab or die trying , on the road to zion
damn , they try and stick me for my paper
they trying to take me under , i've seen it through the vapors
jealous ones still envy , got a couple real with me
and my bitch will talk some shit and smoke the kil' with me
meech will hide the body , enough of that though
they saying talk is cheap , so i'll be smiling when we meet
they screaming " zombies ! " out in england
but i'm on the block with mary , pushing and dreaming
ah ah ah , i'm feeling myself
thizzle , fo' shizzle , my nizzle , spitting riddles on instrumentals
trippy life , blotter in the night
fill my appetite ( fill my appetite )
so much grams , unzip the bag
dip in my hand , then i palm trees
so when you throw shade , it could never harm me
( so when you throw shade , it could never harm me )
so much grams , unzip the bag

could be your mans , or be your fan , or be your kin
pay your dues , man , i gotta choose , whether i lose or win this
foe or friend , can't determine the difference
the instance they see you peaking , they pussy be leaking fluid
my nigga , what is you doing , all black in the back of a buick
i'm proving i'm sadistic as sin , as i'm making murderous music
we don't rep the same things , nah , don't bother confuse it
so much stressing on my brain , momma think i'ma lose it
human vagabond , hoes that stow they panties in my carry on
why you hating niggas acting nonchalant ( honest , bro )
fuck your publication that say i'm a third wheel
architect build your mind , set stress but won't swell
oh yes , i smoke kill , i'm crack , you smoke krills
i pack , you dope deal , in fact , i'm so chill
i'm never off the pivot , six stitches to your image
not offended when you call me genius , all that means is
so much grams , unzip the bag
dip in my hand , then i palm trees
so when you throw shade , it could never harm me
( so when you throw shade , it could never harm me )
so much grams , unzip the bag
