what the bloodclot ? what the blood
get m - e - t - h - o - d , drought 3 dwayne carter
with a splash of busta's craft and a hint of big poppa
little dash of nasty nas , top it off with bob marley
throw 'em all in a blender and i'm what the fuck you get
and imagine that like a figment
i'm a walking , talking enigma
something you never figure
ni - ni - ni - ni - nigga , i am like randy savage on acid
that's very vibrant and classic
a walking disaster , hazard to any rapper
thatâ€™s rapping , we the underground killas
but globally they feel us cause we restoring the feeling
this guru spit voodoo , yes
i am that mass appealing , i'm feeling up on her breasts
she swallowing all my children
rack in my mouth , teeth made of gold
i'm sucking the areolas , my nigga , the best of both
double entendre
and if they auctioning niggas , then i'm the top product
what am i saying , they used to auction our forefathers
where is my mind , shit , i can't find it
like looking for remote control after smoking marijuana
how is he so niggerish , yet so enlightened
it can't be possible , he living everything he rhyming
i feel like we entered the game at remarkable timing
broke niggas only make jokes , nigga
i made more than i can fit in this quote , nigga
quote , nigga , we the hope , nigga
flatbush zombie , motherfucker , we the hope , nigga
hope nigga , hope nigga
flatbush zombie , motherfucker , we the hope , nigga
hope nigga , hope nigga
flatbush zombie , motherfucker , we the hope , nigga
i assemble sentences so i can reap the benefits
and i never see my nemesis , but i'm working on my penmanship
i counted many blessings , stressing women , nothing less of winning
if i'm talking shit , shit , man , i'm only kidding
sitting on the sphere , earth is spinning , persevere
2012 is here and still a different kind of fear
it's material , and i ain't talkin fashion
believe in what you want , cause no one knows to seem what happens
ya bastards
since i smoked the cohiba , i'm evil
zombies be competition , six feet deep beneath your people
only illegal amounts of the medicine'll get you in a bind
i already got your heart , girl , i wanna fuck your mind
but since i came , developed my name , the author oughta slap you hard
i never drop the acid , bruh , i'm trippy as fuck
because i'd rather knock it down instead of picking you up
so cut the ash right through the diamond , my hair wrapped up like a shaman
cruising down the street , ain't got a 6 - 4
just a heart full of pride , a mouth full of gold
corny baby mama knocking at my front do'
she just want my income , i'd rather get my dick sucked
i be that z - o - m - b , shawty don't tempt me
leather on , fonzirelli , piss on women , r. kelly
smashing bitches in the telly , passing swishers rolled up with me
trippy is as trippy does , catch me smoking potent , cuz
having visions of mason betha coming back
spitting crack , contemplating how we living under satan
discriminating and hating , this ain't rap
i call it food for the savoring
what's your craving , na - not for paparazzi , the most
incredible dope , feta , cheddar , the revenue
never seen federal , gotta stay 'head of the server , the hedetet
love my medical - hating niggas disguised as friends
i see the lies , wannabes , little gs
peep the a - p - cs , i'm a g - o - d
rep the n - y - c , we got u - n - i , t - y
it's time y'all get off my n - u - t - zs , please
i got the scoop , ain't that about a bitch
take a flick with the microphone ripper , gravedigger
hairy black ball nigga , sicker than your average
twisting dank , fucking hoes on the kitchen sink
what you think ?
