i blink twice 'til my eyes close on my face
deep breaths , struggling to reach home base
awkward nigga , motherfucker , this is a race
god made me great , so i been invisible to hate
partly humane , part of the same , part of the game
used to smoke a parliament before i partied with my pain
and bacardi was the same , 151 to your brain
but i'd rather beg my pardon than to party with you lames
fuck money , fuck friends , fuck family
fuck pussy , fuck drugs , fuck sanity
i don't give a shit , why ?
cause ignorance is bliss , right
fuck the law , fuck the president and white house
fuck the jury , fuck the judge in the nightgown
i don't give a shit , why ?
cause ignorance is bliss , right
sit back and analyze my life like montana did white
all the bitches i hit , and all the bitches i might
clearly underrated amongst all the favorite
but fuck it , my style's like magic speed seduction
i'ma keep smoking 'til my lungs collapse
and fuck y'all laws , i'ma keep my straps
setting the plans , controlling mine and reaching the land
i'm better off dead , somebody fill my head up with lead
dropped out of high school , lint in my pocket
i picked up the profit , the block bitching , bitches is hawking
grandma don't want me , grandpa kinda lonely
pay my dues , wear my jewels , refuse , never i lose
but fuck that , on my last dollar and my bus pass
fucking with some niggas that'll give a mother fuck
who fucking with us ? no one fucking with us , time to reconsider
zombie gang , walking dead , none iller
fuck your faculty , your fans , and your music
fuck the engineer and the nigga that produced it
fuck your religion , your god , and your guidance
tell virgin mary time for meech to pop that hymen
fuck the moon , fuck the stars , fuck venus and mars
fuck a rolex and diamond ring with them flashy cars
fuck the last supper , fuck your church and its gospel
fuck them halfway dead niggas in the hospital
fuck my left lung , fuck my right lung
fuck my chrome gun , fuck my black gun
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
drop five bombs , fuck that i'm on
like the mic i record with , fuck global warming
fuck heaven and hell , purgatory
fuck the pastor , fuck you for giving him offering
fucking exhausted from all these fucks
i'm fucking off this nigga , what the fuck
