smoking good , looking good
girlfriend , what's the issue , huh ?
got them hooked , take a look
a nigga never , ever gonna miss you , girl
get it understood , you looking good
mind and your body gotta equal , girl
how your soul hangs low like the bottom of your red shoes
and i think it's louboutin , too
reality is wisdom , perspective
i like horus , i don't like whores
hindsight , oh my , i adore , for the time being , yes , i am yours
trump , my card , it's the ace of spades
and i hate to go away without getting this money made
but niggas be telling to believe in a reason to act up
nigga lose his job , blame it all on some bad luck
roller coaster , my eyes not open
the cold comes every season , trick
in the summer we smoke hunnids , my fall comes often evil shit
just spews from my mind , i get confused all the time
my wall of space is confined , so you better elevate or lose time
just lose time
smoking good , looking good
girlfriend , what's the issue , huh ?
got them hooked , take a look
a nigga never , ever gonna miss you , girl
get it understood , you looking good
mind and your body gotta equal , girl
how your soul hangs low like the bottom of your red shoes
and i think it's louboutin , too
say dat , i don't play that
i be acting as if i'm a better man
and my mother to my brother from another
boy , oh yes you can
from my sisters that keep the shit right
and my mothers that'll kiss you good night
forty slugs in my liquor cup
take a shot and i pick you up
bang bang from the same gang
kick rocks if you can't hang
lil nigga , what you saying , mane ?
roll up but these lame hangs
rolling up was a plane , mane
in the hood , it's all good , made our own hollywood
took a picture the system my mental track me like a alien
i combine thoughts with divine course
and exhale exhaust from my skeleton
tell her i won't appear again
fuck that , if i'm going , who will even care again ?
hate to be american , get away from experiments
cause the truths in the pyramids
cause we all fucking immigrants
and you're lying through your filaments
lay back if you drink a bit
and indulge in the nigga shit
this is real nigga rhetoric
dissolve all the simple shit , play a different game
it's too easy to be ignorant
lay back , think a bit
smoking good , looking good
girlfriend , what's the issue , huh ?
got them hooked , take a look
a nigga never , ever gonna miss you , girl
get it understood , you looking good
mind and your body gotta equal , girl
how your soul hangs low like the bottom of your red shoes
and i think it's louboutin , too
boy , i must be dreaming
the way you got me speaking
hope that i'm not tripping because
all i do is think about you
now light it up , light it up , you know what to do
one time , one time for my niggas of the indigo
two times , two times for my ladies that are not a ho
one time , one time for my niggas of the indigo
all i do is think about you
now light it up , light it up , you know what to do
angel , want me for my peso
telling other niggas you ain't never gonna wait
so i smash in the range rove
beat beat then i add her to the payroll
smoke another dub with a cousin and a bro
but i won't say it slow
missing , representing the people that won't grow
so i carry lethal weapons that beat you through postal
where the foes go , where we ever gon' go ?
to the highest of the horus eye
fuck thoughts i am going 'til there's no reply
flatline , i get lost 'n bossed
metal cup passed it first
never parked the cars
we ain't boston , nigga
ransom , nigga
we're on some now so explain it to me , nigga
i don't really know but gold ...
