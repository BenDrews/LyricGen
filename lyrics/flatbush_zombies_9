( zombie juice )
spitting shit , disfigured like ligaments
picture the making of this , my hands tied
watch the smoke flow by , by , bye - bye
on the porch , newports , packs of the loud , new bitch packing the crowds
the macking spectacular , is you fucking or nothing ?
mmm , a little sumchin
bitch , you know i'm buzzing , bumpity bumping
packs in the back of mack's trunk and drunk and
we up yet we slumping , zombie fully function
fu - fu - fuck corruption , lies vivid as jenna's titties
terrorist experiments , america's full of shit , uh
blinded by skin color , blinded by his lover
blinded by shining lights , and you the gift of life
relax my mind 'til it's do or die
each moment's a mineral , poetry's protein
the verse is a vitamin , effects like codeine
what you gon' do when them zombies come for you
( murder , murder , murder , kill , kill , kill )
( meechy darko )
dta , i don't trust none of my homies
juice laced my spliff with pcp and never told me
passed me a cup of bleach and said meech sip on this codeine
wash it down with oe , now i'm throwed up like o.g.'s
my voice hold the beat down , it's the anchor
and my nigga stay with the metal like kurt angle
zombies blowing up like the boston marathon , boom
what , too soon ? opposite of late bloom
dunk from the free throw since i was spewed from the womb
survival of the fittest , i ate my twin in the womb
and due to robin givens , i may never jump the broom
and while you pay for pussy i was out in paid dues
stage diving turned a couple thousand people to my pool
you a fool if you think i ain't on the move
i am it , i am new , i exude
but cannot be reproduced , execute for my grimy and my destitute
( the architect )
spit in your face at the pearly gates
at twenty - four a nigga special like he thirty - eight
the limerick i kick is four finger ring shit
i twist a motherfucker limbs up like a green spliff
defying odds
no fa√ßade , man my city like oz
so with this tree of weed i'm never tryna be the prize
rap , produce , half a muse when i scribe thought
a quiet man , so if i can't stand then i'ma fall
i'd rather be a failure than never mentioned at all
the dimensions of the mind measure crime like yellow tape
music the bass , swap my heart for an 808
you outta shape , smoking great good god , like j.r
nostrils filled with the potency of smoking kief
all the windows down so you know it's me
bow down , my radiator hiss like my amy wine vinyl , for now
