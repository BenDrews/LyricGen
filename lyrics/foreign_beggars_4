set it off ( set it off ) , set it up
you're at the front line , prone , and you're getting crushed
ready to bust , mind blown when you think of us
about to turn your bloodline cold when we interrupt
yeah , transmitting live from the apex
we got the reelfire shit for your tape decks
we bring the heat something messy like a splayed chest
fully automatic how we sprayinâ€™ fam we staying blessed
we straight devil with the face set
levelling the game makes you heavy like a bayonet
i keep it patient like i'm playing chess
even though we barely keep on slaving like away a debt
we breaking necks like the world series
other rappers sweating bullets as i burn millies
i keep it gully while i'm running for my life blood
every minute waiting is a minute i can earn silly
and i ain't talking about cash flow
i'd par your swag in a flash if i was mad broke
it's foreign beggars , stepping up to the plate
while they destined to be spending oblivion in a black hole
you don't wanna fuck with me
no , you don't wanna fuck with me
wa - wanna with me
no - no , you don't wanna with me
raw , the manor how we came as a team
whole stees go against the grain of the scene
the jagged - edge flow cuts deep like a serrated blade
sawing through your industry doors come on we're crazy cray
we're at the midnight hour , causing upheaval
silhouettes in the black light , i still see you
emerging out of the depths , it's brought that gutter sound
full speed , leading the wolf pack across the town
it's foreign beggars yeah , showing no teeth
we roll so deep of that agent o speech
spitting projectiles flows the 'go go' scene
my big red button destroys the whole globe reach
that's the motif , so sleek , mo' heat
ink stains blot out the sun when they soak sheets
it's that gully grip live off the mothership
only one question to ask , you wanna fuck with this ?
