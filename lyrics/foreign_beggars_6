it's going down like that
b - believe it
i lost my way home while exploring the galaxy
when i chill i'm talking glacial
lace any break with an understated skill
make it feel like you're in an fabricated reel
like spending hours taking pills
welcome to my animated film
journeys through stainless steel
my will'll cut sharper than any sabre will
we're bubbling like soda - streams
syntax coming fresher than pot - pourri
popping up on the set like 'only me'
here's my persona super - imposed on beats
notice we get colder than frozen cream
or hotter than the haze off a solar beam
all over beats dag made
trying to find a niche in this rap game
gotta be a weasel in this rat race
ain't pulling blades but i may pull a face
my trade's putting haters in their place
so get a tape
nah , fuck that it's all digital
i'm getting more gripping than four fingers will
trying to stop your breath it's
mr vulgatron and the dr s
yo it's dr syntax
( orifice )
dropping sick raps
( never dis )
what we dispatch
( you'll get bitch slapped )
we got the killer raps , no filler , you should consider this
the iller kids spitting it's sicker than fifty invalids
dropping sick raps
sit back with dr syntax
sunday afternoon got my mind set on six tracks
it's kind of nice to exist in the here and now
reeling out rhymes with people nice enough to hear me out
i feel no fear when the beat be bumping in the speaker
i see the mic and start fiending like an eager beaver
i guess i'm in the right place at the right time
cos all i wanna do in life is recite rhymes
it's been a long time coming but i guess i'm ready
ready for the radio shows and features on the telly
sometimes i find myself lost from the word go
but then i kick back and reminisce about my first show
it's been a mission but i'm glad i went the long way
even though i ripped at every rave and got the wrong pay
paid my own trains , slept in parks after long days
but now i know i feel it in my heart when my song plays
i leave my prints on
every single beat that i'm given
ever the originator give or take a little nod to convention
feeling part of the scene more than ever
now me and tron put our heads together now to develop plans
think we bless mics , well you guessed right
metaphorical facial lies for your stress lines
your best life kinda lost hope at the age of twenty
never tended to his head instead he he lost it dropping one too many
sedatives , and anything anyone ever said was heavy
choking on his pubes made him sound like he was general levy
you know you only really get one chance to shine
one chance to show the world you're first and burst rhymes
don't matter that you came in last your first time
but you better come in first the last time you rhyme
it's going down like that
