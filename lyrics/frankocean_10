a tornado flew around my room before you came
excuse the mess it made , it usually doesn't rain in southern california , much like arizona
my eyes don't shed tears , but boy , they pour when
i'm thinkin' 'bout you ( ooh no , no , no )
i've been thinkin' bout you ( you know , know , know )
i've been thinkin' bout you , do you think about me still ?
do ya , do ya ?
or do you not think so far ahead
cause i been thinkin' bout forever , ooh
or do you not think so far ahead
cause i been thinkin' bout forever , ooh
no , i don't like you , i just thought you were cool enough to kick it
got a beach house i could sell you in idaho
since you think i don't love you , i just thought you were cute , that's why i kissed you
got a fighter jet , i don't get to fly it though , i'm lying down
thinkin' 'bout you ( ooh no , no , no )
i've been thinkin' bout you ( you know , know , know )
i've been thinkin' bout you , do you think about me still ?
do ya , do ya ?
or do you not think so far ahead
cause i been thinkin' bout forever , ooh
or do you not think so far ahead
cause i been thinkin' bout forever , ooh
yes of course i remember , how could i forget how you feel ?
you know you were my first time , a new feel
it will never get old , not in my soul , not in my spirit , keep it alive
we'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white
or do you not think so far ahead
cause i been thinkin' bout forever , ooh
or do you not think so far ahead
cause i been thinkin' bout forever , ooh
