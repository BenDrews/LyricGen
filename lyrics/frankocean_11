and the peaches and the mangos
that you could sell for me
what do you think my brain is made for
is it just a container for the mind ?
this great grey matter
sensei replied , " what is your woman ?
is she just a container for the child ? "
that soft pink matter
cotton candy , majin buu , oh , oh
close my eyes and fall into you
my god , she’s giving me pleasure
what if the sky and the stars are for show
and the aliens are watching live
from the purple matter ?
sensei went quiet then violent
and we sparred until we both grew tired
nothing mattered
cotton candy , majin buu , oh , oh
dim the lights and fall into you , you , you
my god , giving me pleasure
pleasure , pleasure , pleasure
pleasure over matter
since you been gone , i been having withdrawals
you were such a habit to call
i ain't myself at all , had to tell myself , " naw
she better with some fella with a regular job "
i didn’t wanna get her involved
by dinner mr. benjamin was sitting in awe
hopped into my car ; drove far
far’s too close and i remember my memory's no sharp
butter knife , what a life , anyway
i’m building y’all a clock , stop , what am i , hemingway ?
she had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
any of ‘em that were un - southern , not me , cousin
if models are made for modelin'
thick girls are made for cuddlin’
switch worlds and we can huddle then
who needs another friend ? i need to hold your hand
you’d need no other man , we’d flee to other lands
grey matter
blue used to be my favorite color
now i ain't got no choice
blue matter
you’re good at being bad , you’re bad at being good
for heaven’s sakes , go to hell , nah , knock on wood
you’re good at being bad , you’re bad at being good
for heaven’s sakes go to hell
knock , knock , knock , knock on wood
well frankly when that ocean so mu'fucking good
make her swab the mu'fucking wood
make her walk the mu'fucking plank
make her rob a mu'fucking bank
with no mask on and a rusty revolver
