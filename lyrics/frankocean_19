my back is breaking
my beltâ€™s too tight
my hips are shaking from left to right

i wanna see your pom poms from the stands

my fingertips and my lips
they burn from the cigarettes
forrest gump you run my mind , boy
running on my mind boy

i know you forrest
i know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
but you're so buff and so strong
i'm nervous forrest

my fingertips and my lips
they burn from the cigarettes
forrest gump you run my mind , boy
running on my mind boy

but you kept running past the end zone
oh where'd you go forrest

my fingertips and my lips
they burn from the cigarettes
forrest gump you run my mind , boy
running on my mind boy
forrest gump

( you , you , oh you , you )
