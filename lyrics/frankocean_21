pool side convo about your summer last night , oh yeah
about your summer last night
ain't give you no play , mm
could i make you shive last night ?
could i make you shy on the last night , last night ?
could we make it in ? do we have time ?
i'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
noses on a rail , little virgin wears the white
you cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life
wish i was there , wish we'd grown up on the same advice
and our time was right
keep a place for me , for me
i'll sleep between y'all , it's no thing
it's no thing , it's no thing
keep a place for me , for me
now and then you miss it , sounds make you cry
some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
i came to visit 'cause you see me like a ufo
that's like never , 'cause i made you use your self control
and you made me lose my self control , my self control
keep a place for me , for me
i'll sleep between y'all , it's no thing
keep a place for me
it's nothing , it's no thing
it's nothing , it's no thing
sometimes you'll miss it and the sound
will make you cry
and some nights you're dancing
with tears in your eyes
i , i , i
know you gotta leave , leave , leave
take down some summer time
give up , just tonight , night , night
i , i , i
know you got someone comin'
you're spitting game , know you got it
i , i , i
know you gotta leave , leave , leave
take down some summer time
give up , just tonight , night , night
i , i , i
know you got someone comin'
you're spitting game , know you got it
( nobody else , nobody else )
i , i , i
know you gotta leave , leave , leave
take down some summer time
give up , just tonight , night , night
i , i , i
know you got someone comin'
you're spitting game , know you got it
