hand me a towel i'm dirty dancing by myself
gone off tabs of that acid
form me a circle , watch my jagger
might lose my jacket and hit a solo
one time
we too loud in public , them police turned down the function
now we outside and the timing's perfect
forgot to tell you , gotta tell you how much i vibe with you
and we don't gotta be solo
now stay away from highways
my eyes like them red lights
right now i prefer yellow
redbone , so mellow
fuck 'round , be cutting you
think we were better off solo
i got that act right in the windy city that night
no trees to blow through
but blow me and i owe you
two grams when the sun rise
smoking good , rolling solo
solo , solo
solo , solo
s - solo , solo
s - solo , solo
it's hell on earth and the city's on fire
inhale , inhale there's heaven
there's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
inhale , in hell there's heaven
oh , oh , oh , oh
oh , oh , oh , oh
solo , solo
solo , solo
i'm skipping showers and switching socks , sleeping good and long
bones feeling dense as fuck , wish a nigga would cross
and catch a solo , on time
white leaf on my boxers , green leaf turn to vapors for the low
and that mean cheap , 'cause ain't shit free and i know it
even love ain't , 'cause this nut cost , that clinic killed my soul
but you gotta hit the pussy raw though
now your baby momma ain't so vicious , all she want is her picket fence
and you protest and you picket sign , but them courts won't side with you
won't let you fly solo
i wanted that act right in colorado that night
i brought trees to blow through , but it's just me and no you
stayed up 'til my phone died , smoking big , rolling solo
it's hell on earth and the city's on fire
inhale , inhale there's heaven
there's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
inhale , in hell there's heaven
oh , oh , oh , oh
oh , oh , oh , oh
solo , solo
solo , solo
by myself
solo , solo
solo , solo
( by myself , by myself )
solo , solo
solo , solo
