my guy pretty like a girl
and he got fight stories to tell
i see both sides like chanel
see on both sides like chanel
swimmin' laps through pool water
heated like i'm underworld
hide my tattoos in shibuya
police think i'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he 12
how you lookin' up to me and talkin' down ?
can't you see i am the big man ?
god level i am the i am ( whoa )
now film it with that drone cam
in the pink like killa cam
put a zoom on that stick ; no√©
up so close i'm on that kill
remote controller on your lower back
yes , the good
dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
rollin' when you ride , poppin'
rollin' when you ride , ride the rodman
got one that's straight actin'
turnt out like some dirty plastic ( ride )
2016 burnt some discs
2017 ideas playin' off a walkman
this a cult , not a clique on the net
with a cup in a cup , actavis
that's a double edge , " issa knife "
and i don't like to fight 'til i'm fightin'
revenge in the air make my lungs sick
chopper in the sky like a gun trick
clips on clips like mike
it's really all
i see both sides like chanel
see on both sides like chanel
it's really you on my mind
it's really you on my mind
it's really you
it's really you on my mind
v both sides of the 12
steam both sides of the l
freeze smoke rings and they hail
sleet snow grind for the wealth
whole team diamonds is real
showed 'em how to shine by theyselves
you need a cosign for your health
i need that bitch to grind on my belt
i know you need to try for my belt
i know you seen it drivin' itself
no matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
but it's stealth
i see both sides like chanel
i see both sides like chanel
my pockets snug
they can't hold my 7
they banned my visa
my amex and mastercards
i got new money
and it's all cash
i got new bags
and they all collabs
i rubber band a bunch of thousand dollar delta gift cards
( i need my baby boy )
amazin' the cash online unknown
( i need my baby boy )
blazin' the dash , countin' money at home
my pockets snug
they can't hold my 7
they banned my visa
my amex and mastercards
i got new money
and it's all cash
i got new bags
and they all collabs
i rubber band a bunch of thousand dollar delta gift cards
( i need my baby boy )
amazin' the cash online unknown
( i need my baby boy )
blazin' the dash , countin' money at home
