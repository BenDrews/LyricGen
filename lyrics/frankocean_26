the best song wasn't the single , but you weren't either
livin' in ladera heights , the black beverly hills
domesticated paradise , palm trees and pools
the water's blue , swallow the pill
keepin' it surreal , whatever you like
whatever feels good , whatever takes you mountain high
keepin' it surreal , not sugar - free
my tv ain't hd , that's too real
grapevine , mango , peaches , and limes , the sweet life
the sweet life , sweet life
sweet life , sweet life
the sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet life
sweet life , the sweet life
sweetie pie
you've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
the starshine always kept you warm
so why see the world , when you got the beach
don't know why see the world , when you got the beach
the sweet life
the best song wasn't the single , but you couldn't turn your radio down
satellite need a receiver , can't seem to turn the signal fully off
transmitting the waves
you're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
but you're keepin' it surreal , whatever you like
whatever feels good , whatever takes you mountain high
keepin' it surreal , not sugar - free , my tv ain't hd , that's too real
grapevines , mango , peaches , and lime , a sweet life
a sweet life
a sweet life , yeah
a sweet life , a sweet life
a sweet life
live and die in the life
you've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
the starshine always kept you warm
so why see the world , when you got the beach
don't know why see the world , when you got the beach
the sweet life
and the water , is exactly what i wanted
it's everything i thought it would be ( thought it would be )
but this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
the neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy
you've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
the starshine always kept you warm
so why see the world , when you got the beach
don't know why see the world , when you got the beach
the sweet life
