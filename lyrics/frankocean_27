bad luck to talk on these rides
mine on the road
your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
white ferrari
had a good time
sweet 16 , how was i supposed to know anything ?
i let you out at central
i didn't care to state the plain
kept my mouth closed
we're both so familiar
white ferrari
stick by me
close by me
you were fine
you were fine here
that's just a slow body
you left when i forgot to speak
so i text the speech , lesser speeds
texas speed , yes
basic takes its toll on me
'ventually , 'ventually , yes
ah on me 'ventually , 'ventually , yes
i care for you still and i will forever
that was my part of the deal , honest
we got so familiar
spending each day of the year , white ferrari
good times
in this life , life
in this life , life
one too many years
some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
mind over matter is magic
i do magic
if you think about it it'll be over in no time
and that's life
ooh , oooh , oooh , ooh
i'm sure we're taller in another dimension
you say we're small and not worth the mention
youâ€™re tired of movin' , your body's achin'
we could vacay , there's places to go
clearly this isn't all that there is
can't take what's been given
but we're so okay here , we're doing fine
primal and naked
you dream of walls that hold us imprisoned
it's just a skull , least that's what they call it
and we're free to roam
