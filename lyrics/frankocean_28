we once had things in common
now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
ice cold , baby , i told you , i'm ice cold ( ice cold ! )
you out here flyin' high ( high ! )
go head , fly that thing !
high ! high !
but fly alone
you always smokin' in the house
what if my mother comes over ?
you can't get up and get a job
cause this little hustle's getting you by
you're the dealer and the stoner with the sweetest kiss i've ever known
i know what i was on , i had a pilot jones
she took me high , then she took me home
pilot jones , pilot jones
tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again
i just don't know why i keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober
see there you go reachin' up your blouse and no i don't want a child
but i ain't been touched in a while by the dealer
and the stoner with the sweetest kiss i've ever known
i know what i was on , i had a pilot jones
she took me high , then she took me home
pilot jones , pilot jones
in the sky up above , the birds
i saw the sky like i never seen before
you thought i was above you
above this in so many ways
but if i got a condo on a cloud
then i guess you can stay at my place
i'mma get one
i need ya
admit it
you're my pilot jones
