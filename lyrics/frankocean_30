aye , aye , so now i'm—
so low that i can see under the skirt of an ant
so low that i don't get high no more
when i " geronimo ! " , i just go " eh "
solo , my cup is a rojo , my cholo , my friend
so low that i can admit
when i hear that another kid is shot by the popo
it ain't an event no more
so low that no more high horses , so hard to wear polo
when i do , i cut the pony off
now there's a hole that once was a logo , how fitting
so low that i can give a fuck about what is trending
tryna cut down on my spending
regardless of winning , instead of pretending
and bending over backwards
over half of these hoes had work done
sayin' they want something real from a man
just saying it , we being real persons
i hate that it's like this , i feel for you , ant
i don't know what it's like with a skirt on
so pardon me if i am being insensitive
but darling this only worsens
so low my halo stay way low , it feels like it's bent
so low that when they throw pussy or pesos
i don't pay no attention to it
so low that i am no rookie but feel like a kid
lookin' at the other kids
with astonishment while i'm on punishment
watchin' the summer come close to an end
after 20 years in , i'm so naïve
i was under the impression
that everyone wrote they own verses
it's comin' back different and , yeah , that shit hurts me
i'm hummin' and whistlin' to those not deserving
i've stumbled and lived every word
was i working just way too hard ?
