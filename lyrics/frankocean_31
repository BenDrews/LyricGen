the markings on your surface
your speckled face
flawed crystals hang from your ears
i couldn't gauge your fears
i can't relate to my pierce
i'd rather live outside
i'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
maybe i'm a fool

i'm living over city
and taking in the homeless sometimes
been living in an idea
an idea from another man's mind

a moment one solar flare we're consumed
so why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life ?
high flights , inhale the vapor , exhale once and think twice
eat some shrooms , maybe have a good cry about you
see some colors , light hang glide off the moon
