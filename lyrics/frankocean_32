you don't know how little you matter until you're all alone
in the middle of arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
used to date a blonde , you used to hit it raw
cause she was and you are madly involved , madly involved
hittin' stones in glass homes
you're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
you hit them stones and broke your home
crack rock , crack rock , crack rock , crack rock
hittin' stones in glass homes
you're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
you hit them stones and broke your home
crack rock , crack rock , crack rock , crack rock
you're shuckin' and jivin' , stealin' and robbin'
to get the fixing that you're itching for
your family stopped inviting you to things
won't let you hold their infant
you used to to get a little cut - up from time to time
but the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky
hittin' stones in glass homes
you're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
you hit them stones and broke your home
crack rock , crack rock , crack rock , crack rock
crooked cop , dead cop , how much dope can you push to me
crooked cop , dead cop , no good for community
fuckin' pig get shot , three hundred men will search for me
my brother get popped and don't no one hear the sound
don't no one hear the rounds ( sound )
don't no one hear the shells ( shells )
don't no one hear a sound
don't no one disturb the peace for riot
don't no one disrupt nirvana
don't no one wanna blow the high
crack rock , crack rock , crack rock
how you feeling girl ?
how's the gutter doing ?
crack rock
