( we're was spendin' too much time alone )
spendin' too much time alone
( and i just ran outta trojans )
horses gallop to her throne
( we're behaving like teenagers )
we're behaving like teenagers
( making less than minimum wage )
still inside our parents' homes
( no i don't live in denver )
no i don't live in denver
( i grew up in sierra leone )
and her pink skies will keep me warm
sierra leone
sierra leone
tid bits of intuition that i be gettin' abandon mission ( sierra leone )
abandon mission , you must be kiddin' , this shit feelin' different
shit feelin' too good to me
glistening , shimmerin' underneath the sunlight , the sunlight ( sierra leone )
and a new day will bring about the dawn
and a new day will bring another crying babe into the world ( girl now )
our daughter's reaching for your nipple cause it's time for her to eat
tonight i'll lay her in the cradle if it's time for go to sleep
i'll sing a lennon lullaby , she can have a pretty dream
baby girl if you knew what i know , knew what i know
na , na na , na na , na...
na , na na , na na , na...
