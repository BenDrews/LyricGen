she singing bitch i'm paid , that's all i gotta say , i'm like who knew ?
that after all the years i'd make a weezy fan out of you too
when i met you , you were thom yorke , chris martin and u2
when you met me i was three 6 , pimp c , bun b , 8 - ball and mjg , yeah
but we're both a long way from home
we got the windows down , the radio's on , always
i wrote a letter to the sky saying maybe one day you'll get to kiss me
my girl found it in the car and said baby why you trying to diss me ?
cause you know you're my baby , you know you're my baby , ooh
i'm not just in it for the pride , in it for the ride , yeah
you said one day i'll start up my car and it'll explode
well now that's the last time i'm letting you watch casino alone
you hate when i leave you in the motel and hunt for jobs
so now i let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot
i know we're both a long way from home
just keep the windows down and radio's on , always
i wrote a letter to the sky saying maybe one day you'll get to kiss me
my girl found it in the car and said baby why you trying to diss me ?
don't you know you're my baby , don't you know you're my baby , ooh
i'm not just in it for the ride , in it for the ride , yeah
you'll live a better life
a better life you'll know
a dull life ain't nothing
don't speak put your car in drive and
no benz can make you friends , she don't care what car i'm driving
no bentley can kiss me back
