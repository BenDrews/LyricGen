american love , american me , american you
american tear , american heartbreak , oh , oh , oh
i took a walk with the palm trees as the daylight fell
sangria in a canteen , talking to myself ( i can't remember )
this tattoo on my left hand is turning purple - ish blue
daydreams of the romance , daydreams of you
my pretty woman in a ballgown , i'm richard gere in a tux
getting married in a courthouse , writing vows in a rush
making out before the judge with my teenage wife
got a wedding band done that i just might die with
it's an american wedding
they don't mean too much , but we were so in love
we had an american wedding
now what's mine is yours , that's american law
m - r - s dot kennedy , she signed her name in pen
in a fancy , fancy cursive , then turned her term papers in
a thesis on islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
hijabs and polygamist husbands , those poor un - american girls
after school she ran to me , jumped in my 5.0
this is the home of the brave , land of the free , but your parents still didn't know
she said , " i've had a hell of a summer , so , baby , don't take this hard
but maybe we should get an annulment , before this goes way too far "
it's just an american wedding
they don't mean too much , they don't last enough
we had an american wedding
now what's mine is yours , american divorce
well , you can have my mustang , that's all i've got in my name
but jesus christ , don't break my heart , this wedding ring won't ever wipe off
but if you stay , oh , if you stay
you'll probably leave later anyway , it's love made in the usa
don't let 'em front you to saying you can't move
without 'em , fuck 'em , i tell 'em this ain't new
we been some hustlers since it began , dude
ain't gon' be tripping over some bitch - ass , dude
they so vain , i tell 'em this ain't you
you can get sensitive but the shit ain't true
these niggas can't do nothing that i can't do
that she can't do , that he can't do , that you can't do , that we can't do
man , i had a dream and then the shit came true
and nigga , if i did it , i think you can too
these niggas can't do nothing that i can't do
that she can't do , that he can't do , that you can't do , that we can't do
man , i had a dream and then the shit came true
these niggas can't do nothing that i can't do
that she can't do , that he can't do , that you can't do
