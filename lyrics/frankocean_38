" end "
darker times
they’re telling boulder heavy lies
looks like all we’ve got is each other
the truth is obsolete
remember when all i had was my mother
she didn’t compromise
she could recognize
voodoo
our daughters and our sons
are just candles in the sun
voodoo
don’t let him see divide
don’t you let her see divide
voodoo
she’s got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
he’s got the whole wide world in his pants
he wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
then put the whole wide world on her hands
she’s got the whole wide world in her hands
he’s got the whole wide world in his hands
there's somethin' about you
i can't believe i'm even talking to you , tellin' you this right now
you're special
i wish you could see what i see
" golden girl "
she peels an orange for us in the morning
she woke me up to give me half
i can hear the children soccer ballin'
like wildcats running on the grass , hey
you're a girl on this island
i'm a boy from america
my flight leaves tonight , but i don't think i'm going backwards
i won't be going backwards
you're my golden girl
you're the one i've chosen , girl
you're 24k
you make it bright when it's grey
you're my golden girl
the sun has been kind to you
you're 24k ( girl )
but the sky's never grey ( never grey )
silent moments , meditative poses
you break my focus , you make me laugh
two mopeds racing through the forest
making dirt clouds on a path , on a path
i'm my best on this island
i'm a mess in america
my flight left last night , but i know i'm not going back home , yeah
i'm not going back home , no
you're my golden girl
you're the one i've chosen , girl
you're 24k
you make it bright when it's grey
you're my golden girl
the sun has been kind to you
you're 24k ( girl )
but the sky's never grey ( never grey )
if we build a house in paradise , will we get to heaven still ?
if we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
i'mma stay right here , with you
til the hurricane comes , 'til the tsunami comes , i've found my gold
you're my golden girl
you're the one i've chosen , girl
you're 24k
you make it bright when it's grey
you're my golden girl
the sun has been kind to you
you're 24k ( girl )
but the sky's never grey ( never grey )
um , you're my g - o l - d e - n g - i r - l
and that's for the females that can't spell , but
thanks for fucking with me
you turn my dark into light , you're like a bucket of bleach
you see , i want you to know that
my negatives at home aren't working for my kodak
so that means that i don't want to go back
just know that i would like to stay here and hold that
hand of yours , girl i'm a wreck in america
your face is the best cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
and you're golden , uh , your eyes open , fuck it
let's toast and listen to michael bolton
i free - fall off the hill again
let's see where i land , i'm like gilligan
um , i trust you , golden , for wed ring
i'm just hopin' that you don't turn my neck green
