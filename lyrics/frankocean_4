taxi driver
be my shrink for the hour
leave the meter running
it's rush hour
so take the streets if you wanna
just outrun the demons , could you
he said " allahu akbar "
i told him , " don't curse me "
" bo bo , you need prayer "
i guess it couldn't hurt me
if it brings me to my knees
it's a bad religion
this unrequited love
to me it's nothing but a one - man cult
and cyanide in my styrofoam cup
i can never make him love me
never make him love me
love me
love me
love me
love me
love me
love me
love me
love me
love me
love
taxi driver
i swear i've got three lives
balanced on my head like steak knives
i can't tell you the truth about my disguise
i can't trust no one
and you say " allahu akbar "
i told him , " don't curse me "
" bo bo , you need prayer "
i guess it couldn't hurt me
if it brings me to my knees
it's a bad religion
unrequited love
to me it's nothing but a one - man cult
and cyanide in my styrofoam cup
i can never make him love me
never make him love me
love
love
it's a , it's a bad religion
to be in love with someone
who could never love you
only bad , only bad religion
could have me feeling the way i do
