slammin' , half a thang of heroin in the bathroom
keep an ak and the backup , in the backroom
cook a meal clean and she suck me like a vacuum
took a vacation to the county , i'll be back soon
sent a couple zeroes , money on my j pay
payin' off the cos , smokin' on the gateway
word around the block , when i was locked she gave my thang away
'bout to have a baby with a nigga , that's what they say
damn , well please say it ain't so
took off the glove , say it's love , when it ain't though
her classmate was comin' over , that was strange though
apparently the homework ain't all he came for
maybe you's a stank ho , maybe that's a bit mean
maybe you grew up and i'm still living like i'm sixteen
like a child running wild in these sick streets
man , i put that bitch up on her feet , she cut a nigga deep
damn , bitch , that's why i treat these hoes the way i treat them
that's deeper than a motherfucker , baby
you know what i'm saying ?
slammin' , smack it up and flip it , then i rub it down
zip it up and then i ship it to another town
smoking hella weed while me and willie bust a couple pounds
she used to like that type of shit , now we don't fuck around
girl , you used to say them other niggas wasn't hood enough
got your lil degree , now niggas from the hood ain't good enough
bitch , you wasn't trippin' when that old school was pullin' up
you was short on mids at your college , who would put them up ?
well , bitch , i'm out here puttin' on
i hope you feel the pain i'm feelin' when you hear this song
don't want a nigga that's gon' slang shit up in your home
but you ran off and got engaged , man , that shit was wrong
all to a nigga that don't got nothin' that i ain't got
only difference is he tryna be a fuckin' astronaut
saw this pussy nigga when i walked up in the barber shop
green as a leaf , lookin' sweet , that cut a nigga deep
damn , so these the type of niggas you fuck with now , baby ?
you know what i'm saying ?
square ass motherfucker , you used to love a thug nigga
i love her and she love him , so i never touch him
she's got his baby in the oven , so it's motherfuck him
ain't trippin' cause you got a nigga , i just think you rushin'
but leavin' him to be with me ain't part of our discussion
plus i'm on the road now , different color hoes now
laid back on the dope , i'm getting dollars off my shows now
bitches wanna tie me down , but i ain't in that mode now
five years later , why you calling up my phone now ?
uh , well , bitch , how you get the number ?
like every other month i'm switching up that motherfucker
back on the bus , i used to fingerfuck her singing usher
down on my luck and then she up and left me for a sucker
i reminisce on all the crazy shit we did
" you and me forever , " shit we'd say when we was kids
she said " i'm havin' problems and i pray that he forgive "
when he find out the baby ain't his , that cut a nigga deep
damn , what the fuck ? so , what you tryna say , baby ?
baby ain't his , whose is it ?
