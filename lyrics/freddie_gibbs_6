ready to kick your ass out of the world
remember everybody ain't loyal
you soft as gelatin , sick of telling them , nigga show 'em
it's coca in the pot , nigga drop it and let it boil
goofy niggas make me nervous , ain't serve 'em if i ain't know 'em
eastside , sleeping in my dope house clothes
run down pair of jordans and some dirty girbauds
sucker coming with a short , he get extorted , exposed
nigga stand on my own two balls , my dick and ten toes
straight to the tippy top
hear this nigga spitting it , whether i got a hit or not
i hit it with the whip , they notice it when they hit the rock
i'm just a cocaina chemist
cooking , chopping and cutting , you'll die if i push a button
niggas heard of me , now all of a sudden they back to thugging
if i never sell a record might catch me hot water juggin'
the d.a. want me gone , say i'm detriment to the public
took his daughter , put this dick in her butt
and said " how you love it , bitch ? ''
remember everybody ain't loyal
cause all the real niggas in jail or deep in the soil
dancing with the devil or eating a feast with the lord
gotta spit it how i live it , i beat the street and report , nigga
all the real niggas either in jail or deep in the soil , nigga
the world ain't big enough for both of us
batter up , now you pussy niggas getting fucked
straight raw with infection , passing no prophylactic
eastside , anybody killa , my niggas active
smoking and breaking a 7 up in a 6 - 5 - 0
babyface gangsta i been slanging , banging since 9 - 4
i thought the world was at my feet when i linked up with snow
but i refuse to be his flunkie , so we don't kick it no mo'
straight to the facts , nigga
i looked up to you , put that on my momma
signed a deal with you and never asked you for a dollar
cause i was down with cte , plus i was getting cheese
i played my fuck ass contract , what the lick read ?
thought i'd say this shit cause you ain't man enough to come discuss it
you wanna be jay - z ? nigga you just a fucking puppet
gary boys ain't 'bout talkin' , so bitch i had to show ya
don't make me expose you to those that don't know ya
man you said you the realest nigga in this motherfucker , check it
but ross had you scared to drop a diss record
no nuts , got the whole team looking weak
guess that's why they ran up on you at the bet
l.a. red carpet , yeah , i was geeked
you couldn't take security , so we ain't take a seat
i played the fool before , but yo a ho i'll never be
they searched that tour bus in milwaukee , had that .44 with me
esgn and to the end , i feed the killers
pray the lord'll take my breath before i be like this monkey nigga
just a whole lot of rapping , but no motherfucking action
seen gucci by himself while we was 30 deep at magic
and you didn't bust a grape , was shook from the gate
it make it seem to me the gangsta shit you kick be fake
cause all my enemies , i put them suckers in their place
so take them shades up off your eyes , and look me in my fucking face
cause i'm a motherfucking rare breed
the last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again
don't reproduce nothin' but evil seeds
i'm rapping and trapping and still ducking these f - e - d's
but bmf was sticking you for your fucking cheese
and yeah i know you sold the blow and whipped the hard
but underneath the fucking money you's a fucking mark
take heed to my statements , because they might throw you
don't make me expose you to those who don't know you
bitch
