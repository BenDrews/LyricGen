montana
it be hard to watch the cash when the bands keep droppin'
got the big 40 on me so my pants keep fallin'
it be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
and i ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
she ain't tryna be a freak but them bands keep poppin'
still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
it be hard to understand me , my jaw keep lockin'
it be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
bite down , bite down
it be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
bite down , bite down
it be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'

it be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
and i ain't even tryna talk 'cause my jaw keep lockin'

still caught up in the streets and the feds still knockin'
it be hard to understand me my jaw keep lockin'
it be hard to understand me 'cause my jaw keep lockin'
