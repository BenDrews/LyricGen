all these bitches hate you
this is something i know
because youâ€™re real enough to give it up
there ain't nothing wrong with groupie love
you're the only one i notice
it's really hard for me to focus , yeah
cuz my body so numb
all i do is kill pain
all i do is smoke loud
put you niggas to shame
i be rolling all day , mix it in the champagne
and these bottles all free , not a single drink paid
because they want me , they want me in their club
but if you got the numbers i'll be glad to show you love
cuz baby , i'm an xo nigga coming up
every time they play my song i'mma fill another cup
cuz i'm down for whatever i can always keep it up
all i need is some liquor just to keep a nigga up
i'm gifted when i'm faded
i'm faded all the time
because i know that's when they love me
they love me when i'm high
when they love me
i get money , i get money , i get money
when they love me
i get money , i get money , i get money
i'm gifted when i'm faded
i'm faded all the time
because i know that's when they love me
they love me when i'm high
when they love me
i get money , i get money , i get money
when they love me
i get money , i get money , i get money
i be gifted when i'm faded , faded all the time
thought they loved me when i made it
niggas hated all the time , it's a dirty game
try to find a bitch , maybe get married
that's like pissin' in a freezer , trying to make canaries
hawk vision , la heels right on puff terrace
making wishes , now i'm french kissing your bitch in paris
come and find me da gianni's that's from '92
heard your spoil her ass when i bought her a number two
dipping and you know it , i be pimpin like i owe it
come and find me now , i got an army with me now
turn your brains oodles and noodles
for thinking you got a screw loose
i tighten you up , them coroners will button you up
i'm gifted when i'm faded
i'm faded all the time
because i know that's when they love me
they love me when i'm high
when they love me
i get money , i get money , i get money
when they love me
i get money , i get money , i get money
i'm gifted when i'm faded
i'm faded all the time
because i know that's when they love me
they love me when i'm high
when they love me
i get money , i get money , i get money
when they love me
i get money , i get money , i get money
