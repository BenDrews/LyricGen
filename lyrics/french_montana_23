coming from the back block , posted like the backdrop
rags to the riches , got rich and bought the ragtop
lot of homies died here , look at what the grind did
put me in the same shoes , still do what shyne did
more digits , more bitches , more riches
they don’t want no broke niggas
but don’t call them gold diggers
i don’t know , i don’t know , why i ain't get the picture ?
why cosby slipped her ?
why i fucked ‘em both when they said they sisters ?
why eazy ain’t have the magic ?
why ai never won a 'ship ?
and why god took max and chinx
and he ain’t take me when i got hit ?
i can't figure it , i can't figure it out , out
no matter how much i’ve tried
no matter how much i’ve tried
can’t lie to you , i can’t lie to you

i can’t figure it out
i can’t , i can’t lie to you , ah
i can’t , i can’t lie to you , ah
beyond pérignon , the fame , the money
the baccarat crystal that’s hanging from the ceilings above me
hearing people whisper , screaming i’m lucky but trust me
nothing come free , shawty tried to keep my son from me
or i could be delirious to take life serious
remain single forever , can’t wife nothing , period
i’m a g , i need privacy , media’s never kind to me
niggas beefing on small time things , we on a dying spree
he disrespected y’all
just like a nigga , go figure
he talking reckless , yo
i can’t accept it , yo
no matter how much i’ve tried
for the love of my people , i guess i'll let it go
i can’t figure it out
i can't figure it , i can't figure it out , out
no matter how much i’ve tried
no matter how much i’ve tried
can’t lie to you , i can’t lie to you
i can't figure it , i can't figure it out , out
uh , no matter how many times i’ve , uh
no matter how many rhymes i’ve , uh
i got it all in my mind , ah uh
i got it all in my mind , ah uh
always on my mind
eh , i can't lie to you
no matter how many times i've tried
i can’t figure it out
i can’t , i can’t lie to you , ah
