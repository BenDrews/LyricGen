fuck all that ho shit
fuck all you fuck boys
bitch , we're real hustlers
get money...
it's we the best music , bad boy , coke boyz
i got my gun on me , i tell my kids i'll never leave them lonely
fucking streets on me , death row jamaicans , murder your family
fuck what happens tonight , fuck what happens tonight
fuck what happens tonight , i've got my gun on me
it was murder she wrote , your name in blood
when the love's gone , your eyes diluted full of blood
six cars full of goons , six blocks heard the boom
dreadlocks , middle of june , head shots , get tombed
stone , ten shots , five gone , 9/11 dial tone
you want it all , die alone
a war's going on nobody's safe from
now we're talking to the judge when your day come
like it was hard not to kill these niggas
it was like a full - time job not to kill these niggas
eight figures , need the eight story mansion
while i'm strapped up two - stepping with the devil dancing
diluted with blood in my eyes
like a stillborn , niggas won't make it out alive , nigga
fuck it , i'm ready to die tonight
put it on mom with that clip on my back and i loaded it twice
just a call away , my niggas is ready , no matter the price
playing with mine , you niggas could get it including your wife
isn't life a motherfucker ?
since seventeen that pistol's been my blood brother
sleeping with that lethal weapon , playing danny glover
ak40 , own a hundred if we're talking numbers
riders' fucking with mobsters
niggas want beef ? turn them to pasta
load up the clip , shoot up your mama
bang bang , bless them father
passed beside him , rest aside a lake
that's swimming with snakes inside
look at my eyes , i hate disguises
knife or gun , i compromise it
oh lord , i'm a ride on my enemies
if i die tonight , i bet them gangsters remember me
nigga , until then...
from the depths of the sea , back to the block
with a bitch on my dick and a bottle of ciroc
tick tock , non - stop , blocker , blocker , blood clot
don't test the lion cause you'll get dropped on the spot
lick shot , drip drop over the soil
pot's hot until it boils
to this crip shit , i'm loyal
dip with us , ride with us , slide with , sleep with us
sit with us , fuck with us , bad lil bitchâ€™s better get with us
she likes the french tip nails that i wear
and how i'm so pimped out with dreads in my hair , yeah
you got truth , now the truth is to dare
blue bandana , it's me and montana
at the tropicana with tanehsa , alisha , lakesha , savannah
nicknames for my blammer
the smell of blood in the bathroom
body layed out stiff full of stab wounds
i told this nigga i was coming back
pussy must not have heard when i told him that
nigga , it's eye for an eye
a life for a life , a body for a price
i want to smell his last breath took
and look him in the eyes and make for sure he knows how death looks
because i'm him , it's in the air , i can feel it
shot him four times with the gun i was concealing
overkilling , it ain't no coming back from it
then walked away with a demeanour like i just done it
something evil this way's coming
for big face hundreds this bitch gets punished
