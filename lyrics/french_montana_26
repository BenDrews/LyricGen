penning these lyrics from a hammock
with an ounce of kush , a pack of bamboos
and an ice cream sandwich , i'm that dude
game given to you from an og point of view
usually i'll sell it , but i got enough to share with you
baby , if you cook and roll that weed , i'll be so happy with you
fuck you so good , you'll know i'm cheating , it won't matter to you
you know how daddy do you , spitta make them jet maneuvers
hop out the club , don't park valet , won't get a chance to move it
i'm out before i hear the music , that's how quick them hoes be choosing
i don't call it , pussy be crawling to me
homeboy , i don't know who did what , cause i was in the cut
rolling tropical , sitting low as possible
relaxed in the sun , low as possible
relaxed in the sun , low as possible
relaxed in the sun , low as possible
relaxed in the sun , low as possible
( sample : without any sun , lotus blossom don't cry )
shorty pussy be the meanest , i be balling all arenas
homie high somewhere in venus , i mean this
when i tell you that i want it , i don't need it
they be nulling the procedures , shorty yelling from the bleachers
got me reaching like a two guard , too hard , ski mask or a suit on
five chains , canaries help me cool off , tuned off
camaro like larry flynt , block - star , rockstar
montana aerosmith , forty spit
homie niggas dying , i'll be flying out
feds on my nigga's tail , he hiding out , montana sliding out
baby , don't be fucking with my high , suck a nigga dry
i'll be low as possible , trying to clear my mind
montana , bitch
relaxed in the sun , low as possible
relaxed in the sun , low as possible
relaxed in the sun , low as possible
relaxed in the sun , low as possible
