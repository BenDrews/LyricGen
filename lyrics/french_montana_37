all we do is flex
on that steroids , bitch watch that money stretch
never knew nothin' , i'm stuntin' cause i'm on
pilot turned around and he asked me where i'm goin'
i told him
fuck away from these niggas , fuck away from these hoes
fuck away from these niggas , fuck away from these hoes
i told him
fuck away from these niggas , fuck away from these hoes
fuck away from these niggas , fuck away from these hoes
i told him
fuck away from these niggas , fuck away from these hoes
i be gone off that liquor , i would've made about eight figures
got my main bitch , my top back , my good badge i got that
i want that i cop that , my money good i don't hide that
got grip on my lap and my roof on my back
ride , strapped from the east to the
west side
clear port my lear' , fuck boys out there
spendin' stash like huh , on these drawers i wear
in them cars i don't test drive , a strap by my bedside
i dump off like bedtime , broads i get head shine
straight off top , my dog lick off shot
talkin' chopper sound nigga , lift up a whole block
counting cash sound like the sweetest song i ever heard
i ain't talk about no cars , i ain't talk about no kilos
where i'm from just dope fiends , no motherfuckin' heroes
my shades up , my tints up , my toes down , my heads up
i ain't never pulled my legs up , now my team's strong my bread's up
my drug dealers , pimps , killers all up in here
chinchillas , car dealer i be all up in there
and ain't no nigga showed me how to move , had to learn though
now i'm gettin' money fast , watch niggas burn slow
coke boys we mobbin' , bad hoes be lovin'
just a bunch of young niggas thuggin' , montana
