i'd rather be realer than you
i had to make me a cot
now i called a contractor to make me a spot
i sold the dope out your house
now you come to my house , i've got dope in the couch
you know i don't fuck with no rumors
rocking red bottoms like they pumas
got these meds on me , i'ma do 'em
i take these pills and i'm having a thrill
taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
as for the xanny , i never forgot it
got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
gotta put up the cash , can't even stay in the house
cause there’s too much too hide
whip the four to a nine , gotta pay up the rent , i was too far behind
fuck i'm too out of time , fuck 'em two at a time
had to do what i had to do to get where i'm at , niggas know i ain't lying
niggas know i ain't lying
it's a lot on my mind , it's a lot on my plate
but i never complain
i was working the weight like i came out the gym
i never did train
put the girl on a train
strapped a bird on her back , now she came back with change
i just fucked your bitch in some gucci flip flops

we got purple actavis , i thought it was a drought
i just fucked your bitch in some gucci flip flops

i just took a piss and i seen codeine coming out
we got purple actavis , i thought it was a drought
i strapped the dope to your spouse
the first time i gave her an ounce
i put some free bands in her account
i told her , " bitch , can't be running your mouth
better watch what you say to these niggas
cause you already know what they 'bout "
put the game in a choke in a knot
hit that bitch while i'm choking her out
put that hook on her , now she got love in the south
i got some purp on me now
stacking these styrofoams up by the double
they done let me back in , now they know they in trouble
valet the whip by the front door
on a percocet now and i need me some more
tell me them lies that you want me to hear
i try to forget , but it's hard to forgive
take me some codeine and pop me a pill
i pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
i smoke on this blunt , i get high as i can
i float off the earth in designer
i’m working on having some manners
i’m thinking about it right now
i’m holding the cash while i pour up the lean
then i put one in the air
i just fucked your bitch in some gucci flip flops

i just took a piss and i seen codeine coming out
we got purple actavis , i thought it was a drought
