oh , it's just me , myself and i
solo ride until i die
‘cause i got me for life ( yeah )
oh , i don't need a hand to hold
even when the night is cold
i got that fire in my soul
and as far as i can see , i just need privacy
plus a whole lot of tree , fuck all this modesty
i just need space to do me
give the world what they're tryna see
a stella maxwell right beside of me
a ferrari , i'm buyin' three
a closet of saint laurent , get what i want when i want
‘cause this hunger is drivin' me , yeah
i just need to be alone , i just need to be at home
understand what i'm speakin' on
if time is money i need a loan
but regardless i'll always keep keepin' on
fuck fake friends !
we don't take l's , we just make m's
while y'all follow , we just make trends
i'm right back to work when that break ends
oh , it's just me , myself and i
solo ride until i die
‘cause i got me for life
( got me for life , yeah )
oh i don't need a hand to hold
even when the night is cold
i got that fire in my soul
i don't need anything to get me through the night
except the beat that's in my heart
yeah , it's keepin' me alive ( keeps me alive )
i don't need anything to make me satisfied ( you know )
‘cause the music does me good
and it gets me every time ( yeah )
yeah , and i don't like talkin' to strangers
so get the fuck off me , i'm anxious
i'm tryna be cool , but i may just go ape shit
say " fuck y'all ! " to all of y'all faces
it changes though now that i'm famous
everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
but i love it , the rush is amazin'
celebrate nightly and everyone rages
i found how to cope with my angers
i'm swimmin' in money
swimmin' in liquor , my liver is muddy
but it's all good , i'm still sippin' this bubbly
this shit is lovely , this shit ain't random , i didn't get lucky
made it right here ‘cause i'm sick with it , cuddy
they all take the money for granted
but don't want to work for it—tell me now , isn't it funny ?
oh , it's just me , myself and i
solo ride until i die
‘cause i got me for life
oh , i don't need a hand to hold
even when the night is cold
i got that fire in my soul
i don't need anything to get me through the night
except the beat that's in my heart
yeah , it's keepin' me alive
i don't need anything to make me satisfied
‘cause the music fills me good
and it gets me every time
like , ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba ( yeah )
ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba
‘cause the music fills me good
and it gets me every time
yeah , lonely nights i laid awake
pray to lord my soul to take
my heart's become too cold to break
know i'm great , but i'm broke as hell
havin' dreams that i'm foldin' cake
all my life i've been told to wait
but i'ma get it now , yeah , it's no debate
yeah
oh , it's just me , myself and i
solo ride until i die
‘cause i got me for life
( got me for life , yeah )
oh , i don't need a hand to hold
even when the night is cold
i got that fire in my soul
i don't need anything to get me through the night
except the beat that's in my heart
and it's keepin' me alive ( keeps me alive )
i don't need anything to make me satisfied ( you know )
‘cause the music fills me good
and it gets me every time
like , ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - ba - da - ba
ba - ba - ba - da - ba
‘cause the music fills me good
and it gets me every time
