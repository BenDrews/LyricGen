i been through like a hundred cities
signed a thousand titties , i'm talkin' millions of bitties
i'm a dog , i chase that kitty , if your girlfriend is pretty
chances are i'm tryin' to snatch so i could slay and take her with me
bro i'm the man , did you not know that ?
your girl want me to take a picture with her on her kodak
and you're so whack , she knows that
i be where the coke and smoke at
see her friend and now i'm going for that three like i'm steve novak
don't be mad at me if she leaves
you should always know not to fuck around with thieves
she just wants to kick it with some g's
smoke some trees , pop some p's , later she'll be on her knees
and i'm gone
so if you really want her for your own
be worried if i show up on her phone
you don't want to leave the two of us alone
cause i'mma probably take her somewhere soon to bone

hoodie , oh jeez , goddamn , look at all my followers
bitches ride the wagon , but i'd rather give her cholera
many look at me like i ain't even got a fuckin' plan ( fuckin plan )
alright , that's cause i'm the fuckin' man
yo girl on some romeo and juliet
cause she would rather kill herself than ever be with you again
so i swoop in and tell her , if her parents don't approve of me
that don't change a goddamn thing , girl , i don't buy no jewelry
never spendin' money on a necklace
or a bracelet , let's just face it , like you better when i'm wasted
and you like me when i'm silent , silent but i'm deadly
me and g some lady killers , let me start the medley like , hello ( hi there )
and please don't put your number in my phone ( don't do that )
cause i might text you after all of this patron ( my bad )
it tends to help me out when i'm feelin' alone
but i don't wanna go , i don't , i don't wanna go
