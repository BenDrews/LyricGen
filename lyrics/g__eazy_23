uh , and everyone's like “no , no g why'd you rap on that shit ?
and make a dumb song about acting ratchet
flip another 50's song , that’s a classic
endless summer , please go back to that shit "
ain’t shit changed , got the facts to back it
uh huh , and i don’t give a fuck if the truth be told
‘cause i been doing drugs with these groupie hoes
drunk listening to gucci throwed
last night , yeah , i found a slut
who appeared to be the type to be down to cut
she took another shot and said “turn down for what ? ”
like “i don’t know , fuck , you look like you might throw up”
silly hoes party so much these days
the monica lewinsky’s who give the bj’s
i really like your friend , call her up for three ways
this songs full of all the clichés
bulleit bourbon , i pull up swervin’
i’m the waviest , i might pull up surfing
i’m waking up , i’m hungover as fuck
i make the girl get out , but first pull the curtain
off a thizzle throw a party , all these bitches sniffle
neighbors bugging saying ‘‘please just try to keep it civil ! ’’

we brought weed , we brought bars
said “bring friends” , she was cool with that
the homie brought the whip , i hopped in front , there’s two in back
artsy girls , they just want to go to school and act
she gon’ run and tell her friends that skizzy mars is cool as shit
rapper stereotypes , but what if it happens like every night ?
i pull out my phone and i barely can type
mix the liquor , the pills and it rarely goes right , i’m like
look where we started , we used to get carded
two - stepping models at 1 oak and darby
blues by the curtain , the life of the party
she a big fan , got my mixtape on her laptop
cigarettes and henn , the city is our backdrop
her and all her friends , instagramming , taking snapshots
i got the whiskey , got the weed , hit the jackpot
