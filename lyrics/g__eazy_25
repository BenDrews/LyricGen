yeah , rappers try to brag about accomplishments
but nothing you've been dropping yet astonishes
yeah , next shit i'm about to say is obvious
but criticism's worth some more than compliments
yeah , we're living at a different speed
trying to sprout a money tree , we started out with just a seed
always working , never hindered by a little fatigue
rapping in arenas , i'm still playing in a different league
yeah , you still playing wiffle ball
dropping opportunities i'm picking up a different call
holding out for bigger checks to lift us all
never kept a safety net to catch us even if i fall
rather risk it all than play it safe
you like to sprinkle salt and player hate
my team can eat , i'll share a plate
i had the black on black , i swear you're late
everyday i got some fly shit on
keeping all black outfit on
i already bagged most the chicks
that you out here trying to get on
you just catching up to what i've been on
yeah , that's what i've been on
i see what you trying to do , that's not even kinda new
that's the shit i've been on
all these girls you see around , i already took 'em down
that's the shit i've been on
that's the shit i've been on
that's the shit i've been on
i be thinking forward though
thinking quick and making plans , y'all be thinking sort of slow
you be thinking more bitches , i be thinking more dough
showed them all i do this shit but trust me , i got more to show
yeah , yeah , i'm just getting started now
all that swerve and spill my bourbon , brody that's a party foul
rappers try to swear they're cool
really ? i'm like " hardly , pal "
black on black with hair slicked back , boy i got the hardest style
and i'm always snatching chicks , flier than aladdin's whips
haters on the sideline bitter , hella fucking mad he's rich
took your darling off your arm , now she just wanna be daddy's bitch
they can't even find me where i'm chillin' , like my addy switched
yeah , breaking rules we all bent 'em
dreaming about these m's , told my team let's all get 'em
make a classic song , last as long as raw denim
every track's a problem , what i spit is all venom
everyday i got some fly shit on
keeping all black outfit on
i already bagged most the chicks
that you out here trying to get on
you just catching up to what i've been on
yeah , that's what i've been on
i see what you trying to do , that's not even kinda new
that's the shit i've been on
all these girls you see around , i already took 'em down
that's the shit i've been on
that's the shit i've been on
that's the shit i've been on
