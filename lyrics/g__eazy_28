here's my story , it's sad but true
it's about a girl that i once knew
she took my love , then ran around
with every single guy in town
she played with my heart , made me question , if i was insane
sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins
heartbreak hotel room , 505
i was blinded by love , and the way she lied
not me , no way , but that day she fooled me
when i caught sue running around
she was running around , she was running around , she was running around
she was , she was running around
um , so i said " peace ! , " and i left it
can't get mad at me when your actions request it
couldn't even tell me to my face , had to text it
you can pack your bags , follow signs to the exit
yes , move it along please , pronto
oh , and by the way , return your keys to the condo
if you played at the apollo
you'd be the type of act that i would boo off stage
while i throw you a tomato
a tough act to follow , but you fooled me , bravo
can't believe i fell for your bull , chicago
can't believe you asked me to stay , nah , hoe
i'm outta here with rocket power , babe , otto
she played with my heart , made me question , if i was insane
sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins
heartbreak hotel room , 505
i was blinded by love , and the way she lied
not me , no way , but that day she fooled me
when i caught sue running around
she was running around , she was running around , she was running around
she was , she was running around
well , i should've known she would run around
chill for a second , then peace when the summer's down
now , how dumb i sound , ever since i fell for the apple of my eye ?
cupid always keeps his gun around
when i smash , she was like a woman from the past
a mary tyler moore with more ass
should've figured something when she let me score fast
but i was misguided , thinking she had more class
nah , i couldn't be wronger
fuck it anyways , it was time to move onward
i'm tripping no longer
put her on the streets like a banksy
'cause i was too swanky , and she was too skanky
she played with my heart , made me question , if i was insane
sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins
heartbreak hotel room , 505
i was blinded by love , and the way she lied
not me , no way , but that day she fooled me
when i caught sue running around
she was running around , she was running around , she was running around
she was , she was running around
she was running around ( hey ) , she was running around ( hey ) , she was running around
she was , she was running around
