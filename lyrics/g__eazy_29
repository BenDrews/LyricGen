these girls wanna tie a kid down and keep me around
but i would never change ; i’m a dog , i’m a hound
but i tell them what they wanna hear
they like how it sounds
till i’m gone with the wind and i’m lost , never found
i met her at my show , then we smashed right after
if we go three rounds then she'll fall in love faster
the very next morning i’m casper
in another city for a show somewhere getting plastered
it’s a disaster ; to her i’m a drug
i do her kinda dirt , but they still fall in love
and i don’t understand it , foreign chicks on me
and she speak another language like she from another planet
she struggle when i’m gone , it’s hard when i leave
being ricky pen , wear my heart on my sleeve
and she tell me that she love me but it’s hard to believe
cause i’m coming and going , then i cum then i leave
and i swear i’m really not that shady
but you can’t blame me for who i’ve met lately
nowadays chicks wanna call a kid baby
as soon as they find out i rap , shit's crazy
but i do play along , yo i can’t front
i give in to every groupie with a fat butt
london to japan , hong kong to iran
chicks say i’m the man
