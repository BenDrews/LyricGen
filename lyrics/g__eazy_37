cause i do , cause i do , cause i do
keep writing you
heart is racing hard
got you on my mind
don't ever think i don't
i know what you like
and i'm the only one that ever should
know when i cross your mind
make you wanna hit it right
right now , but don't even think about it
i could get you right , yeah
and i'm the only one that ever could
but what you should do
don't , don't , don't....
don't think i don't think about you , oh , oh
cause i do , but...
don't , don't , don't....
cause i do , cause i do , but
don't , don't , don't....
cause i do , but , don't
last night i sent a message
drunk when i sent it , pieces of a fragmented sentence
essentially along the lines of saying i'm in town
didn't cross the line , just saying if you're down
let's chill and get a drink
i sipped , hoping i would hear again
the text bubble popped up and disappeared again
like i don't want it getting weird again
and i don't wanna fight
and i don't want you shedding tears again
it's not a big deal , but don't think i don't think about you
just cause i ain't spoken about you
i'd asked how you feel but already know i won't get it out you
you'll probably tell your friends that i wrote this about you
whatever , i know i can be jealous and crazy
the voices in my head have liked to yell at me lately
i still can't believe what they've been telling me lately
sometimes i wonder if you share my sentiments , maybe
let me know
don't , don't , don't....
don't think i don't think about you , oh , oh
cause i do but
don't , don't , don't....
cause i do , cause i do , but
don't , don't , don't....
cause i do , but
don't , don't , don't....
don't think i don't think about you , oh , oh
