take me down
take me all the way down tonight , soon i'll be leaving
break me down
break me all the way down , before the night is over
( over )
let's get lost , let's get lost
let's get lost , let's get lost
what it is , what it could be ?
my imagination runs fast
only if you comin' with me
4 am staying up past
or however long these drugs last
don't know why i live so fast
they be telling me to slow down
i be screaming out " fuck that ! "
i really wanna take you down
moaning is how i wanna make you sound
can't wait until i get you home
fuck that i wanna take you now
let’s do it all - have a ball
hook up tonight in the ladies' room stall
follow you there i'll let you make the call
you can text all your friends say you'll see them tomorrow
that's if you're down
she never fucked the first night until now
let me , plow
faded , i'm drunk off the brown
stayed up all night on the town
act like tomorrow just doesn't exist
time isn't real ain't shit on my wrists
let go of everything then you have bliss
then she told me this
take me down
take me all the way down tonight
soon i'll be leaving ( i'll be leaving )
break me down
break me all the way down , before the night is over
( over )
let's get lost , let's get lost
let's get lost , let's get lost
let's get lost tonight
you can be supreme kate moss tonight
turn up in the soho loft tonight
do drugs , take 10 shots tonight
awesome i’m naked with naked and famous jeans on the floor
live a wild life , you ain't seen this before
you should give brains and i mean this for sure
that's what genius is for
beautiful girl that i just met on tour
another good girl that i'll probably destroy
her life was stable until she met me
sheltered and safe so she never gets freed
but she loves trouble she's drawn to the danger
never goes crazy , i bet i can change her
i could make her fall in love with a stranger
switch up the pace i don't mean danny granger
can’t wait until tomorrow ? i'm fine with today
you pretty as fuck and i'm tryna slay
" let's do this right now " is what i'm trying to say
i can tell you don't love him , you're dying to stray
i do not give a fuck 'bout your ex
i'm not looking for love , i'm just looking for sex
tension between us had me feeling vexed
then she sent me a text...
take me down
take me all the way down tonight , soon i'll be leaving
break me down
break me all the way down , before the night is over
let's get lost , let's get lost
let's get lost , let's get lost
that's that endless summer , never going back to school
we do what we want to , can't tell me no rules
every night on the town , going out all the time
and i'm tryna take you down , only thing on my mind
take me down
take me all the way down tonight , soon i'll be leaving
break me down
break me all the way down , before the night is over
let's get lost , let's get lost
let's get lost , let's get lost
