you're my lover , yes , you are
shining brighter than the brightest star
you turn me on so naturally
your heavenly body only i can see
people are saying , baby , you're so smart
picture your mind , it's a work of art
feeling like a frog and i wanna jump
got to do your body with the big pump
pumping it with a big pump
pumping , pumping , pumping it with a big pump " pumping by the big pump "
pumping , pumping , pumping it with a big pump
pumping , pumping , pumping it with a big pump " yeah ! ! "
you've been shooting this crossbow
it's the chance to dance and fall in love , move your torso
don't be afraid to shake that.. ( shake that ! ! ) back
move your rump to the pump track
get your back up off the wall , get with the bass that pumps
ya jumps cause you got to dig the stroke
it's no joke , cause the groove's all that
move your body , baby , cause you know it's fat
in a club after hours
doing the pump , is sure to move the wallflowers
you're up now , it's time to get down
if you got a bad foot , use the good foot like james brown
let the rhythm improve your step , swing your partner
and if you can't swing with that , it's all in the technique
but this beat's so fat , you look good with left feet
so feel the heartbeat with the bump
cause you know , you dig the big pump
pump ! ! pump ! ! pump ! ! pump ! ! pump ! ! pump ! !
good god , you dig the big pump
pump ! ! pump ! ! pump ! ! pump ! ! pump ! ! pump ! !
good god , dig the big pump
pump ! ! pump ! ! pump ! ! pump ! ! pump ! ! pump ! !
good god , break it down
if it could make you dig this philosophy
then i'd be doing better than the ones before me
i'm feeling like a frog and i need to jump
talking about doing that body up
talking about doing that body up
talking about doing that body up with the big pump
with the big pump , good god !
under a thick brick house judy with a booty that's fat
and i'll show you how to skin the cat
yeah , cause i'm digging the format
i ain't laying my game 'til i get you to the welcome mat
as we dance the horizontal
when i'm in the skins , baby , i'm hitting lotto
cause i likes to humpty hump
i'm up for the down stroke with the big pump
