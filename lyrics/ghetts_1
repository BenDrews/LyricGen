tell my man i'm a general , he ain't even second in command
tell a man , tell another man , tell the next man , tell em wah gwan
i'm going on like i ain't ever read a psalm
ready or not , weapon in my palm , setting off alarms , so road that i'm never in my yard
i've got a new ting , rip an enemy apart
just setting apart , never's on my mast , devil in my path
telling me to go and give the metal a massage
load it , feel it ( bang ! )
hold it , squeeze it ( gassed ! )
these mcs on the grime scene , they ain't never done what they spit 'bout ( liars ! )
if i had a pound for every time that they said gun , i'd be rich now ( liars ! )
tell a man , tell another man , tell the next man , tell everybody with a big mouth
i ain't one of these likkle fuckboys , pay me respect - no discount
draw my something , make the lead fly , and erase all my enemies
for tryna write me off , yes don , vest on , who told you i ruled out your headside ? ( d - d - d - dead guy )
god forbid you make it to the hospital
cause i'll be the one by the bedside
tell my man i'm a general , he ain't even second in command
tell a man , tell another man , tell the next man , tell em wah gwan
i'm going on like i ain't ever read a psalm
ready or not , weapon in my palm , setting off alarms , so road that i'm never in my yard
tell my man i'm a general , he ain't even second in command
tell a man , tell another man , tell the next man , tell em wah gwan
i'm going on like i ain't ever read a psalm
ready or not , weapon in my palm , setting off alarms , so road that i'm never in my yard
