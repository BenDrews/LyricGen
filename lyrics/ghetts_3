colt 45
rider , road all night
you – or your lie
thank god you got home all right
i heard you what you said
pussyhole , no more lies
don’t think you’re rough
you’re butterflying some bogle guy
i’m wicked and bad
come through swinging a bat
you wanna fight with your fist and feet ?
rudeboy , visit japan
this go clickety clack
and i don’t mind flicking the shank
i ain’t got a number for mark morrison
but i’m ringing the mac
look around me
nothing but real niggas around me
one two or white gyal
three or four lighties
five or six darkies
seven or eight brownings
drink magnums everyday
but that don’t make us alchies
wallahi
i say ‘ayy gyal’ like a yardie
i can do so much with this paper
boy , you'd think i learnt origami
point me to the party
big joint like i'm marley
enjoying it calmly
avoid me if you're jarring
check this
i need 20 on the guest list
i need henny on the rider
let kelly and her friends in
spending
every penny that i left with
‘everything get lock arff’
if i see enemies in my section
death wish
who’s got a death wish ?
i can make that wish come true
i’m the red genie and i’m horrendous
jafari
don’t ‘hi’ , ‘hello’ or ‘wha gwan’ me
i go anywhere in the world
but i wouldn’t go carni
draw out
gotta bring the sword out
even if you get away when you - when you’re there
i bet feds kick your door down
but if man played
“aaa – aaa”
at rampage
you can bet that will get torn down
