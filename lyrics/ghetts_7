i woke up with a point to prove
but going at you is like a 3 point turn in the desert
that's a pointless move
i told my nigga leroy
don't return with the weapon
get rid of it and destroy the proof
my enemies are in the same room , good
get 'em all in one like a boiler suit
black tactical vest , same one i wore in the boiler room
oi , you , turn the kettle on
play the same role as my ex , why's this boy confused ?
i mean you , take your kettle off , i ain't playin' no games
i want a rolex oyster , too
patience
nah , i ain't a waiter
and if i was , poison you
your hand ting ain't handy
you remind me of andy
why would he hit the bullseye ?
he don't know what these toys can do
i got niggas in jail that can't see from the 6
i'm trying to avoid the view
but i still need this extra capital
it's amazing what having no choice can do
it made ghetts an animal
mario , i'm on a coin pursuit
adios to the boys in blue
man is cold , can't avoid the flu
( let that digest for a second , ghetts )
why am i so sick with this shit ?
surely , when you're poorly
antidotes and anointments due
who's this lyrical on this tempo ?
with syllables , with dem flows
my ting's spiritual , esco
i 'ear the subliminals
watch when i let go
kill 'em all , cancer
wordplay , west coast
snooping around with two packs of cigarettes
oh the doctor can't save you , death row
are you dumb ?
you don't feel ghetts , are you numb ?
deaf , blind , paralyzed from the head down ?
anyone with half a brain has to rate how i get down
tell me , you fuckin' tell me
who's been going this hard for newham
since titch got sent down ? ( no one )
i want the respect now
who ain't done shit for their ends ?
you just being you let the ends down
so how can i let down a let down ?
i don't owe nobody shit
i wouldn't lend man 10 pound
yesterday i got some good advice off my friend brown
hold on , that's my good ting from bush
they say opposites attract
and that's why this east boy's westbound
but no gyal can make me lose focus
i still write like say i got a pen pal
firing , i can't put the skeng down
strip off the clip , i dump , reload , then line up a next round
i had to drop out the skunk this year
i know about sacrifice
my mum broke up with my dad over 15 years ago
and ain't brought any men 'round
so it's nothing for me to get my head out the lem cloud
still you niggas have no idea
they can't see like , said they got , no eye dere
bambi with no eyesight , no eye deer
this be the flow i fear
i'm so ahead of my time that this one's for your kids' kids
marty mcfly there i go right there
mr. underrated , so i hear
could you have pictured this
before post put the pictures in
how many folks would've known what i said ?
how many times has a man said i'm shit
just cause he don't know what i said ?
young thug and future fans
but they don't know what i said
ain't ghetto another word for hood ?
i guess i'm designed to go over your head
