who’s that ? get back , draw for the mac
that’s right , that’s an esco lyric
but right now i’m possessed by esco’s spirit
( headshot ! ) will have a nigga in a closed casket
open it up and fling a red rose in it
body ! after body ! after body ! after body !
no death toll limit
tell the innocent don’t bother getting involved in it
ya likkle ( pum pum ! )
this something goes ( boom , ba ba boom boom )
boom ! shotgun business
got my one on purpose
then accidentally shot one witness
( the hard one's dead , the soft one’s injured )
first gun i ever buss was a rebore
( everyone knows i coulda lost some fingers )
i know man that have lost their index
so i ain't had another one ever since then
still , me and my niggas we all hitmen
( murderer ! fuck about and i'll murder ya ! )
in an instant
i’ll catch one while he’s turning up
both hands hold the burner up
i'm gonna miss them
steady handed
pick it up like the weapon’s stranded
smooth criminal
who d’you reckon planned it ? ( i and i )
you can bread more all you want
you’ll die before i finish the second sandwich
toaster in the holster
if i sort man out
he's getting peppered , standard
