champagne in my throat
for every day i was broke
i'm getting bread
so i be raising a toast , i'm like " cheers ! "
" here's to the years there weren't a reason we could celebrate ( the good life ) "
weed so loud i need a hearing aid
whenever we roll out , man ah regulate
bread , bring the seagulls round , check the resume
she know g - h - e - double - t - o's ego's like nino's
but anyway
gyaldem are surprised when they see man on the dance floor
like why , what d'you think i'm in the dance for ?
now i gotta tell a black beauty i'm a dark horse
knightrider , i let the car talk
party animal , ain't no rest for the wicked
and i am bad like mike was
black gloves , white socks
leather jacket with the zips , my gosh
all the freaks so chic
stepping out , living large like party animals
and we get so deep
mandy ain't letting me sleep , party animals
all the freaks so chic
stepping out , living large like party animals
where the waitress ? there , line 'em up
jaegerbomb , tequila , line 'em up
no beef , so cuz , you bought a knife for what ?
my nigga looked like puffy but we shined him up
ask about me
a dance without me ?
it's like bad boys without mike lowery
beenie man without no bounty
so solid crew without no audi
all - black everything type of affair
black creps , black hooligans
c63 outside
a black backseat , two black nubians
feeling like i'm caesar , gyaldem call me julius
party animals , ain't no rest for the wicked
and i am bad like mike was
leather jacket , black gloves
white socks with the loafers , my gosh
bottles with no sorrows
surrounded by models without morals
all my niggas macks , no donald's
we be living like there ain't no tomorrow
