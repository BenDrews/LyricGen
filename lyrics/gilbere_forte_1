look at my life , this is what i do
you was taking flights but you ain’t ever flew
i put it all on the line , i’m standing on the money
life is my bitch , you will never take her from me
look at my life , this is what i do
you was taking flights but you ain’t ever flew
i put it all on the line , i’m standing on the money
life is my bitch , you will never take her from me
stuck in a room , eyes real low , staring at the engineer ‘cause time froze
blurry vision , i’m only seeing what god chose
so i let my heart breathe and i sigh slow
at any minute , i could lose my vibe
a couple of single bitches drunk from the high
a couple lies , couple flows and them hard bars
a screw face is all of you damn pop - tarts
i just wanna make this music , fuck you and your pop charts
i’m a blessing to this art , the message i retort
nothing is impossible but imposters can measure you
tell it you’ll never make it , death is only awaiting
the dreams of a man , life full of richness , wealth in the soul
believe it or get rid of it , i’m only trying to find out where i’m headed
and if heaven never calls , i’m still rocking god on my letterman
