i’ve seen a lot of people change when they’re with the wrong people
killing off their friends just to feel a little equal
first they say “fuck you” , then they say they fucking need you ,
life is such a movie , so we’re about to live the sequel
she’s double cupped up , she faded
taking time , living life the way she made it
she’s double cupped up , she faded
that’s why i power shit , pimp nigga swaying
she’s double cupped up
cadillac music , top down way , crusin
she’s double cupped up
just riding slow , i’m riding home
it was this chick that i knew from 2006
graduated , made it from a college of dicks
now who the fuck you be , bitch , you know me
trying to act solo , down low , hush hush you low key , shit
i thought i was your homie , hate your friends
till the night you tried to fuck me in the back of your man’s benz
but i get the plan and i smoke the pussy and i get the frame
and i fuck the brains , swimming all along till she caught remote , try saying my name
and i’ve been all in your business , girl
but i wish you the best all in your dreamworld
but i know it’s hard being single with a body
got a million eyes on you , don’t know which one is the lottery
chasing your next moves for opportunities
monogamy , you want it all and think about it when you’re gone
cause honestly your past is a future of its own
it was 11 and below pm
slide low in a ‘lac till i see him
see , i see why i met you
hoes still so lavish
nothing but the best ho , chopped n screwed tiesto
europenos , bet that she knows , white girl is for that black love
i’m feeling that adrenaline rush when i’m feeling along your bum
feeling like i wanna fuck , is you really worth this nut ?
pillow behind my head , cause i like the feeling of it
oh , what a wonderful feeling when she sucking me off the edge.
shup up that paper hold , chop up that paper hold
just watch your teeth , though , and do it to the beat slow
to the tempo , instrumental , i see when blow smoking , therefore i ain’t hear what you’re saying
time don’t make the money , but my time is for the rich
pockets feel like 8ball , bitches call me mr. big , mr. big
you hear what the fuck i say ?
a lot of people change when their world starts to split
i take the money while you chop the leaves
