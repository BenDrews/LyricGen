harlem , big trucks like ?
i rock the big watch with the flooded band
i got niggas from the motherland
in the winter you could catch him with a summer tan
i whip the ghost like a go - kart
so then it's tell me when the show starts
i'm coming out flooded like noah's ark
and fuck the light cause you know my wrist glow in the dark
you niggas stylin' but you fake wildin'
we four warriors deep when we on ?
they tryna cool me off like antifreeze
but i'm hot like the shots when the hammer squeeze
hold up , it's a new kid on the block
waited 87 dreams for me to get my shot
with a mean grill you could picture my drop
when i ride through everything just stop
back on the gas , way ahead of my class
see the pipes burning from the bikes on the ave
so ahead of my life i let my grandson have
the whole fucking world , i just throw it in the bag
midwest kid with flows for all ages
barbershop clean , nutcracker type flavors
big ? versace's , coogi's , linens
i'll wear versace's , no socks in my timberlands
i'm hot like the chicken off the halal trucks
you a latte nigga cause i'm getting star bucks
i'm live on the set , the bass brought the streets out
it's hot in this bitch , y'all niggas send a tweet out
it's hot in this bitch , the gullwing's a sauna
the leather just stick to my skin like under armour
ride with a material girl , the black madonna
face like a virgin , she wants me to lucky star her
i'm lovin' her aura , shearling by zara
she take me as i am , tossing weight like toccara
decapitated sl's and audi slr - a
the last samurai to your roof , sayonara
eghck ! blood sweat and tears
through the years , now the new found fame , i call it karma
these niggas bipolar , i'm who they love to hate
praying for my downfall , now they chalk it up to fate
i chalk it up to chalking up the plate that i scrape
peyton manning arm & hammer with the plays that i make
nfl , that's no fucking losses
a great defense makes an even better offense
we ownin' , muthafuckin' rollin' , ain't nobody fuckin' with my - -
