you are my light , you are my dark
you are forever my sin
while my dogs don't talk and my lips don't walk
you are forever my pin
while my eyes roll black when i highs i got blowing that mary lich
with the doctor try to describe me
man it feel like i lost my mind
i'm unconscious , but i'm breathing
thought ever pinch between now what is sleeping
a young boy with a man's heart , in a women world
thought i found victim of addiction , in a vixen
tryina send in contradiction
talking bout now all the people's opinions
but why fuck love with a condom
to go raw when i'm out here lost
and y'all niggas tryna live trill
but go crazy when the shit get real
when the pain calls back from the head i got
from the bad bitches , sleep , sleep , nap , nap
she suck my soul , that's why don't let me the god i kept in the sack
a victim of missing you , a victim of pissing true
and in my mind , in my head
is this where we all came from
the dreams we have , the love we share
this is what we're waiting for
and in my mind , in my head
is this where we all came from
the dreams we have , the love we share
this is what we're waiting for
make me feel like i lost my mind ( x8 )
start wicked to a coast '
cause i'm wicked to the achin to my own regrets
never try to hold in when you know it's best
but i only know this wrong
she got the body of a god , i only notice it's raw
my man said dog , it will be all good
pussy run the world but the track suit on
nike roshe , just don't make it into cold and oj
but she sip through foreplay , letting you realize you done fucked for 4 days
then she said she pregnant , you ain't seen her in 4 days , damn
get it all been worse , dedicated to a chick that flirts
she tries to turn it down , but the way it don't work
you an athiest , try to find some truth in church
so you walk in , pastor talking like he a master
you don't listen to him , then you a bastard
living life with a growl pain , you forget to nodes thangs
fars as rio , me with the women i be , fantasizing
beyond whatever you been imagining
and in my mind , in my head
is this where we all came from
the dreams we have , the love we share
this is what we're waiting for
and in my mind , in my head
is this where we all came from
the dreams we have , the love we share
this is what we're waiting for
