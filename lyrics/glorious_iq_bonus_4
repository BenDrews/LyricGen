in an effort to get 1 , 000 rap songs from 2014 transcribed , we are introducing a new initiative that will grant massive amounts of iq to those who transcribe by ear. each week , a new list of the untranscribed songs from 10 projects from 2014 will be compiled. these are all songs that don't have lyrics available online , so to reward the users who are putting in extra time to get these lyrics up , each transcription will be worth 65+ iq
