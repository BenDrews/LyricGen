heaven knows you mean well
heaven won't you lead us
let me know if i shall
god can only save us now
i walk into the building and i'm back like
a 45 jersey under black light
jordan era rap , extraordinarily crack
missed the past couple seasons , fuck the past
every time i’m on this mic i'm michelangelo painting portraits of hell
this bitch had thought she could keep me under a shell
shootin shells at the roof , this is no longer a coupe
this a coup de tat , find the quickest route to getting loot
nigga , tell 'em when i'm there i'll beat the rookie of the year
and after that the mvp , been a champ my whole career
put my crew all on my shoulders with me everywhere i go
i ain't stopping til i'm on and when i'm on i want a throne
man , i been a king , nigga
girls on the floor going crazy
in a mercedes , feeling like i’m jay z
and you know we probably faded
bitch , we celebratin'
feelin' like i’m jay z
i’m feelin' like i'm jay z
these bitches got me out here feelin' like i'm jay z
i’m feelin' like i'm jay z
i'm with my niggas and i'm feelin' like
look like the son of a god inside the mind of a man
i got the heart of a lion , i got the head of a ram
i paint pictures with words nigga , i fuck up a pen
been bodybagging these tracks ever since i fucking began
same ass nigga that i was back then
i don’t rock no gold chain , i don't got no rolex
i don't got no gold grill , but i'm mad real and my flow sick
and i go hard , i'm over looked
over due , i over work
overdosed on all that kush , overload , comatose
i'm back , i'm never stoppin' on some hova shit
had to stop cause bitches always actin' on some bogus shit
think i'm resurrected lights all on a nigga glow and shit
feel like i'm the greatest so the greatest seem appropriate
nigga what ?
real nigga , i'm on one , these niggas ain't on shit
stop worrying about old shit , shoutout to my old...
girls on the floor and they worshippin 'me
they twerkin' for me , i'm god in here
stunt on hoes i kinda dated , i kinda made it , we right up here
man , you know i'm rolling deep
fuck whatever club if my whole team ain’t here with me
we got a couple bottles and some bitches in the back
her heads in my lap , she love the way i rap
