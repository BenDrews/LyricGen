g herbo
its life , love , peace and prosperity nigga
get money
wake up start my day with a fifth of rosé
different show every night on the road
no sleep or no breaks
i'm still fresh out of three or four states
told myself its just me and show dates
remember counting my first 50 cash
remember breakfast time eating no plates
and i'm humble cuz it can be gone any day
i was blessed to see the money came
young nigga went and blew that shit anyway
now when i reach the success of my life
make me remember nights when i weren't living right
don't know what letting off them pistols like
i still gotta keep that missile tight
won't see me changin' for no one or for nothin'
i , i still remember i came from
i'm still that nigga the same one
i ain't gon change for no bitch or no money
i , i still remember i came from
i'm still that nigga the same one
same nigga always , i never changed , ever , never changed
people changed around me i , never changed
never never never never change never changed
i dreamt me and and my momma met in a different life
she said if you show your soul they'll see a threat
i said nobody judge me if you raise me correct
she said nah they always come for your chest
but that's just humanity
well momma , i'm tryna look further than any human man can see
contemplation , what can human minds grasp ?
cuz i'm aimin beyond that
and then beyond beyond that
and i found that moving mountains is as easy as smilin'
and stylin' on these lame la county residents
ever since the second i landed
freestyled but look like we planned it
peace of knowledge nigga , önły ü dēfinê ü
whole life all these other motherfuckers try to
but ten times out of nine you getting lied to
so we should burn down their infrastructure
i know that we ain't gotta suffer
man it ain't never noone up above you
and i know that you ain't even bout that muzzle
always been something they can't define
that make them try harder to put you in line
they try to block when a nigga shine
so i just go further inside my mind
now they getting pressed you just impressive
its something higher that you connect with
that's yourself maybe your reflection
i'm saying just don't lose your only weapon
that's your train of thought , pray to god
its an old tradition niggas getting bought
so never trust nobody
my suggestion always keep that in your heart
cuz check me out cuz when i'm on the road
i wouldn't compromise my inner glow
all i hear is get rich or die trying
but niggas don't die they only go higher
won't see me changin' for no one or for nothin'
i , i still remember i came from
i'm still that nigga the same one
i ain't gon change for no bitch or no money
i , i still remember i came from
i'm still that nigga the same one
same nigga always , i never changed , ever , never changed
people changed around me i , never changed
never never never never change never changed
i'm the hottest young nigga spitting sick shit
like this out my city period and i'm serious
if there is another nigga like me i ain't even curious
never satisfied so i'm always getting better never terrified
stay ahead of time got these other rapper niggas petrified
