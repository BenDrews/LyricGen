word to my nigga p - bam , he goin' feel this
you ain't really livin' til you hit the bottom
when you comin' from it , and you make it
to the top of the mountain
that's where the gold at
but gold's in your mind , never mind , never rush a nigga
cause' i'm from the same city lil' herb , bibby
and i'm already feelin' like a legend , pac , biggie
diddy money ain't enough i'm tryna get it like dre
billion dollar mission , get the fuck up out my way
man these labels need to pay
i'm a nigga wit' an attitude , and i don't like to wait
i never touch on the brakes , never let up the pace
look me in my face , try and tell a nigga he ain't great

nigga , you ain't got no business talkin' to me
you ain't talkin' 'bout me , you better wise up
cause a nigga finna rise up
blake griffin slam dunk on niggas from the risers
i'm comin' for you , gunnin' for it
runnin' from it ain't an option

they should win an oscar
sick to my stomach , might just end up in a hospital
what you finna do , put yourself in my shoes
when they robbin' you
nothin' is impossible , when you know you unstoppable
when you don't fear the consequence
then you get the confidence
to be everything you 'pposed to be , uh
to all the niggas that been waitin' , ya'll late
pump fake , game straight
pull up , wipe the glove off , gary payton
i'm that type of nigga , when i shoot it , already made it
