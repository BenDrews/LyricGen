a small voice in my head
a cancer in my subconscious
they try to infiltrate my world and poison down my spine
but if what they thought mattered
if it was meant to save me
how could i be walking away from it all right now ?
my vice is my voice
my words are my weapon
and i don't give a fuck about it
uh , love is war , i'm out here killing hoes
my mind is grammy colored
i'm a king , quote , unquote
my ex made me hate the fall , i call it vertigo
split a swisher , stitch it together , help me get vertical
this the anthem for prayers that go unanswered
pour some henney out for the pussy that's unsampled
cause i just need a bitch to do the splits for a nigga
god , forgive me , cause i'm talking like a muhfuckin' sinner , nigga
dreaming big and always hoping hard
that yacht iâ€™m hopin for got strippers and an open bar
and y'all don't know this but you're saving my life now
right now , with every word i write down
my nigga , this shit gospel if it's spitten
a scripture if it's written
i talk in future tense , that's just part of having vision
busting through the ceiling like a trap door
i'mma make you mad
fuck you think i rap for , nigga , uh
i don't give a , i don't give a
i don't give a fuck about it
i don't give a , i don't give a
i don't give a fuck about it
party every day , party all night
blowing smoke up in the air
yeah , we tryna get right
you start a second verse if you bodied the first , hearse
blessed are the beats i fucking speak on , church
i played the tables at caesar's
ended up a believer
i chased success for a minute
and now i'm trying to leave her
i know this girl who likes to roll a lot
she sends me mirror shots
it's perfect , too
she let me smash and she ain't really here a lot
met me at a show and she's in love because i rap
she got a ass , don't need more reasons than that
got a devil and an angel on my shoulder playing tug of war
that's so much pressure , this is what drugs was invented for
i decided that weed is a good habit
i make good music , you niggas is all students , huh
say you know that i'm the nigga that it's time for
that's the kinda talent , recognize it with a blindfold
that just illustrates that i am literally beyond folk
that's the point of proving it
fuck you if i'm not dope
i don't give a , i don't give a
i don't give a fuck about it
i don't give a , i don't give a
i don't give a fuck about it
party every day , party all night
blowing smoke up in the air
yeah , we tryna get right
i'm just a young nigga with a dollar and a dream
barely got a dollar
just a lighter and some green
most of my best nights are spent forgetting everything i've seen
i'm just hungry , tryna get it , get it , popping on the scene
( i'm just a young nigga )
popping on the scene , nigga , you know what i mean , nigga
tryna give my muhfuckin' vision to the screen
i'm just a young nigga
i ain't concerned about your plans
i'm staring up at god , i want the money in advance
fuck you , pay me
fuck niggas that hate me
don't nobody like me , but it ain't nobody like me
you know you living that good life
when you pinch yourself and you blink twice
and you took too many pills and you just can't tell if it's real life
end of the day , i'm just a fucking man
i'm just a young nigga , i don't follow a plan
i know a lot of these niggas is gon' be dream killers
you gotta make it through the pain to be a real nigga
say you know
i don't give a , i don't give a
i don't give a fuck about it
i don't give a , i don't give a
i don't give a fuck about it
party every day , party all night
blowing smoke up in the air
yeah , we tryna get right
