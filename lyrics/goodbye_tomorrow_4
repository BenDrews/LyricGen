pray to god , pray to god , pray to god x 4
my nigga we get turnt up
live inside this moment
i'm on another planet , i digested serotonin
blowin' hydroponic my nigga fuck my opponents
pass out way too fuckin' late and wake up early in the mornin'
i'm acting out my fears , but on these symphonies i'm blackin'
cause how could i be sober and deal with all these distractions ?
that’s just how the fuck i do it
get hype and lose control
it's a optical illusion if you find a nicer flow
i'm going ham
bitch i'm going ham
if you don’t like it , you don’t fuckin' understand nigga , damn nigga
wait 'til the day i got some money in my jeans
my whole clique up in this club look like we on a fuckin' team
or like we own a team , that’s mark cuban money
but i just want that i'm the dictator of cuba money
i'm 'bout to get it muthafuck who said i couldn’t
so show me all the money my nigga that’s cuba gooding huh ?
pray to god , pray to god , pray to god
pray to god , pray to god , pray to god , pray to god
i , i
i pray to god that my soul don’t lose , that my soul don’t lose , that my soul don’t lose
i pray to god that my soul don’t lose , that my soul don’t lose , that my soul don’t lose
my nigga i just wake up , get baked to make it back up
back demons into corners , give me strength to make it back up
to where i was whenever in early 2011 when all the critics was lovin' it , tried to cop a percentage , ho
random cities full of bitches who gon' feel me , let me feel em up and puff on marijuana from a philly , ho
nights is fuckin' crazy
i write some ill shit daily
lights is trippy , mood was wavy , bitches went , now niggas goin ham
for krewella
that’s my family , those my niggas , man they bout to tour europe
and everything that they doin' , is everything that i shoulda
shoulda blew up , shoulda made it , i keep on hearin' i coulda
and my time is comin' up , never runnin' out of time
i ain't runnin' out of nothin' , but my muthafuckin mind
when i'm trippin'
i'm crazy nigga listen
been through a bunch of bullshit
that’s why my new shit sound kinda different nigga uh
