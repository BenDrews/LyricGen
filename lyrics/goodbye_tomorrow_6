too many people let weak shit slide
they don't blink their eyes or acknowledge that
too much politics , participatin' , and policies i got problems with
it's too many fakes in the game , nigga
too many people that'll fall for that
i'm too fresh to get involved with that
that's why you'll never catch me in any photographs
they tryna block my thoughts 'fore i even talk
i knew right then when i recorded that
said i need 100
haven't seen 100
get an email saying i owe it back
it's too many snakes , wolves , animals
too many people tryna take me for a fool
too many people ask questions
not too many know how to do what i do
i got too much to say , so i stay quiet
when i do talk , it's always met with silence
confused faces
people usually don't get what my place is and think i'm wylin'
never been scared of getting silenced
let me just break down the science
i got these niggas straight shook and i ain't even violent
too many wanna be bad boys flexin' like they're so rowdy
look a bad boy straight in the face
tell him i'm a real bad boy , fuck mike lowrey
too many wanna be bad boys flexin' like they're so rowdy

lost my train of thought
cause i trained to win the war
too many people knock lightly or too politely i knock down doors
man we too locked on and focused to see these locusts , or any other type of swarm
seen a lotta people had to leave from round the scene , they weren’t about what we’re on
too many wanna move backwards , or move to hollywood , became actors
i don’t trust the taste of the tastemakers
i don’t fuck with you , ya websites , or pages
half you niggas boxed in by statistics , the other half are just pretendin'
too many follow formats then get trapped in mental cages
cuz all i'm saying's
they use our shit & demoralize
all the things that we glorify
if that's just what they got caught on film , imagine all the shit we don't know about
fuck you
your perspective is irrelevant
ya'll will never take me out my element
too many wanna be bad boys flexin' like they're so rowdy
look a bad boy straight in the face
tell him i'm a real bad boy , fuck mike lowrey
