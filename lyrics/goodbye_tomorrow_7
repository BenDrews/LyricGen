28 , that’s when basquiat died
28 , barely feelin' alive
28 , days until the ride
one month 'til we
told my niggas they should wait a minute
the world gon' love me now or later , either way i'm winnin'
people stay pretendin' and it drive me crazy my nigga
the greatest ever or you crazy trippin' my nigga
but now a nigga livid , a nigga livin' , the picture vivid
these og's tellin' a nigga that they don’t fuckin remember
you niggas cool , but you mad suspect
when a beat get killed , why i'm always a suspect
my apologies i ain't know i be this late
but i ain't felt this fuckin' cold since the sicktape
wrap my issues up in swishers , take a drag of them
me and mr. music in the stu , back at it again
dust off all these mops and all they mint - conditioned packaging
and open up and go for it nigga i been practicin'
uh , this the cleanest my flow ever been
bout to leave the chi and bring it back a seventh ring
verses on lock snappin' like an old key ; til the hoes blow me like derrick rose knee huh ?
god willing i gotta feeling i'm getting close
niggas who patient shootin' jumpers get em in the most
niggas hatin' while i act so lenient
i don’t really even hear them , they just background singers
god save any nigga go to war with us
that’s a sinking ship full of hoes like a tour bus
i can see why i got girls from out of state obsessin
light skin and fly , clutch under pressure
i'm the type that break the rules and then ignore the lecture
my song belong on walls , in homes of art collectors
yeah , i really hope you niggas feel this
and feel me when i say the goal is fillin' up arena's
take that how you will , you was better in the offseason
i been killing everything , all season
all - city , all - state , all - rhyming
best of all
i forgot it like alzeheimer's
yeah , that’s just how i does it
solo , imagine how it would be with a budget ?
wow , or how it could be if it wasn’t
nothing but some wack rappers in this industry that’s buzzin
so fuck the world from the back , ya'll don’t see my on a track like i'm clear runnin' a lap nigga
i'm at a place in which i think was really meant for me
and even though i don’t believe that anything is meant to be
mentally , i'm on this grandiose platform
seein visions , makin dreams , and closin' all the back doors
no more shortcuts to these back roads
paved the path for a better life though
so really there ain't nothin else for me to ask for
shit i'm here nigga started at the asphalt , ugh !
ridin' through my city could get shot
they might not let you see another day like pac
i'm just dyin' to make it , cuz i believe in what i do
starrin' in the mirror ain't nobody standin' front of you
you can feel it in your soul like preacher's in front of you
it’s a god speakin' down in front of you
changin' lives is a job , i wake up and i go hard
cliché shit but fuck a broad , tryna take the crew abroad
man me and my niggas we just waitin' on the call
but really i ain't waitin' , i'm just workin'
hoes twerkin'
and i'm certain these niggas closin' they curtains when they see me , they don’t see me , but they really bout to feel me
pause !
bitches out they bras
ain't no fiction , ain't no crack whippin'
ain't no pistol poppin , ain't no wood grain grippin'
just a real nigga listen
you into false hopes , you ain't even know it , but admit it
i'm into smokin weed , rappin' off the top , and makin history
no ceilin unless the fuckin ceilin' is the sistine
it's like god everytime i do a 16
i'm like god everytime i do 16 god , 28
sorry if im late
28
tell them niggas that i'm sorry that i'm late
