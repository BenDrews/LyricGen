when i look back at my life
i see myself smilin'
i see myself shinin'
i see you and me
when i look back at my life
i don’t wanna have to think twice
no regrets , no regrets , nigga
private jets , private jets nigga
they waitin' on me
i know they are
my momma always told me that i'd make it far
far as i wanna go , gotta keep my mind focused
gotta reinvent myself , gotta keep my eyes open
gotta keep up with good health
i gotta do it big
they say i'm way too fuckin' talented to ever quit
i'm the shit , but i ain't shit that’s why i'm humble
and watchin' wack niggas eatin' only make me hungry
i'm a low key , mowgli , ruler of the jungle
on some og dro weed cloud we sittin' under , huh
at the top , only god could be above it
runnin' out the holy field , touchdown muthafucka
in due time , i will shine , bright as the stars
in due time , i will shine , bright as the stars
brighter than the stars , brighter than the stars
brighter than the stars , brighter than the stars
i'm hopin' i open minds with spoken lines
if not that’s gucci cause we smokin pines , we dreamin' nigga
muthafuck yo image nigga i just wanna rap bitch
i'm just tryna blow up , let a nigga fuck a actress
i just want my niggas , who ain't had shit to have shit
let em live good , just to balance out the bad shit
back in the day , they was bangin' where my granny stay
i swore on everything , that’s changin' after grammy day
but fuck a chain , i rearranged how i'm viewin' shit
tuck your chain , pay homage to the crew and shit
whatcha doin ? shit , huh ?
same shit i always say
prayin' people hatin' or doubtin' about me fall away
i spit cold , til my lips froze , schizo
me and myself , better than your whole clique so stand
sit , shit i give a fuck , stand
lay down sleepin on me , but a nigga's home like french man
in due time , i will shine , bright as the stars
in due time , i will shine , bright as the stars
brighter than the stars , brighter than the stars
brighter than the stars , brighter than the stars
yessir , yeah , yeah , yessir
shine on em x3
shine , shine
stars bright in my earlobes
she know i'm worth it
she know i'm shinin'
she light one , she pour one
im sober and that’s perfect timin'
i'm stressed out , not high , i need green , i'm popeye
i need a girl , who don’t think , and i hope she not camera shy
chi city , primetime
got me glowin' like a diamond in the nighttime
feelin' fresh , smokin' weed
blue stars , green money , purple trees
chi city , primetime
nigga glowin' like a diamond in the nighttime
feelin fresh , smoking weed
blue stars , green money , purple trees
brighter than the stars x4
bright as the stars x4
