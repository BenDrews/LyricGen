saved my life , woah
do you feel like a teardrop in the ocean ?
can you feel the dark force in the air ?
is it hard when you get up , and get back in the moment ?
and you're not moving anywhere
do they tell you " dream small and surrender
to what is easy and in the front of your face " ?
if you're scared , you only doubt and you're never getting out
then this is what you gotta say
i'm saving...

are you stuck in a rat race that you won't win ?
are you scared that you'll never wake up ?
will they make you punch in , when you're there in the morning
and punch out when they've had enough ?
well , there's a life and it's out there for the taking
you can run and you can leave this behind
tell you , it's a trap and they caught you in the act
ain't nothing but a state of mind
i'm save....
