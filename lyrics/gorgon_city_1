you came off , you scared to fall
and you came off , keep on the armour every time
it's one hell of a performance
you came off , just keep the same there at the try
i can't fix you if you're broken
if you can't crawl then you can't teach me how to fly
i'm uncertain , i'm hoping
if they ask me , i still tell 'em that you're mine
we don't wanna fight , we don't wanna fall in
it gets hard to dive and i
we don't wanna fight , we don't wanna call it
i still wanna try and i
could this be us ?
are we running from the same ghost ?
could this be us ?
and we fall before the flame goes down
you can't blind me with your conscience
i gets harder to see the fear in your eyes
we can both win if you coming
it's as easy as pretending that we're blind
never said i can't , never said i won't
so hard when there's a doubt
and we're drowning , we wanna be free
hardest when you're having doubts
we don't wanna fight , we don't wanna fall in
it gets hard to dive and i
we don't wanna fight , we don't wanna call it
i still wanna try and i
could this be us ?
are we running from the same ghost ?
could this be us ?
and we fall before the flame goes down
could this be us ?
are we running from the same ghost ?
could this be us ?
and we fall before the flame goes down
could this be us ?
are we running from the same ghost ?
could this be us ?
and we fall before the flame goes down
could this be us ?
are we running from the same ghost ?
could this be us ?
and we fall before the flame goes down
