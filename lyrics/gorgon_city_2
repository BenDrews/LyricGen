imagine i was good again
but you still see me the same
and baby , why can't you pretend
that nothing here has changed ?
let's rewind , we'll be fine
you forgave me , believe that i'm sorry
close your eyes , we'll be fine
come back inside , there is no need to worry
i need you to use , use , use , use
use , use your imagination
i need you to use , use , use , use
use , use your imagination
no , no , no
don't tell me that you're leaving
i need you to use , use , use , use
use , use your imagination
imagine you remember me
and that you still believe a word i say
see , everybody makes mistakes
and if we make - believe it will go away
let's rewind , we'll be fine
you forgave me , believe that i'm sorry
close your eyes , we'll be fine
come back inside , there is no need to worry
i need you to use , use , use , use
use , use your imagination
i need you to use , use , use , use
use , use your imagination
no , no , no
don't tell me that you're leaving
i need you to use , use , use , use
use , use your imagination
come close to me
tell me what you want me to do
won't you imagine it
won't you let me talk to change your mind , change your mind ?
no holding back
i've been waiting so patiently
with me , you will be safe
come with me before our time runs out , our time runs out
i need you to use , use , use , use
use , use your imagination
i need you to use , use , use , use
use , use your imagination
no , no , no
don't tell me that you're leaving
i need you to use , use , use , use
use , use your imagination
