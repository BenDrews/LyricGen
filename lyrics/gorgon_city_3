as the minutes turn to hours
with the fading of the daylight
and a heartbeat full of colour
is turning into black and white
it's like every day
these four walls are closing in
on all you had , and all you hold
and all you love
but now all four walls are falling down
all four walls ( all four walls )
yeah , all four walls are falling down
all four walls ( all four walls )
( all four walls )
( all four walls )
as the days all pull together
and are pale under fluorescent lights
all the ghosts i see before me
leave me holding to the burning light
and in every way
these four walls are closing in
on all you had , and all you hold
and all you love
but now all four walls are falling down
all four walls ( all four walls )
yeah , all four walls are falling down
all four walls ( all four walls )
all you have , all you hold
all you love ( all four walls )
all you have , all you hold
all you hold , all you love
( all four walls )
all you have , all you hold
all you love ( all four walls )
all you have , all you hold
all you hold , all you love
but now all four walls are falling down
all four walls ( all four walls )
yeah , all four walls are falling down
all four walls ( all four walls )
all four walls are falling down
all four walls ( all four walls )
yeah , all four walls are falling down
all four walls ( all four walls )
