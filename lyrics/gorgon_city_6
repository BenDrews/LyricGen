i know we'll make it
i know we'll make it through
one thing's for certain
i will be here for you
don't overthink it
don't question what we do
one thing's a constant
that i'll be here for you
we all go through changes , love in different places
that doesn't mean that we have to part
and when you feel like nobody's on your side
please believe i'm never too far
never too far
never too far
never too far
never too far
never too far
never too far
never too far
never too far
i , i i will be here for you
i will be here for you
i , i i will be here for you
i will be here for you ( i'll be here for you )
whether it's sunshine
whether it be rain
we'll stand the pressure
i will ease the pain
we all go through changes , love in different places
that doesn't mean that we have to part
and when you feel like nobody's on your side
please believe i'm never too far
never too far
never too far
never too far
never too far
never too far
never too far
never too far
never too far
i , i i will be here for you

i will be here for you ( i'll be here for you )
i , i i will be here for you
i will be here for you
i , i i will be here for you
i will be here for you ( i'll be here for you )
and when you're cast away
and you feel alone
i'll try to find you
i'll try to guide you home
i , i i will be here for you
i will be here for you
i , i i will be here for you
i will be here for you ( i'll be here for you )
i , i i will be here for you
