mmm.. mmm..
face - down , on my chest
wake up and you are there
your touch takes my tears
but i'm lying here , wondering if you are sincere
i pray that what you give me's real
i hate that it's the way i feel
but nothing seems to care for me to see
and i can't dream for love with you
if i can't recognize the truth
i watch you as you rest
i'm so confused
cause i don't wanna be used , darling , it's too hard on me
and i don't know what to do , darling , but choose honesty
but i don't wanna be used , darling , it's too hard on me
and i don't know what to do , darling , but choose honesty
brush your hair off your cheeks
and your smile as you're fast asleep
my fears tell me to go
but as you whisper in my ears , it's absolute
so i don't
i pray that what you give me's real
i hate that it's the way i feel
but nothing seems to care for me to see
cause i don't wanna be used , darling , it's too hard on me
and i don't know what to do , darling , but choose honesty
but i don't wanna be used , darling , it's too hard on me
and i don't know what to do , darling , but choose honesty
oh please , darling , don't use me
please , darling , don't use me
oh please , darling , don't use me
so i don't know how i can take it
i don't know how i can make it
and i don't know how i can take it
i don't know how i can make it
please , darling , don't
please , darling , don't
