for a little while
and when my i.u
is not here with me
i'm ? the helpless type ?
i'm sugar free
in the night
( so lonely , so lonely )
i'm sugar free
in the day
( so loneley , yeah )
i know he loves me
i know he cares
cause he's all mine
and soon he'll be knockin
at my door
things will be alright
i'm sugar free
in the night
( so lonely , so lonely )
i'm sugar free
in the day
( i feel so lonely , yeah )
listen , let me explain
i like livin my life in the fast lane
partyin hard and havin fun
females - i need more than one
straight up and down on the serious tip
i ain't with no relationship
it may sound like a diss but believe me it's not
matter of fact i really like you a lot
but it's a dead issue for you to pursue
cause yo boo , i like you but i like others too
the heartaches , the breaks , the pains , i don't need em
instead give me some head and a whole lotta freedom
i like to swing , i ain't with no commitment
parties , ladies and beer by the shipment
but when i do my thing you get mad
call me on the telephone soundin all sad
don't mean to hurt your feelings , my dear
but listen here , i'm the mack of the year
so if you have plans to settle down with me
i guess you just have to be - sugar free
oh my sugar's gone
he's gone away
i miss him every night
and every day ( 2x )
yeah , yeah , yeah
everyday , yeah
oh - ooohhh , oh
my sugar is gone
i - i - i.u

my sugar is gone
oh sugar
heeeeyyy - ey - eeeey
my sugar's gone
oh my sugar's gone
he's gone away
