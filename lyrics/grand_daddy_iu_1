introducin' daddy u and steady flow
lights , cameras , action , let's go
even the fat girls attack the tall mack
the chumps who lack fall back cause they all wack
so while they play the rear , girlies stay to hear
me and kay make you say hooray and cheer
rockin steady , straight and continuous
cool and casual , never too strenuous
cause i like to flow smooth , keepin' a slow groove
and i don't give a fuck if you don't move
cause either way i still get mine
combine and design dope lines of all kind
my competition stands stiff as a tree trunk
the dope i got is much rawer than p - funk
cause artificial stimulation don't last
but i maintain and remain to kick ass
i got somethin' to say that you shouldn't miss
you get with this ? ( oh , my goodness ! )
stay out the kitchen , the heat is too hot
and cookin' the pot is the i - dot - u - dot
and i.u. is the name they call me
the six foot tall grand daddy of em all , gee
i'm comin' at ya like a wild rhinoceros
take my crown ? that shit sound preposterous
cause all those attemptin' to do such
get caught in a clutch cause the u's just too much
it only take one look and you're under my spell
then you fell , what the hell , now you wonder why
you can't match the things i accomplish
you ever try to step to this , you get stomped , bitch
those who flam i slam , and goddamn
when i step in a jam you all scram
cause i get nitro , hot as a micro -
wave and behave buckwild like a psycho
as i laugh and do as i prefer to do
don't even crack a smile or i murder you
you fuckin' chump
hey yo kay , let the system pump
i kick ass
( i don't wanna hear that shit ! )
( i'll kick your ass ! )
never in life have you heard such poetry
cause ain't no man alive who can flow with me
all opponents get dust off quick fast
and you can kiss me , kay cee and easy rick ass
smoother than this can no three men flow
for those who didn't know , i provide info
for you and yours and his and hers
so yo , here's the scoop on what the group does
i kick ass cause the u is the violent kind
and get sporty with a forty of ballantine
while my man easy rick picks a skeezy chick
bust off and break north with a greasy dick
and dj kay cee cuts superb
six slick tricks on a mix and you're to the curb
competition gets worse and worse , you curse
rehearse , but still ain't get prop the first
fuckin' with me's more deadly than cyanide
and those who collide all die , so you try and hide
but in a bout , you get rendered senseless
defenseless , now it's time to commence this
i write rhymes that keep the crowd cheerin'
say type shit you never thought about hearin'
not just the same old same with a slight change
i elevate to an untouchable height range
beyond the stars mars , venus and jupiter
no way , no how , no man can get stupider
so cut the crap and save all the foolishness
there'll never be an mc as cool as this
so play the back , boy , fuck the bullshit
try to get flip , i guarantee that you'll get
your ass kicked , stretch ya just like elastic
broke like plastic , you stupid bastard
you should've known not to fuck with i.u
now i bet you're petro and try to
cause i make the mic bust off like a mac - 10
and keep the whole auditorium packed in
front to back from the stage to the hallway
kay'll blaze on the fade like always
rippin' the slice and dice , cuts are twice as nice
while i add spice to the mic device
my rap style's the best in the biz
word to miz , think it ain't what it is ?
cause rhyme after rhyme each verse flows loosely
hittin' like a brick and kickin' like bruce lee
what i invent keep the crowd content
i chew mc's like a stick of doublemint
knock em out the box and totally annihilate
one thing i hate is cheapskates who violate
smile in my face , give me a pound or a handshake
then behind my back you flip like a pancake
but all of that is envy and jealousy
a better mc than me you'll never be
you bum , you get none , son , not a mere crumb
now i'mma smack the wax off your eardrum
back off the set , pack your bags and flee
nah fuck it - call the police
if that don't work , then got a order of protection
but still i roll in your direction
i blast , harass and surpass quick fast
any mc who fuck with me , yo g , i kick ass
( i don't wanna hear that shit ! )
( i'll kick your ass ! )
yo
the grand daddy u is definitely on the map , homes
you know what i'm sayin
my man easy rick and dj kay cee
straight out hempstead , long island , homes
know what i'm sayin
fuck all the bullshit
( i'ma kick yo ass )
