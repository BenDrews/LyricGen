here it is , a world premiere
crystal clear in your ear , so listen here
yeah , it's somethin new but i ain't no new kid
so don't fool yourself with garbage that you did
ain't nothin changed so don't act strange
i'll shoot through your crew , so get out my range
cause i'm callin shots while i make my appearance
no interruptions , no interference
so turn it up loud and let the bass thump
give me the mic and watch the whole place jump
i kick a swift rap , sign a gift rap
so zip your lip , i ain't with that riff crap
i go for broke with the rhymes that i wrote
flow quote for quote , even hit the high note
rick picks the chicks , i tricks the fix
so sway to the way kay plays the mix
cause it's
somethin new
from the grand daddy u
grab a seat and take heed to the entrepreneur
for sure it's raw , literature hardcore
i'm ( light ) but not ( white ) quite bite , that's right
a parasite who bite i'll invite to fright night
so let it be known , the rap throne i own
so leave my bone and my microphone alone
i gets paid while others get slayed
you're goin out like a roach , i go out like raid
i won't back up or freeze up , slack up or ease up
cause daddy u is cold chewin mc's up
i gets raw with the rhymes i develop
so all of you suckers , shut the hell up
or i'll bend your chin and grin , you can't win
so spend 10 to get in then get ate for din - din
cause in a battle i gets rambunctious
so take heed , no need to pop junk , just
step ( step ) and bow out gracefully
cause if not , then , my man , your face'll be
damaged , in other words seriously hurt
this ain't sesame street , i ain't earnie or bert
when i'm through with you your crew will be residue
so just get out my face is what you better do
you wanna brawl , just call , that all
but if you don't come correct , you're taking a fall
cause it's
somethin new
from the grand daddy u
attention , class is bout to begin
prepare to take notes , grab your paper and pen
as i teach and preach and reach any or each
parasite or leech the u will impeach
i stomp the comp terminatin frauds
while the crowd applauds for the lord of lords
i kick off like a ninja , beef and i'll send ya
home with broken bones cause suckers i injure
and when i'm through you can pass the brew
but for now i got work to do
so no time to wait , don't debate or procrastinate
i'm rated great cause the fans i fascinate
shots are called , plugs are installed
fist is a ball , now it's time to brawl
suckers get played out ( ? ) are made out
punks get laid out and kay wears the fade out
i do away with those who come frontin here
what is you stupid , you can't get nothin here
so play your room or be doomed to rot in hell
you're cold booty , you're softer than cottonelle
think you can get this ? boy , don't be ridiculous
i shoot more gift than st. nicholas
men pretend to win but then the kay begin
to spin and blend again and again
( ? ) distinguished style that you can recognize
and i fail to understand how the heck them guys
borrow and bite and not have a guilty conscience
then grab the mic and recite silly nonsense
battle the u , you musta flipped your lid
cause i take your pride like a stick - up kid
bodily damage is done to those who try to stand close
while i swing and sing as smooth as luther vandross
rhymes consist of consonants and vowels
and while i move the crowd you move yours bowles
yeah
hey yo girls , tell em what this is
somethin , somethin , somethin new
from the grand daddy u
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah
i said somethin's new
from the grand daddy u
peep out somethin new
from the grand daddy new
alright girls , come on , all together now
somethin , somethin , somethin new
from the grand daddy u
that's right
