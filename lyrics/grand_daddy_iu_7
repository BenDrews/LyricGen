aight , let's go...
yo u
what's your response to the mc's down there on the corner , man
talkin about doin you somethin , man
what's up with that ?
first of all , man
no mc in the world can get with this , gee
yeah , i know that , but you know
well , this guy is talkin that foolishness
i tell you what , gee
yo , line em up
turn on your radio , here we go again
it's time for the u to flow again
mellow and smooth , blowin cool like a summer breeze
just like leaves from the trees , you dumb mc's
are gone with the wind
when i blow , you'll all end
so fasten your seatbelt , sit back and hold on
brace yourself and prepare to get rolled on
and i'ma take it to your death
watch you scream till your very last breath
i get vexed and explode like a bomb
catchin more bodies than vietnam
the mic's a fuse , and my brain is the dynamite
ignitin when type mc's keep tryin to write
rhymes like u
you can't swing it , you're doo - doo
talkin a lotta stuff , but that's not enough
it takes action , and you ain't got enough
so when you come , bring a army
even your mommy , and you still can't harm me
cause fake mc's , enemies , and foes
i just smack em and watch em fall like dominos
who's the smoothest , that's the question
if you don't know , then keep guessin
you're not sure ? well , here's a clue
it's one letter - the u
my technique and talent perplexes
while my rhyme flexes from here to texas
handsome and tall
you wanna battle ? come one , come all
i crush your world while your girlfriend swings low
get with this ? yo , i don't think so
so take a step to the back
what , is you stupid , or is it crack ?
my brain flows and grows like a embryo
suckers are frontin , but they don't really know
what damagin a mic's about
1 - 2 - 3 strikes - you're out
what i recite will ignite like sulfur
bite - you might catch a ulcer
so take this advice for your personal safety
drop your mic and get the hell away from me
cause enemies and foes
i just smack em and watch em fall like dominos
nice and easy , yeah , that's how it ought to be
if it ain't smooth , it ain't raw to me
give me a mellow beat and a bassline
rhymes combined make you move your waistline
so listen as the rhyme is said
but you don't have to dance , just bop your head
daddy u's as smooth as smooth can get
bodies movin , it proves that the groove's a hit
a vocal tone don't get no crisper
loud and clear even if i whisper
so give me a slow pace , beat with a low bass
and pass the mic and i ain't goin no place
i won't fatigue , take a pause , or retire
energy flows to me from a microphone wire
soon as it's plugged up , couples are hugged up
touch the u ? boy , you must be drugged up
cause fake mc's , enemies , and foes
i just smack em and watch em fall like dominos
