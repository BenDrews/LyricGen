pick up the pace , speed it up fast and faster
keep the cuts crisp and clean , and then blast the
bass till impact is unbearable
and i'ma do mc's somethin terrible
cause i like to start shit off with a bang
cliches and slang that no man can hang
with , the one your girl shares her putang with
and jimmy's what a stick that thang with
you can't stand the pressure and pain when you're put in heat
you felt defeat , so you cheat and still couldn't beat
the vocal phenomenon , word is bond , the u's a don
i correspond and strike like a python
fast and furious , foes find it frightening
the bass is thunder , rhymes strike like lightning
kay on the set and doc throw the samples on
anyone who step in my path'll get trampled on
save all the talk , keep it under your hat
you ain't sayin nothin slick , so go head with that
or i take your space , replace your face , erase your trace
in case you wanna base , pick up the pace
ready , are you ready ? ( are you ready ? )
i speak and peak a verbal crescendo
play mc's like a game of nintendo
clear the board , and then switch the cartridge
hold em hostage and fry em like a sausage
so this advice , i think you should take
those who fake and flake face a break
for goodness sake , i go and flow , do a show solo
touch the pro - hell no , you must be on alcohol
so keep your distance before you get your head flown
for tryin to touch a microphone when you shoulda known
better , it's time to settle a vendetta
it ain't y - o - u , it's one letter
i'm growin and flowin and hoein
and clockin dough and showin
i break backs like a wild samoan
i freeze mc's and leave competetors comatose
lyrics are so dope , the listeners overdose
but everytime i turn , another sucker bit
so i'ma drop em just for the fuck of it
the u comin first place in a race
while kay deejay and play , i say : pick up the pace
it's like magic the way the rhyme flows
smoother and smoother as time goes
on , soft and warm like the quiet storm
cause this is poetry in the highest form
so check the technique , if you just said weak
methods or efforts , then check till next week
you won't find one , son , cause there ain't none
rhymes are artwork , now watch me paint one
colorful rays in the shades of a rainbow
can't estimate the rate of my brainflow
is it fast or is it slow ?
if you wanna know
then pick up the pace
straight off the top i step and then take yours
money , your jewels , and even your girl's drawers
you took a loss , so learn to accept it
cause if you were swift , then you woulda kept it
rick holds the dustpan while i sweep up
tired mc's that could not keep up
with rhymes the u kick , the pace is too quick
rick with the suits and kay with the chew stick
what i recite will keep the whole place hype
raps are capsules , the mic is a basepipe
inhale the smoke , one toke you choke
and bums look for crumbs when the mic is broke
females slave and crave to get next to this
lyrics i kick are fierce as the exorcist
helter skelter , mc's run for shelter
kay'll melt the belts , and i'ma swelter
any mc who step in my face
cause the rhymes are good to go , so yo , pick up the pace
