oh , ah - ah
oh , ah - ah
you claw , you fight , you lose
got a doll that looks just like you
remember when we used to say
" i love you " almost every day
i saw the light in you , ya know
going out as i close our window
you never liked me anyway
aye yeah , aye yeah
aye , i don't see the light i saw in you before
and no , i don't
and no , i don't
and no , i don't care anymore
( now you’ll never know )
baby , believe me
and you had every chance
you destroy everything that you know
( uncontrollable )
if you don't need me
just let me go
you hate , you bite , you lose
after all , i just don't like you
it's nice that you say you like me
but only conditionally
your voice , it had the perfect glow
it got lost when you gave it up though
cause you want money , you want fame
aye yeah , aye yeah
aye , i don't see the light i saw in you before
and no , i don't
and no , i don't
and no , i don't care anymore
( now you’ll never know )
baby , believe me
and you had every chance
you destroy everything that you know
( uncontrollable )
if you don't need me
just let me go
ooh , ooh
hey , hey , sing along , baby
then your heart beats on this sad song
underground , underneath me
and the big things we could’ve had
hey , hey , oh no
( then your heart beats underground now )
( now you’ll never know )
baby , believe me
( then your heart beats underground now )
and you had every chance
you destroy everything that you know
( then your heart beats underground now )
( uncontrollable )
if you don't need me
( then your heart beats underground now )
just let me go
( then your heart beats underground now )
baby , believe me
and you had every chance
you destroy everything that you know
( uncontrollable )
if you don't need me
just let me go
( then your heart beats underground now )
( now you’ll never know )
ah
( then your heart beats underground now )
ah
( uncontrollable )
ah
