get up , this is what i see
when we were young , we used to get so close to it
and you were scared and you were beautiful
i wanna peer over the edge and see in death
if we are always the same
oh , i fear that no life will ever be like this again
cause your love kept me alive and it made me insane , oh , yeah
there were moments when it seemed okay
( but i go back alone )
where do you go ? oh , where do you stay ?
( i go back alone )
there was a time when the music would play
woah - oh - oh - oh - oh
oh , baby , every morning there are mountains to climb
taking all my time
oh , when i get up , this is what i see
welcome to reality
oh , baby , every morning there are mountains to climb
taking all my time
oh , when i get up , this is what i see
welcome to reality

it sounds like corporate art
break bread with an infidel
and plunge into the dark
