epic rap battles of history !
rick grimes !
versus !
walter white !
begin !
carl , stay back , this is gonna get bad
i'm 'bout show this lab rat how to be a real dad
a grade - a mc who will ruin your a1 day
cause sheriff grimes rhymes dirty like my armpit stains
i'm a post - apocalyptic cop who's got a lot of issues
pop a cap in you and splatter the brain you misuse
cooking up blue sky and bigger lies for skyler
hatching little schemes like a dying macgyver
you tore your family apart sin by sin
where i live , it happens literally limb from limb
so write this down in your pancakes so you won't forget it
i kill zombies that are better men than you before breakfast
i don't know what you think i've done
but if we were to battle , i've already won
ask gus , you don't wanna face off against me
i'll stuff you in a barrel and make a dude smoothie ( huaugh ! )
your sense of duty gets your group into some deep doody
always getting saved by some samurai booty
i'm a kingpin cookin' crystal in the middle of the day
having dinner by the pool with the dea
run you over with my aztek ; gta
if you ever try to stop heisenberg gettin' paid
here's a hot dose , let me watch you choke on the truth
you look up to me like i'm a pizza on the roof
cause you're a loser , a failure to your whole entire crew
i've seen walter jr. handle walkers better than you
carl ! i said stay back with the others
while i finish this bitch like you finished your mother
you ain't the danger to me , walt , so knock all you want
i'll watch you get eaten on my fuckin' front lawn
your monsters don't frighten me , and you can bite me
i'll be standing right here in my tighty walter whities ( huaugh ! )
i'll bury you faster than your partner stole your whole life
no one saw shane coming except for your wife
who won ?
who's next ?
you decii...
augh... ahhh... auuuughhhh , ahh
auhhh - epic rap battles of history !
