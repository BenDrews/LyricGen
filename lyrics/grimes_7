this , this music makes me cry
it sounds just like my soul
oh , i'm not ready to win
oh lord , cause i don't wanna know what they say
cause i get carried away
commodifying all the pain
the things they see in me , i cannot see myself
when you get bored of me , i'll be back on the shelf
and when the ocean rises up above the ground
maybe i'll drown in...
california
you only like me when you think i'm looking sad
california
i didn't think you'd end up treating me so bad
oh ( ah - ah - ah )
come monday , it's a dream ( ah - ah - ah )
broken my own heart again
chasing something beautiful
oh lord , but i don't understand what they say
cause i get carried away
commodifying all the pain
the things they see in me , i cannot see myself
when you get bored of me , i'll be back on the shelf
and when the ocean rises up above the ground
maybe i'll drown in...
california
you only like me when you think i'm looking sad
california
i didn't think you'd end up treating me so bad
california
you only like me when you think i'm looking sad
california
i didn't think you'd end up treating me so bad
oh , i , oh , i
oh na , na , na , ne
