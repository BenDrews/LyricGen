big beats , black cloud
get it wrong , get loud
write a song , get down
and everyone will know
and everyone will know
and everyone can go
oh , then , get lost
take his shit , maybe not
listen good , he's gone
everything you know
and everyone should go
oh - oh - oh - oh
i don't need to know
so , do you want to ?
am i just right ? ( is it just right ? )
can you see the enemy just isn't me tonight ?
oh , it is perfect
you could be anything out there
butterflies flying in the air
oh , no , it came
higher than an aeroplane
don't know this song
sweeter than a sugar cane
why you looking for a harmony ?
there is harmony in everything
it’s a butterfly whose wings span the world
on your way , getting caught up
quit and sell livestock
heck , get late , old body
got you moving slow
and everyone will know
and everyone can go
big bird , dimming
wish i could save them
don't know , no plan
everyone can go
and nobody can know
and nobody can know
i don't need to know
so , do you want to ?
am i just ( am i just ? )
can you see the enemy just isn't me ?
oh , baby , it is perfect
you could be anything out there
butterflies flying in the air
oh , no , it came
higher than an aeroplane
don't know this song
sweeter than a sugar cane
why you looking for a harmony ?
there is harmony in everything
it’s a butterfly whose wings span the world
so fly away
if you're looking for a dream girl
i'll never be your dream girl
living in the real world
looking for a dream girl
oh , no , it came
higher than an aeroplane
don't know this song
sweeter than a sugar cane
why you looking for a harmony ?
there is harmony in everything
it’s a butterfly whose wings span the world
so fly away
if you're looking for a dream girl
i'll never be your dream girl
