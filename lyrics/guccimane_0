i'm in an all - red drop tarantula , fuck a challenger
damn these hoes ain't got no manners , bruh , where's the manager ?
i keep throwing rubber bandies up , hoe , pull your panties up
cause you fuck like a granny fuck , you're just an amateur

i look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
but you ain't gotta fuck with me , my nig , but you're stuck with me
but how you called the cops on me , my nig ? you grew up with me
i don't usually do this unless i'm drunk or i'm high
but i'm both right now , got me talking about my life
i don't usually do this unless i'm drunk or i'm high
but i'm both right now
i don't usually do this unless i'm drunk or i'm high

i don't usually do this unless i'm drunk or i'm high

man , i said that i would do it and i did
used to get left - overs out the fridge
nobody was famous where i lived
till i got it jumping at the crib
took a lot to be able to give , i mean
i don't usually do this unless i'm drunk or i'm high
but i'm both right now , got me talking about my life
i don't usually do this unless i'm drunk or i'm high
but i'm both right now
i don't usually do this unless i'm drunk or i'm high
but i'm both right now and i need ya in my life
i don't usually do this unless i'm drunk or i'm high
but i'm both right now
