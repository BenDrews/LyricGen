life is a test many quest the universe
and through my research , i felt the joy and the hurt
the first shall be last and the last shall be first
the basic instructions before leaving earth
knowledge this wisdom , this goes back when i was twelve
i loved doing right but i was trapped in hell
had mad ideas , sad eyes and tears
years of fears , but yo my foes couldn't bear
i searched for the truth since my youth
and went to church since birth , but it wasn't worth the loot
that i was paying , plus the praying
i didn't like staying cuz of busy - bodies and dizzy hotties
that the preacher had souped up with lies
had me cooped up lookin at loot , butt , and thighs
durin the service , he swallowed up the poor
and after they heard this , they wallowed on the floor
but i ignored , and explored my history that was untold
and watched mysteries unfold
and dropped a jewel like solomon , but never followed men
cause if you do your brain is more hollow than
space oblivia , or the abyss
with no trace of trivia , left with the hiss
does it pay to be deaf , dumb and blind ?
from a slave we was kept from the mind
and from the caves he crept from behind
and what he gave , was the sect of the swine
when the bible , it condemned the pig
i don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs
but we used to wear a turban , but now we're in the urban
no more wearing beanies and dress like a genie
no hocus pocus cause i focus on the facts
and put it on the tracks and brought it through the wax
i speak on jacob , it might take up some time
and too much knowledge , it might break up the rhyme
i did it anyway just to wake up the mind
of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet
those who sit home , or sell books by the market
need to chill and get their mind revived
for years religion did nothing but divide
the basic instructions before leaving earth
i strolled through the books of job to unfold
and open bibles , instead of hoping on revivals
calling on his name and screaming hallelujah
when he hardly knew ya , that's how the devil's fooled ya
see look into my eyes brethren , that's the lies of a reverend
why should you die to go to heaven ?
the earth is already in space , the bible i embraced
a difficult task i had to take
i studied till my eyes was swollen , and only arose when
i found out that we were the chosen
i deal with the truth , and build with the youth
and teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
son , life is a pool of sin , corrupted with foolish men
and women with wicked minds , who build picket signs
to legalize abortion , the evil eye distortion
i quiz son with my wisdom
before i converted , i was perverted , and knowledge was asserted
the study of wisdom , i perferred it
the understanding , it gave me mental freedom
i even learnt caucasians were really the tribe of edom
the white image , of christ , is really cesare borgia
and uhh , the second son of pope alexander
the sixth of rome , and once the picture was shown
that's how the devils tricked my dome
i prophesized to save a man , but no one gave a damn
for my nation - the seed of abraham
blessed with the tongue of hebrew
now we're strung on needles , and some are plungin evils
so study and be wise in these days of darkness
peace to my nephew marcus
