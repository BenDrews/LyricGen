aiyo shorty , yo that's my word
oh , y'all smelling y'all piss now y'all think y'all gold
yo anybody get caught flinging over here
i'm returning 'em , that's my word they getting blasted
anything from 220 to 140 , that's mine
y'all need to step the fuck off
y'all niggas ain't crazy for real
yo , the fiends ain't coming fast enough
there is no cut that's pure enough
i can't fold , i need gold , i re - up and reload
product must be sold to you
i'm deep down in the back streets , in the heart of medina
about to set off something more deep than a misdemeanor
under the subway , waiting for the train to make noise
so i can blast a nigga and his boys , for what ?
he pushed up on the block and made the dope sales drop
like the crash in the dow jones stock
i had a connect to cross - sales , to catch more mill's
than ho - bitches got birth control pills
i'm in the park setting up a deal over blunt fire
bum nigga sleeping on the bench , they had him wired
peeped my convo , the address of my condo
and how i changed a nigga name to john doe
and while we set up camp , we got vamped
put the stake through his heart , i ripped his fucking fangs apart
snake got smoked on the set like brandon lee
blown out the frame like pan am flight 103
he got swung on , his lungs was torn
a kingpin just castled with his rook and lost a pawn
a regular on the block that played lookout
for preying predator with a glock , he should have took out
no neighbourhood is rough enough
there is no clip that's full enough
i can't fold , i need gold , i re - up and reload
product must be sold to you
fiends ain't coming fast enough
there is no cut that's pure enough
i can't fold , i need gold , i re - up and reload
product must be sold to you
it's mandatory that i supply all my troops with mega firearms
big apes and spread 'em out like crops on a farm
to get cream , sometimes they repaint the scene
like the last episode on gates , and other niggas
plant bombs till the smoke from the blast becomes thick
and flows through , all they knew , he's gun sick
his glock clicks like high - heeled shoes on parquet floors
mad sick , stand on hills and invade wars
filthy foul , shovelling dirt , he's out to hurt
for instance , chop off hands , attack worth
his idols would lock down airports and extort
some import , catching ten percent of what the fiends snort
up in the ski resorts , up in hills
they move keys and had the skis making drops on snowmobiles
the plan was to expand , catch seven figures , release triggers
and live large and bigger than my nigga
who promised his moms a mansion with mad room
she died and he still put a hundred grand in her tomb
open wounds , he hid behind closed doors
and still organizes crime and drug wars
fiends ain't coming fast enough
there is no cut that's pure enough
i can't fold , i need gold , i re - up and reload
product must be sold to you
no neighborhood is rough enough
there is no clips that's full enough
i can't fold , i need gold , i re - up and reload
product must be sold to you
there's no cuffs that's tight enough
there is no niggas that's fuck with us
i can't fold , i need gold , i re - up and reload
product must be sold to you
