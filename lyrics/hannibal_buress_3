comedy is fun but i really , i really want to be a firefighter
i want to be a firefighter so i can drive the fire suv
cause i don't know what the fire suv does when they get to the fire
like - - - -
yep that's a fire
confirmed that is a fire , yup
well i guess we gotta sit here and wait for the firetruck
so they can put some water on that shit , cause this is just a chevy blazer...
we do not have a water hose those people gon burn up until the firetruck gets here
that's sad and unfortunate , what's on the radio
the dude in the fire suv is just the boss
which has gotta be pretty easy to direct people when you dealing with fire
" hey guys right there where there's that fire " " yeah "
" i'd like for you to put some water on that shit , consistently until there's no more fire.
and we're gonna go with the same approach right here , we're gonna put water on the fire
until there's no more fire "
they probably had meetings in the morning
" i wanna , guys i wanna call everybody's attention to the board right here
hypothetically , if it's fire right here , we want to put water on the fire , until there's no more fire
we're gonna go with a similar strategy right here , put water on the fire until there's no more fire
because that's what we do we're goddamn firefighters "
i bet they had the same agenda for every meeting but they just whiteout the date
write over it , to save paper...
