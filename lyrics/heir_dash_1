woah woah woah
went to a show last saturday night
the band was doing their thing
the moshpit started , and then the crowd parted
and there was kiki dee
knew this girl back in junior high school
when nobody gave her a look
look at what we got , the girl got hot
switched up and rewrote the book
satin tights , boots so white
leather handbag out of sight
what used to mean a little
now means a lot
oh my goodness me
the girl got hot
woah woah woah
the first thing i did when i got up the nerve
was say , " hey baby , what's up ? " ( what up ? )
she kept on dancing , refused my romancing
and that's when i fell in love
i stepped to the floor with her best friend jill
and tried to thicken the plot
the thing i finally found with these other girls in town
she got hot , they did not
nah nah nah...
satin tights , boots so white
leather handbag out of sight ( out of sight )
regal feather in her feathered hair
dash of rouge , buyer beware
what used to mean a little
now means a lot
oh my goodness me
the girl got hot
