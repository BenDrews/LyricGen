just glance from behind
happened by chance or design
the perfume she wore
took me back through a door
i had closed long ago
suddenly
i thought it was you
thought it was you
thought it was you
thought it was you
remember what we knew
i thought it was you
thought it was you
thought it was you
remember when i thought it was you
we were young love was new
warm as the sun shining through
in your arms it seemed
i went back to a dream
i had seen long ago
suddenly
i thought it was you
thought it was you
thought it was you
thought it was you
remember what we knew
i thought it was you
thought it was you
thought it was you
remember when i thought it was you
