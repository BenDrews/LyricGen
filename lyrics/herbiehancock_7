j.l. :
in this proud land , we grew up strong
we were wanted all along
i was taught to fight , taught to win
i never thought i could fail
no fight left or so it seems
i am a man whose dreams have all deserted
i've changed my face , i've changed my name
but no one wants you when you lose
p. :
don't give up
'cause you have friends
don't give up
you're not beaten , yet
don't give up
i know you can make it good
j.l. :
though i saw it all around
never thought i could be affected
thought that we'd be the last to go
it is so strange the way things turn
drove the night toward my home
the place that i was born , on the lakeside
as daylight broke , i saw the earth
the trees had burned down to the ground
p. :
don't give up
you still have us
don't give up
we don't need much of anything , no
don't give up
'cause somewhere there's a place where we belong
rest your head
you worry too much
it's gonna be alright
both :
when times get rough
you can fall back on us
p. :
don't give up
oh , please , please , don't give up
j.l. :
got to walk out of here
i can't take anymore
gonna stand on that bridge
keep my eyes down below
both :
whatever may come
and whatever may go
that river's flowing
ooh , that river's flowing
j.l. :
moved on to another town
tried hard to settle down
for every job , so many men
so many men no one needs
p. :
don't give up
'cause you have friends
don't give up
you're not the only one
don't give up
no reason to be ashamed
don't give up
you still have us
j.l. :
mm , don't give up
p. :
don't give up now
we're proud of who you are
don't give up
you know it's never been easy
don't give up
no matter what you do
don't give up
'cause i believe there's a place
there's a place where we belong
don't give up
