god don't leave me , i'll freeze
i panic in my bedroom half asleep
god don't tempt me i'm weak
a needle is a shitty way to leave
creator of my awful mind
you crossed the line this time
it's been a long time
since the phone rang and it was you
god don't leave me , i'll freeze
if only but a second of your time
god , don't leave me , i'll freeze
like the last summer
