lover , where do you live
in the sky , in the clouds , in the ocean
i learned the lesson about bad ideas
we're really out in the middle of it now
and if i ever see you again , my love
all i'm ever gonna do
is send shivers down that spine of yours
it would be nice to come home , i guess
to a couch , and a stove and a backyard
lover , where do you live
in the sky , in the clouds , in the ocean
and if i ever see you again , my love
all i'm ever gonna do
is send shivers down that spine of yours
and if i ever see you again , my love
all i'm ever gonna do
is send shivers down that spine of yours
all i'm ever gonna do
is send shivers down that spine of yours
if i ever see you again , my love
if i ever see you again , my love
if i ever see you again , my love
lover , where do you live
in the sky , in the clouds , in the ocean
