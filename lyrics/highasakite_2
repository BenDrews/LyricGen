god , if you're still watching
there are no more happy days
god , if you're still watching
there's no more celebration
love , i need a ride
i need a proper high
love , i'm on your side
but we were never good , no
boy , can you hear me now ?
i've got a golden ticket , i'm out
boy , can you hear me shout ?
i've got a golden ticket , i'm out
i'm already gone , i'm out
i'm already gone , i'm out
love , i need a light
i need a proper high
god , i really tried
but we were never good , no
boy , can you hear me now ?
i got a golden ticket , i'm out
boy , can you hear me shout ?
i got a golden ticket , i'm out
i'm already gone , i'm out
i'm already gone , i'm out
i have been madness
i have been war
i have been reckless
i have been sore
i have been silence
i have been bored
i have been vibrant
i have been bored
i have been madness
i have been war
i have been sadness
i've got a golden ticket...
i've got a golden ticket...
boy , can you hear me now ?
i've got a golden ticket , i'm out
boy , can you hear me shout ?
i've got a golden ticket , i'm out
i'm already gone , i'm out
i'm already gone , i'm out
i'm already gone , i'm out
i got a golden ticket , i'm out
