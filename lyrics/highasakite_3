my name is liar
and i'm friends with sin
i am on fire
and broken from within
enemies of freedom
freedom itself is under attack
i want it to be like lances
and swords confronting the enemies
i am one with what i am
an alliance with a liar
like idiots
my name is sorrow
and i am sharing sheets with shame
i have no sense of honour
and i am not the one to blame
i am one with what i am
an alliance with a liar
like idiots
my love is liar
i'm in love with fire
counting the numbers
and when i'm up to seven
i have no insides
you have no molecules
an alliance with a liar
like idiots
