i am leaving
i'm unleashing
i unravel
to the leeches
i'm unpleasant
i'm not loving
i'm not listening
i'm not talking
i untangle
to the speechless
i'm obnoxious
i'm not loving
just call out the guys
with the samurai swords
someone else
will love like a rainstorm
someone else
will drown in your long strong arms
i'm not present at all
i don't know how that feels
i'm not flawless
i'm not cautious
i am blazing
out the houses
i am poison
i'm not loving
i'm not focused
i'm not stable
there's no patience
no salvation
there's no heartache
i'm not loving
just call out the guys
with the samurai swords
someone else
will love like a rainstorm
someone else
will drown in your long strong arms
i'm not present at all
i don't know how that feels
just call out the guys
with the samurai swords
someone else
will love like a rainstorm
someone else
will drown in your long strong arms
i'm not present at all
i don't know how that feels
