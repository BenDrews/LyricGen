i was lust i was inside the earth
they call me faker
but it takes one to know one , dear
i was blood , i was unbreakable
they call me satan
but it takes one to know one , dear
i , i am not the one
likely to dress up a sympathy
i , i am not the one , not me
i have no empathy
cause i still got those scars on my knees
i am my own disease
it's your life or it's his
so you're gonna fight so hard
and helicopters
screaming over your head at night
it's your loss or it's his
so you , you gonna smoke him out
and when the flash comes
i see bones through my fingertips
i , i am not the one
likely to dress up a sympathy
i , i am not the one , not me
i have no empathy
cause i still got those scars on my knees
i am my own disease
i , i am not the one likely
i , i am not the one , not me
i , i am not the one
likely to dress up a sympathy
i , i am not the one , not me
i have no empathy
cause i still got those scars on my knees
i am my own disease
i was dust i was unbreakable
they call me satan
but it takes one to know one , dear
