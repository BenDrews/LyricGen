the earth is the universes eyes
the earth is the universes eyes
and you set out for peace but got nuclear war
and bashed in the eyes of them all
the earth is the universes eyes
the earth is the universes eyes
and it hasn't been viewed since before the attack
and none has been watching us by
oh i used to smother his pride
and he lifted me by the hair
oh i used to smother his pride
he was dragging me down the stairs
leaving no traces the eye can see
the night has a thousand eyes
the night has a thousand eyes
and you squeezed my heart and punctured my lung
and that weapon would soon replace your tongue
the night has a thousand eyes
the night has a thousand eyes
and you've wandered a lot through the southern ends of hearts
and that weapon would soon replace your tongue
oh i used to smother his pride
and he lifted me by the hair
oh i used to smother his pride
he was dragging me down the stairs
oh i used to smother his pride
and he lifted me by the hair
oh i used to smother his pride
he was dragging me down the stairs
leaving no traces the eye can see
leaving no traces the eye can see
oh i used to smother his pride
and he lifted me by the hair
oh i used to smother his pride
he was dragging me down the stairs
oh i used to smother his pride
and he lifted me by the hair
oh i used to smother his pride
he was dragging me down the stairs
leaving no traces the eye can see
the earth is the universes eyes
the earth is the universes eyes
