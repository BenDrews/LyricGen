send somebody to me alive
send somebody vital
send someone not likely to die
send someone who's vital
send a fighter
send somebody to me tonight
send somebody bolder
send someone not likely to break
send someone who's older
send a soldier
tonight is all you've got you told me
there's no more everyday
tonight is all and then it's over
there's no more everyday
send a soldier
someone who'll get it
that's all
send somebody out of his mind
send a goddamn leader
send someone not psycho polite
send some goddamn freedom
someone breathing
tonight is all you've got you told me
there's no more everyday
tonight is all and then it's over
there's no more everyday
send a soldier
someone who'll get it
that's all
send a soldier
