i am not the one
you should be hospitalising
there is a man that should be locked up
no , i'm not the one
who should be brainwashed and handled
there is a spy
that should be caught by the handle
i am the darkness of your life
i am not the one
who would do bondage in handcuffs
i am the god you should bow down for
i am the darkness of your life
deep sea diver
it is nobody's business but my own
i am not the one to slash my wrists
cause you're leaving
i am what you call holly golightly
i am the darkness of your life
i am not a gender , not a man nor a woman
i could be all or nothing at all
i am the darkness of your life
deep sea diver
it is nobody's business but my own
