i think the incompetence of the obama administration in the way they’ve handled these kinds of affairs like syria in the middle east , is one of the worst aspects of this presidency. if you’re a friend and ally of the united states in that part of the world tonight , you’d have to say what’s this guy all about ? can we count on anything he’s told us ? … at the same time , our adversaries out there no longer fear us.

hillary clinton clearly wasn’t hands on , and now she doesn’t want to be hands on. and she’s doing everything she can to avoid responsibility for what clearly fell into her bailiwick. i think the benghazi thing is one of the great — it’s not just an embarrassment , it’s a tragedy , because we lost four people that night. and what i always recall is her testimony saying , ‘what difference does it make ? ’ and the fact of the matter is it makes a huge difference.”
