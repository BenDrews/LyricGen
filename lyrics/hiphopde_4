i - - - - i ve had u by my side
when my thoughts were turning
the negative had me burning
you are my perfect get away
since i've had u i could neva lose u
lose you
with this i had to write you
express to u
it's time that you see
how you ve changed my history
its my greats dream with my face on magazines
and mom smiling at me joy in my eyes just to see her smile
it been a long time since i really seen her smile
promises i made and some unspoken
to do my best to make her proud i ride with the realist
some call us killers , roller coaster da game that we all call life
music is all i see , trust is all i need
i play these keys , to stimulate your mind , and remind you once you rockin’ wit i
if looking for greatness then you looking i
you won’t beef then i need it super - size
you against me that’s suicide
suicide man that's suicide. if you didn’t know you rocking wit i
