my momma raised me up in the era when
papa was gone
he was servin' coke and heroin
writin' raps , you woulda thought i had help
but niggas frontin'
fuck it , i'll just keep these beats for myself
you see , it's broke nigga hatin'
that's the internet shit , talkin' on the low
and it's rich nigga hatin'
that's don't let him in , that nigga might blow
all i want's some money , some hoes , and champagne
a boat , some smoke , fur coats
slick rick chains and a damn plane
gotta put on for my niggas
whippin' without the pain
so i'm spending everything
just to look good with my gang
new chains
so i guess we the new slaves
new chains bitch
you see it's beamers
and it's honda , love
only one'll get the fucked
the other , not as much
you see , it's ninas and it's monicas
both crazy 'bout the dick , so they swallow nuts
lobster , mac and cheese , and fire weed
that's the combination
it's the fucking house of hit
that hailing satan congregation
hallelujah , halleluhjah
we just brought in three more cases
kkkin' bottles of dark
thought the whole party was racist
i'm workin' hard for a check
just to put it on my neck
a nigga with a new chain
now that's that james somersett
now that's that james somersett , now that's that james somersett
a nigga with a new chain
now that's that james somersett
but fuck it
i know you've seen baby on tv
cause i've seen him too
watchin' 'em too
wishin' that was me and my crew
real life ghetto kings , my stuntin' idols
i understood what that message was
cash money was them fly niggas
i wanted everything except the love
soon as my cake up , i'm going straight up to jacob
and i'mma spend it all
blowin' everything that i was supposed to save up
now jesus had skin to bronze
so i pay my tithe that was owed
and used the rest of my green
to turn my jesus into gold
i turn my jesus into gold , i turn my jesus into gold
so either way we're still slavin'
just hanging from a different rope
this just my song of honesty
nigga , fuck your philosophy
gotta ball out by any means
even if it's at the swap meet
you know where ben baller be
we know them hoes wanna see , we know them hoes wanna see
nigga , we'll get fresh before we eat
so no , don't sweat the technique
i'm tryin' shine like eric b
i'm tryin' floss like rakim
so i'm spending everything from my deal , bitch
