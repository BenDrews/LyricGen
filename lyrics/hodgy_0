i'm never alone ; it's me , myself and this misery
darkness despite the 5/8 glitteries
plug me in like i'm the new kinect ( 360 - xbox )
yeah , plug me in like i'm the new connect , slanging crack rock
under the influence , underrated , my booth a sweatshop
hang towels and tank tops on my sony c800
doctor tell me to quit , enzymes rising in my liver
but that's where me and him differ , nigga , i am not a quitter
half the time , mind's in the shitter , i'm in the clouds , i hear the scriptures
most of us don't love to be givers , pretty swell listeners , providing for those relying
you can't define who you are , give fine line print refinement
motives for better timing , my motive's forever rhyming
i open the forum for them , they're waiting for me to chime in
and say what i said , simon
i'm debating if i should sign in
i'm never alone ; it's me , myself , and my son
i'm up before the sun for my son , that's my number one priority
majority of people are minority ; underhanded , i understand it
being taken advantage of ain't the best feeling , is it ?
the actions are found through anger , named it concealed imprisonment
i'm trying to implement the simple shit , not hoping for episodes of incidents
which is prevalent without a settlement
i'm heaven - sent , hell bound , fresher than luxury with lemon scent
and peppermints , leather , tints , rev the 6 series
beep the horn and see if she can hear a bitch clearly
make a bamboo earring , got her name in cursive in the center
a self - centered woman with no room for you to enter on her vagina's agenda
got my name embedded , permanent henna
i'll forget the times we had , will find another to resemble her
there's always that somebody
could you possibly be that somebody , that's - uhh
watching , learning , scheming , turning tables
there's always somebody , there's always that
could possibly be that somebody , behind your back
watching , learning , scheming , turning tables
y'knamsayin ?
nowadays you just gotta watch your back , baby
i mean , you gotta watch your back like you got two backs
you feel me ? can't be trusting these motherfuckers
they all scheming , man. all they want is your motherfucking paper , your motherfucking talent , whatever you got , man
don't give up your independence , nigga
and your motherfucking mind and that's all you got , y'nahmean ?
besides your word
