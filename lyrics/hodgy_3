( kids voice : yooo , yoo , yoo )
i tell a little homie , this is life
i tell these cute bitches , get right
light a blunt for everybody , get high
everything is gonna be alright
i'm lyin' on a landslide
with a bag of california to smoke
an ounce of shrooms for nature walks -
and hide and toss invited some of my folks
the ones that was here before the fame
and blame the world for bringing us so close
family's , build family trees , grow apple - trees
and that's what matters the most
( west side )
my stompin' ground , i'm stompin' round in my black vans
mellowhype on my jersey , tattoos on my black hands
ridin' up in that chevrolet , smoke weed , everyday
rest in peace , to that nigga nate
you fuck niggas , you can't relate
all my niggas up in this bitch
reppin' golfwang , you ain't even know it
we smokin' on that bama - weed , you ain't even grow it
bitch im on your mind , tell me how it feel
bitch im on your mind , tell me how it feel
i tell a little homie , this is life
i tell these cute bitches , get right
light a blunt for everybody , get high
everything is gonna be alright
