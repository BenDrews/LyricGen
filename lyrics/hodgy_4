if heaven's a ghetto , i want to live in the suburbs
where the two - way streets have lovebirds
i'm minimizing my cuss words
no absurd , crip in the blood work or knowing how a gun work
drugs , church , surrounded by my upbringing
pops ain't the one providing , at six i'm up singing
this is my contribution of what's bringing the luck
of the child in the truck when he shows up breathing
they never heard of heat when he used to speak
or exquisite , no requisite for appetite
spit like an athlete , produce like an apple tree
and this bastard be casket - free
fuck roses , when i die i want a photo shoot
that lasting greatness you'll document , i'm opulent
yeah the opposite gon' cop a sit , sick while i drop a shit
i'm out this bitch , nigga , i'm calculate
niggas tell me i fail , i bounce back off of that
send your hate through the mail , i bounce back off of that
you don't see me in jail , i'm at home taking naps
full course meal , no scraps
