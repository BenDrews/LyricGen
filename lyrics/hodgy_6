somebody loves you baby oh oh oh
somebody loves you baby
( repeat x3 )
i feel the beat in my heart , other niggas pump their brains
give me the dankest strain , i'll hop into my paper plane
niggas run they mouth , shit i do the same
the only difference is i'm getting it bitches
cause money , addiction , the addict is unrestricted to the
life that i'm living , man , the life that i was given
was purposely handed to me , i swear it was granted to me
i'm rose gold frozen my nigga , you granite to me , uh
that was what i call a fun time punch line
with your bitch in the summer time , and guess what she under mines
under minded , you have to underline it
illiterate triple six is what the fucking time is ( golf wang )
i flow so hard you can't tell if my dick is gonna bust
i'm sick i need that robituss' and that lobster stroganoff
i'm faded , chauffeured up , smoking up , rolling up another dutch
amsterdam where the women are dutch , freaks that don't talk much
redheads gimme that bedhead , i told becky to give me that redneck
and i'm rocking my " nigga " hat , like ya nigga bad
and my nigga's strapped , gun shot wit' it
gun shot wit' it , gun shot wit' it
i'mma be a fucking legend like 2pac and biggie
sending smoke signals to the heavens , tell the lord to come and get me
or a higher power to arrive in a hour
i gotta smoke this ounce up , put my shades on let's bounce y'all
