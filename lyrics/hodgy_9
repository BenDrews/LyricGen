save all your letters and drop your tomatoes
hodgy beats , where he ? looking for a large payroll
not dimes , nickels , pennies , pesos
i'm tryna stack chips nigga , peelin' my potatoes
if i'm not the biggest boss that you've see thus far
take a look at the exquisite luxury cars
big ponts being stuck into a cuban cigar
promethazine on the leaf only to get bizarre
we don't go to the club nigga , we post at the bar
have conversation with girls that don't know who we are
with diamonds in our ears , looking like cube stars
i live a matrix life and we cruise hard
and i swear i'm a fiend , dope fiend , i'm an addict
crack music going hard , odd future got a bag it
yeah , make it stretch like bubble gum
eh , all the little females like yummy yum
now ugly girls get out , the light skinned girls about
without a doubt you niggas don't amount to shit , no need to count
now bring the ruler out like rick the ruler paid in full
i'm cooler than your cooler , got these hoes , now where's my garden tool
fuck 'em all , all them fuck with the future
i back with thrash hard backyard beach cruiser , look
you niggas can't contain the thoughts that's flowin' in my brain
it synthesizes schitzo neutron from steering paper plane
and the white girls love me and the haters shove me
and push me until i beat the pussy up like it was ugly
and that's without the loot , niggas take the time to tune
the diamond dolla's , bitch i'm complex like einstein's rubix cube
look , i'm the truth , now stop daring me
niggas kill yourself and decide to go back to therapy
and my right is right , my right is left , my left is wrong
now bitches throw your fucking bras off while i'll be writin' my songs
and i swear i'm a fiend , dope fiend , i'm an addict
crack music going hard , odd future got a bag it
yeah , make it stretch like bubble gum
eh , all the little females like yummy yum
gimme a couple commas while i abreviate
the war between the pen and paper i alleviate
alexander is hodgy , cause i can be the great
as long as i have a hundred mill' in the cheese steak
in a big breifcase like i won a sweepstakes
odd future got money out the ass for g's sakes
i feel like i can fly without wings on my back
this is crack with me , but this crack ain't whack
i got niggas hooked , yeah , the stadium packed
and i flip that like a gymnasium mat
his grind time , and i'm making it stretch
why get less for more when you can get more for less
pure for less , down , five three 18 thousand impression
if you comprehend what i recommend press send
if you comprehend what i recommend , odd future
and i swear i'm a fiend , dope fiend , i'm an addict
crack music going hard , odd future got a bag it
yeah , make it stretch like bubble gum
eh , all the little females like yummy yum
