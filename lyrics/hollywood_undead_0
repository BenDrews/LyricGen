'cause i hate that you breathe

on the front of my arms
the boulevard brass knuckles
in the back of the car
'cause we drunk - drive cadillacs

and when you see us motherfuckers
better know who we are
i got one thing to say
to punk - asses who hate
motherfuckers don't know
but you better watch what you say
from these industry fucks
to these faggot ass punks

i'm getting used to this nuisance
of fags who badmouth this music
how fucking stupid and foolish
of you to think you can do this
you cowards can't you never will
don't even try to pursue it
i took the chance , i paid the bill
i nearly died for this music
you make me wanna run around
pulling my guns out and shit
you're tempting me to run my mouth
and call you out on this bitch
how ignorant you gotta be
to believe any of this
you need to slit your wrists
get pissed and go jump off a bridge
what , you can't see the sarcasm
in the verses i spit ?
what , you think i just got lucky
ddidn't work for this shit ?
bitch i've been working at this
ever since i was a kid
i've played a million empty shows
to only family and friends
what kind of person would diss a band
that deserves to get big ?
i'd hate to be that person
when my verse comes out of their kid's lips
that shit's as worse as it gets
this verse is over i quit
signed " charlie scene "
on your girlfriend's tits !

white boys with tattoos
p - pointing right at you
we're breaking everything
r - rowdy like a classroom
pack of wolves
'cause we don't follow the rules
and when you're running your mouth
our razor blades come out
because there's nothing in my life
except my dick and what i spit
so my dick is in my hand
when i respond to faggots talking shit
speaking of fag
already rapped with the drag
we killed him
then we stuffed his body in the cadillac
b - but you always press ?
and you know i never stress
with loki dms
j - johnny to my left
got phantom and the rest
who are down to rep the west
i grew up on drive - bys
and la gang signs
so what the fuck do you know about
being a gangster ?
and what the fuck do you know about
being in danger ?
you ain't doing this
so you know you're just talking shit
mad at all of us
'cause every song is a fucking hit !
you better get up out the way
tomorrow we'll rise so let's fight today
you know i don't give a fuck what you think or say
'cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway
you better get up out the way
tomorrow we'll rise so let's fight today
