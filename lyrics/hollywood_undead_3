hold on holy ghost
go on , hold me close
better run , here we come
it's the day of the dead
we come from a world
of oblivion , bad dreams
i got all i need
strapped right to my hamstring
i'm not really bad
i'm just made up of bad things
i'm really not a mad man
the voices keep asking
born with a soul
that don't wanna be saved
every time i look around
i see what a fiend made
every time i die
i hope they're digging up my grave
an undead one
like the flag that i wave
i'm not afraid to cry
from this cocaine sickness
i'm not afraid to die
let the good book witness
i ask and give none
nope , no forgiveness
it's the day of the dead
and you're on our hit list
so come all you misfits !
bitch you're on our hit list !
hold on holy ghost !
go on , hold me close !
better run , here we come !
it's the day of the dead !
hold on holy ghost !
so long to the ones you know !
better run , here we come !
it's the day of the dead !
this is exactly what has to be done
it happened so gradually
it's like i magically happened to be
this phantom that candidly...
lets his dagger cut jaggedly
while you're gasping so rapidly
while you gag on this rag
i feed you while laughing so happily
it's okay to get startled
and be afraid of the dark
i'll just wait here to swallow your soul
and tear you apart
and i've already started
there ain't no saving your heart
this is the day of the dead
this ain't no day in the park
here i come , here i come
grab your guns and crossbows
and run , better run
from the skull and crossbones
the fun has begun
yeah , it's hard to swallow
and when i'm done
i ain't done 'cause it's hell that follows
now get ready for sorrow !
'cause it's hell that follows !
hold on holy ghost !
go on , hold me close !
better run , here we come !
it's the day of the dead !
hold on holy ghost !
so long to the ones you know !
better run , here we come !
it's the day of the dead !
when the ashes start to rise
and the moon falls from the sky
and a thousand candles
burn into the night
when the angels softly cry
on the flames below the sky
would a thousand souls
still pray for you and i ?
hold on holy ghost !
go on hold me close !
better run , here we come !
it's the day of the dead !
hold on holy ghost !
go on , hold me close !
better run , here we come !
it's the day of the dead !
hold on holy ghost !
so long to the ones you know !
better run , here we come !
it's the day of the dead !
hold on holy ghost
it's the day of the dead !
hold on holy ghost
it's the day of the dead !
hold on holy ghost
here's to the damned !
it's the day of the dead !
hold on holy ghost
here's to the damned !
it's the day of the dead !
