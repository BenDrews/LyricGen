we are , we are !
we are made from broken parts !
we are , we are !
we are broken from the start !
and our hearts , our hearts !
they were beating in the dark !
'cause we are , we are !
we are built from broken parts !
if you can lose it all
then welcome to broadway
silicone dreams
and your name on the marquee
and i can hold it up
but i hold it up hardly
it's hotter here in hell
but it's getting real dark , see ?
so all you sick
and the bitterness of the lonely
to all you overdosed
and you miles of coke fiends
and every step , another step
you're walking on my dreams
'cause every breath , another breath
you're breathing when i breathe
i watched 'em all come
gotta watch the rest go
i'm married to the devil ,
in the city of angels
so come all you wicked
to the world of the empty
you know i need it all
so baby , don't tempt me
i'm knocking on your door
nope , nobody sent me
just checking all you bitches
like i'm checking this check sheet
so put your hats on
lohner don't get soft
you can see god
when i take my mask off
we are , we are !
we are made from broken parts !
we are , we are !
we are broken from the start !
and our hearts , our hearts !
they were beating in the dark !
'cause we are , we are !
we are built from broken parts !
the fame is your best friend
you love it , no questions
beating down the door
is the face of rejection
and once again
it's a tragedy anthem
we never wanted more
we never needed your blessing
who could give a fuck
about a kid with a dream ?
'cause stories aren't told
about the ones unseen
with a gleam in his eye
his middle finger to the sky
crooked smile on his face
he doesn't think he can die
so grab a pick and an axe
'cause we try , we cry
into the bottle of jack
we die inside
so when you look in his eyes
what you see now ?
murder the monster you've made
then watch him bleed out
we're in a life
where it's kill or lose
just lie motherfucker
till you hear the truth
from under the street
through the gutters of youth
just cry motherfucker
yeah , i'm talking to you
we are , we are !
we are made from broken parts !
we are , we are !
we are broken from the start !
and our hearts , our hearts !
they were beating in the dark !
'cause we are , we are !
we are built from broken parts !
from the city of angels !
an empty vessel of devils !
is there no one to save us ?
through my eyes see the world that you gave us !
from the city of angels !
an empty vessel of devils !
is there no one to save us ?
through my eyes see the world that you gave us !
we are , we are !
we are made from broken parts !
we are , we are !
we are broken from the start !
and our hearts , our hearts !
they were beating in the dark !
'cause we are , we are !
we are built from broken parts !
from the city of angels !
an empty vessel of devils !
is there no one to save us ?
through my eyes see the world that you gave us !
from the city of angels !
an empty vessel of devils !
is there no one to save us ?
through my eyes see the world that you gave us !
