i am a lion
and i want to be free
do you see a lion
when you look inside of me ?
outside the window
just to watch you as you sleep
'cause i am a lion
born from things you cannot be
how can i sleep at night ?
there's a war inside my head
i found a lion hidden right beneath my bed
i will not hide myself
from the tears that you have shed
'cause i am a lion and you are dead
here's a story
of everything we'll ever be
you can hide
but some of us can never leave
and if you go
i don't need those little things
they remind me
of all our little dreams
can you hear the words
all i can say ?
we can watch the world
even if they walk away
forget about tomorrow
tomorrow is today
you were born a lion
and a lion you will stay
i am a lion
and i want to be free !
do you see a lion
when you look inside of me ?
outside the window
just to watch you as you sleep !
'cause i am a lion
born from things you cannot be !
remember an army
of all those little kids ?
living life
like they only get a little bit
it's hard to fight
when you're born in the middle
and i'd rather die
won't watch you giving in
i'm sorry daughter
but your father's not the same
i can look into your eyes
and i'll swear that i will change
but tomorrow is tomorrow
so forgive me if i stay
you can hide beneath the covers
while i hide behind the pain
after all
only so much we can say
words can lose their meaning
once we walk away
promise me that you'll love me
watch me as i fade
i'll give you all the things
that these liars never gave
the hands on the clock
and the things we cannot change
tear it all to pieces
and take back what i made
if there's one thing i'd keep
it's you that i would save
'cause i am just a lion
and a lion i will stay
i am a lion
and i want to be free
do you see a lion
when you look inside of me ?
outside the window
just to watch you as you sleep
'cause i am a lion
born from things you cannot be
hey !
i never meant to let go !
all i want and you're all i ever wanna know !
can't hide in the attic of a pretty home !
of a pretty home !
of a pretty home , hey !
i never meant to let go !
all i want and you're all i ever wanna know !
can't hide in the attic of a pretty home !
of a pretty home !
of a pretty home , hey !
i am a lion
and i want to be free !
do you see a lion
when you look inside of me ?
outside the window
just to watch you as you sleep !
'cause i am a lion
born from things you cannot be !
