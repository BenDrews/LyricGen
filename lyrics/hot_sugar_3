i'm in the cut with bloody knuckles
irony , sight for sore eyes to see
least likely to like to leave
lie to me ( lie to me )
tell me that i'm good and misunderstood
cause the fear ( the fear ) is frightening
and i don't want to be judged
i don't want to be judged
i don't want to be judged
so tell me where the hugs at ?
fuck where the drugs at ?
i'm dying ( dying ) and you're not crying ( crying ) ( louder )
i'm tired of feeling sour
fuck the power , and whoever on it
cause i murder every opponent
i wanna see his mother sob
" why ? " , body hunched over his coffin
like , " why did it go so quick ?
why did that clip slip and make his lip drip bright red ? "
i'm feeling nauseous
vomit up chunks of check mix and light brunch
cause i found out the only virgin here was fruit punch
so what was the point of even blowing up
rolling up , getting blown and such
but never ever ever ever ever ever ( grip the cup )
i guess it's just a myth of song
call them easter bunts
i'm sick of making friends
sick of making amends
i'm sick of women ( women ) thinking that i owe them ( true )
you got your vowels screwed
fuck am i to do
when the message misconstrued
and i end up in the noose
for something i didn't do
so fuck you i'm done talking
i don't want to be judged
i don't want to be judged
so tell me where the hugs at
fuck where the drugs at
i'm dying ( dying ) and your not crying ( crying )
i'm tired of feeling sour
fuck the power
and whoever on it
i don't want to be judged
i don't want to be judged
i don't want to be judged
i don't want to be judged
i don't want to be judged
i don't want to be judged
i don't want to be judged
i don't want to be judged
i don't want to be judged
i don't want to be judged
i don't want to be judged
i don't want to be judged
