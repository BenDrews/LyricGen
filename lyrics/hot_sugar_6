oh , my , lover lover , lover

have you seen her face ?
oh , my lover lover , lover
see my baby gone mia
have you seen her face ?
i , know , of a remote
cozy abode
on a roll , we get , blow it out of control
as long as you keep it on the low
keep in mind that the sky is the limit
the boundaries are endless
we beginning , the k , the i , the z - zzz
bonafied , baller rides ( baby let's ride )
drop the top , and let the trunk bump
but turn the volume high
don't say a word
look up in the sky
it's a bird , it's a plane , it's a couple of pies
crumble the herb
let's get slurred
break away from all
the stress that's on your mind
i can count to ten
you can go and hide
whenever you want to rest or relax
evacuate , or relocate , just set
don't set trip , no text message
don't get stressed out
don't get set up
get set straight
no twitter
no facebook
crooks on the prowl
on they tippy toes , on they tippy toes
creeping in the cut
we going on a date
escape , disappear , marinate , meditate
and whenever they ask you where you leaving to
tell them outer space
hey baby
slip on something sexy
cook up some spaghetti
then let me know when you're ready
'cause it's simple as 1 - 2 - 3 presto
pull a rabbit out of the ghetto
girl , get in
really though
girl come outside
and play for a while
anything you want
i feel it's been replaced
yeah why
pack your bags but don't get mad
get glad
jump on the passenger side
leave you with nothing but pride
come back with nothing but swag
i ain't got nothing but love
i'm a sweet , but bitter
mr slick ; a wittier player
a winner , a player , a winner , a thug
who under pressure can get it together
come let an og with a felony
give you some pleasure and therapy
give you some clarity
show you the local celebrity
that you can be
po - ten - tially
out of sight , out of mind
out of time , out of state
live right here
for right now
'cause it's so hard to say goodbye to yester , yester
day so when i say so long cinderalla
hope things don't go back to
the way they were , because
that would really suck
parting is such a sweet , a sweet sorrow
but i wish you the best of luck
you can come play whenever
but you can't parley forever
so , whenever you leave
wherever you go
remember
sit back
k - i double zzzzz
hold up i'm buzzing
wanna hang out ?
hide out ?
say something girl
