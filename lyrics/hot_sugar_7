i’m so tired of living with you
tired
i’m so tired of living with you
tired
i’m so tired of living with you
you’re my worst nightmare come true
my eyes droop low because of you
i’m texting on the flip phone
complaining that the wealth is gone
but you blew all your rent on
the nightlife and the ipad
always fussing in the morn'
i’m mad i moved in with a bore
yelling at your ex boys way more than i am
facing the table , cooking eggs up in the morning
i ran out of words to utter , so i end up loaning
every day you’re smoking with the milf next door
who always tries to get me to come fix her drawer
narcolepsy sweeps my every move
when i’m with you i can’t get liver
our ships expire , desire fading
karaoke , singing songs
‘bout how you think you’re treated wrong
why’d you quit your only job
to be a full time pain in my ass ?
i love it when you comb your hair
and the sparkle in your eyes’ glare
only thing that i confess
that i’m holding one that i can’t have
wine glasses shattered on the floor
her fabric’s out at dinner
double date , hooked up with four
this scene’s the last straw , i’ve seen this before
so erica maynard , i just can’t contain her
narcolepsy sweeps my every move
when i’m with you i can’t get liver
our ships expire , desire fading
