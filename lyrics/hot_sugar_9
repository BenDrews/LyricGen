i’m in and out
gravitas from the top to the adidas
try to photocopy the photograph
you don’t know the half
don’t go the path if you don’t know the map
sometimes i sniff powders to fold up my soul in half
and laugh as i sip from a golden flask and lamp
in a stolen pathfinder sipping gras
tryna reach behind the ass and touch the vagina
my bad i’m clowning son take
problems and drown 'em in rum
and ginger ale
kool soul singer too big to fail
oceanic i’m shamu the killer whale
marine world splash splash splash i’m a dolphin
baking pot mixing a cauldron with leonard maltin
nah , it don’t halt , man
fuck with 3 women like robert altman
wrote this on the train ride over here on a iphone
just like i was rick ross or something
oh god dude , i’m totally fuckin' awesome
i do it for the kids who are awesome too
bro , gnarly radical
radical go niners
fuck one - liners i do no - liners
watch the records go gold i’m so midas
shout to run dmc and emmanuel jal
your kid lampin' in some annual ball
all cleaned up or at the mall all leaned up
watch this year i’m all c.r.e.a.m.ed up
but whatever though
i was gonna write a hook but i don’t feel like it
i’m so murphy lee y’all don’t know my government
weed - o puppet wunderkind

i’m eddie murphy in 48 and plenty more
catch me at the penny store
buying art supplies
three stacks off my pictures so far
sometimes the art lies
but the numbers don’t
like they under oath
shout to mama and papa your son’s a g.o.a.t
that’s the acronym
ask the kid a question any question take a crack at him
listen to his answers and laugh at him
like jokes
i got a sixth sense i see white folks
i got a sick sense of humor like why joke
when i kick it with rich bitches i sniff nice coke
i’m in and out , heh
or around maybe , or like i’m in the magic hour
i believe , rapping in a small apartment with hell of electrical equipment in it
i’m in and out
