bring us back , bring us back
bring us back , bring us back
to our very first breath , very first breath
bring us back , bring us back
bring us back , bring us back
to our very first breath , very first breath
nothing’s been the same since we’ve been through
walking in the rain , calling your name in my sleep
never thought you’d run so deep
in the corners of my mind you creep
practicing my aim deep within you
poison in my veins , all cause of the things that you do
at first i thought it couldn’t be true
never thought i would plead you to
hold me , tight in your thoughts
bring us back , bring us back
bring us back , bring us back
to the second we met
you told me , we would get lost
bring us back , bring us back
bring us back , bring us back
to our very first breath
somewhere in the mist i can see you
hanging on a kiss , dreaming of a time gone by
when we wouldn't let each other die
wake up and we would touch the sky
if my only wish ever came true
i'd hang on to your lips
like that shining drop of golden sweat
how could i ever forget to
hold you , tight in my thoughts
bring us back , bring us back
to the second we met
i told you we would get caught
bring us back , bring us back
bring us back , bring us back
to our very first breath
bring us back , bring us back
bring us back , bring us back
to our very first breath , very first breath
bring us back , bring us back
bring us back , bring us back
to our very first breath , bring us back
bring us back , bring us back
no my only wish never came true
walking in the rain , sitting on this train all alone
