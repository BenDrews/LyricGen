you wanted me
you wanted me
you wanted me
you wanted me
and i wanted you
i’m standing by
the side of your house
waiting and waiting
because i know you’re sleeping
sleeping i take
indian steps
because i don’t want
to wake you wake you
look at the sky
now look through my eyes
swim up from the deep
dance in a field of weakness
forever i love you
like a lamb under the gun
i tried to guard your spirit
you became someone
you wanted me
you wanted me
you wanted me
you wanted me
so why would you lead me
through decades to today
only to reach this cliff
would you fall away
where did you come from
only to fade away ?
you reached the shore in your blind luck
but you took death that day
