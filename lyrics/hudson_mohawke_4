oh , let us say a prayer and put our middle fingers in the air
to all the haters like fuck y’all
to all them haters like fuck y’all
they going in for the kill
cause they don’t like the way they feel
they just tryin’ to fill the void to avoid what is real
cause the world is so crowded and everybody is shouting and there’s so many people doubting
we all just want a chance to get it but if you think of it sometimes you’re the one that’s not allowed and
you just wanna hear your voice
but it feels like you can’t do nothing bout it
don’t let them make you quit
don’t let them motherfuckers make you quit now
cause , we might lose a battle but we'll win the war
and we don't care cause love is what we're fighting for
so fuck what they say
cause we are the warriors
we are the warriors
oh , they try to ignore us
you’ll never make it is what they always told us
tried to make us hopeless
take a warm heart heart and turn it to the coldest
like we under hypnosis
we end up doin’ foolish things to get noticed
they act like they don’t need us
but it takes more than a tree to make a forest
cause the world is so crowded and everybody is shouting and there’s so many people doubting
we all just want a chance to get it but if you think of it sometimes you’re the one that’s not allowed and
you just wanna hear your voice
but it feels like you can’t do nothing bout it
don’t let them make you quit
don’t let them motherfuckers make you quit now
cause , we might lose a battle but we'll win the war
and we don't care cause love is what we're fighting for
so fuck what they say
cause we are the warriors
we are the warriors
now let them hear your voice
now let them hear your voice
don’t let them make you quit
don’t let them make you quit , now
cause , we might lose a battle but we'll win the war
and we don't care cause love is what we're fighting for
so fuck what they say
cause we are the warriors
we are the warriors
