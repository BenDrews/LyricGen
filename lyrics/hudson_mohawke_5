we are one
if we run we’re bound to fall in love
the resistance
cause if we run , we’re bound to lose someone
the resistance
it’s killing me in my chest
it's villainy at it's worst
it's memories at it's best
that goes unsaid
i taste your breath
got to hand it to you cause you fall but
you're still standing
the resistance
this love is not a test
it’s tyranny at it’s worst
it’s guidance at it’s best
we both undress , we’re not done yet
and if we run than nothing just sudden death
don’t resist it
we are one
if we run we’re bound to fall in love
the resistance
cause if we run , we’re bound to lose someone
the resistance
it’s killing me in my chest
it's villainy at it's worst
it's memories at it's best
that goes unsaid
i taste your breath
got to hand it to you cause you fall but
you're still standing
the resistance
