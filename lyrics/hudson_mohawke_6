all my anger
spilling over pavement
don't go
please don't let go
tough love
no tennis
i break down , and you stay distant as the blue moon
i break down , and you stay distant as the blue moon
tough love , arsenis
i don't need much , and you stay distant as the blue moon
i don't need much , and you stay distant as the blue moon
so all my anger
spilling over pavement
don't go
please don't let go
i know you're fighting for the both of us
i know you're crying for the both of us
i know you're praying for the both of us
oh
deepspace
a measure of a deep faith
i miss you , but you stay distant as the blue moon
i miss you , but you stay distant as the blue moon
so all my anger
spilling over pavement
don't go
please don't let go
all my anger
spilling over pavement
anguish
don't go
please don't go
all my anger
spilling over pavement
don't go
please don't let go
