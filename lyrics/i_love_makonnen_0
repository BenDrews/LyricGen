squad goin' up , nobody flippin' packs now
i just did 3 in a row , them shows is back - to - back to back now
put the world on our sound , you know party and the weeknd
ain't got no motherfuckin' time to party on the weekend
tell gelo , " bring the juice , we about to get lit "
fill the room up with some tings , one night off and this is it
always workin' ot , overtime and outta town
shit is crazy back home , it kills me that i'm not around
i think we gettin' too deep ; shit i'm talkin' might be too true
upstairs i got xans in an advil bottle , i don't take them shits
but you do , so i got 'em for you
i don't need the pills , i'm just gon' have another drink
and when i'm puttin' work in on a weekend
i'll look back on this and think how we had the club going up
got the club goin' up , on a tuesday

workin' monday night , on the corner flippin' hard
made at least 3 thousand , on the boulevard
i've been workin' graveyard shifts every other weekend
ain't got no fuckin' time to party on the weekend
i've been flippin' in the house , makin' juugs on the highway
i've been ridin' out of state , makin' money like my way
i don't think that i should dance , i'm just gon' have another drink
i'm doin' my stance , you know my molly pink
i got the loudest of the loud , you know my gas stink
my p.o. think i'm in the house , don't give a damn 'bout what she think
got the club goin' up , on a tuesday
got your girl in the cut and she choosey

got your girl in the cut and she choosey
club goin' up , on a tuesday
got your girl in the cut and she choosey
club goin' up , on a tuesday
got your girl in the cut and she choosey
and it ain't no way no , how i made it on my own
i made my own style , i don't think that i should stay
you know i gotta' go , been moving too fast
don't wanna take it slow
got the club goin' up , on a tuesday
got your girl in the cut and she choosey
club goin' up , on a tuesday
got your girl in the cut and she choosey
club goin' up , on a tuesday
got your girl in the cut and she choosey
