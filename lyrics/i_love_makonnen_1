got the club going up on a tuesday
got yo girl in the cut and she choosy
working monday night , on the corner flipping hard
made at least three thousand , on the boulevard
i've been working graveyard , shifts every other weekend
ain't got no fucking time to party on the weekend
i've been flipping in the house , making juugs on the highway
i've been riding out of state , making money like my way
i don't think that i should dance , i'm just gon have another drink
i'm doing my stance , you know my molly pink
i've got the loudest of the loud , you know my gas stink
my p.o. think i'm in the house , don't give a damn about what she think
got the club going up on a tuesday

it ain't no way no how
i made it on my own , i made my own style
i don't think that i should stay , you know i gotta go
you moving too fast , don't want to take it slow
