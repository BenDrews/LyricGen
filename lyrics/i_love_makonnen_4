now we ain't tryna have no fuckin' party
unless your girls tryna all get naughty
i got some lean in my truck right now
and i'm tryna make it all go down
my friends like sniffin' cocaine
they hit the strip club on a bitch and make it rain
i like making money on the fuckin' corner too
but i'd much rather be somewhere doing wall street deals
i had to swerve on em' , i had to swerve
whats the word on them ? what's the word ?
so can i swerve on em' ? can i swerve ?
i had to swerve on em' , i had to swerve
now i'm always flying down on the highways
i be tryna make a money turn to five ways
i remember when i used to have a two way
and now i make the club go up on a tuesday
my cousin outta town with that new shit
he comin' right back like a new pit
he barkin' with that new fuckin' sparker
niggas out here crazy like they waka
i had to swerve on em' , i had to swerve
whats the word on them ? what's the word ?
so can i swerve on em' ? can i swerve ?
i don't like to share my drugs
cause all these niggas wanna smoke my bud
don't nobody have no fuckin' money
they laugh at jokes , ha ha , they think this shit is funny
but ain't nothin' funny at all
i had to make a hundred thousand before fall
i got niggas tryna kick me out my house
i got niggas in the trap like a mouse
i had to swerve on em' , i had to swerve
whats the word on them ? what's the word ?
so can i swerve on em' ? can i swerve ?
i had to swerve on em' , i had to swerve
now i'm bout to fly outta town
i'll be back in september when it's brown
on the leaves but i'll still have that green
i mean my friends kinda know what i mean
we be gettin' fuckin' drunk all the time now
i be tryna be in the high times now
on the front cover with my fuckin' dojer
i play games bitch i'm playstation controller
so let me swerve on em' , so let me swerve
i had to swerve on em' , i had to swerve
whats the word on them ? what's the word ?
so can i swerve on em' ? can i swerve ?
i had to swerve on em' , i had to swerve
