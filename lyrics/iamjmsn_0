{roze - hook} have you ever been chewed up and spit out , on the road to riches but still visit them different routes , ya friends sneak dissing and you just now figured it out. it's the same old shxt , it just comes from a different route. look who's talking , who's ridding around and who's walking , it hurts but it ain't my fault man. i just feel like i got something to prove , and nothing to lose
{iamjustice - verse 1} lil nigga back and relapsing by any means , cut plenty niggas off i felt like been turned enemies , got that choppa and nina for them penalties , bill gates state of mind hustler tendencies. so fuck what you thinking , mind on a fucking billion , go and get it by any means ain't no stopping my ambitions starvation driven sins ain't forgiven , living fully loaded cause i understand this my conviction. criminal minded , addicted to grinding , demons got that steady hand targets always reminded , the plot thickens when you spot the empire divided. young niggas came from nothing them bars were provided. grew up raised by them wolves taught by the jungle , never sublte when we hustled all we knew was struggle , had niggas fall off never been trustful , never fucked with the feds all i knew was trouble , mindstate self made i refuse to fumble

{justice verse 2} back against the wall , still manage to crawl , still manage to keep the damage i got from the fall , niggas count me out , i look for the doubt , critics conversing bout the kid like they gone shut me down. sound the alarm , the savage is loose , grind on gorilla and the bullshit leave no room for truce , never been prone to back down im built for this drama , uncaged in the booth mind on gattis and commas. played my position now the og say decapitate , dominate the opposition then eliminate , dont hesitate just go get the throne and then isolate , start riots in the city watch it escalate. my team been some hunters , the crown for the hunger , surrender your position , you ain't gotta suffer , running with the wolves and they some hungry mofuckas. im in it to win grinding like its 30 of me , winner take all , just hand us the trophies

{justice verse 3} it cost money to go to war with a savage im far from average my language comes from being shackled and challenged so i grabbed the pen and pad and painted pictures all on the canvas. work ethic is hazard these critics baffled i am not a human guess i am species of my own planet , seed of a hustler and rider by way of classical ballads , highly examined , doctors imagined i wouldn't live through the damage so they left me to be food for maggots so its mother - fuck em all gone leave em in them caskets. breaking habits still keeping some bullet fragments , armies making advancements using doubters as target practice , drowing in music and this grind got me lost in the madness , ain't no saving my sanity i dont feel no malice. colored a villian for keeping my eyes on riches , and in my state of mind no competition blurring my vision see my description in this hustle is dont expect my submissions. crown for the taking headshots is the tradition
