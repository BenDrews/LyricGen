{hook - rod anthony} i been out here chasing after commas , everyday this weed got me on my feet ; i been out here chasing after commas , when your broke with nothing to eat it makes it hard to sleep. ( commas , chasing commas , chasing commas. ) when your broke with nothing to eat it makes it hard to sleep. ( commas , chasing commas , chasing commas ) when your broke with nothing to eat it makes it hard to sleep
{verse 1 - iamjustice} i done seen real niggas get pinched for bread , snitch niggas get
filled with lead , real ogs get a fucked up bid just for ridding for a
nigga that never would of emptied his clip. fucked up but as time go by
you already know who gone ride and who already died , in ya mind its
grind till ya last breath , but on the block that paranoia keep you
stressed. long nights , early mornings , niggas trying feed they fam
without mourning , one of they homies family members death , statement
fuck the world till ya last breath. and best believe its still free
all my real niggas locked behind a wall and can't see they seeds , real
hustlers trying do better , keep ya head up you gone make it through
these trials and error

{verse 2 - iamjustice} had my granddad on my mind , he was in my ear telling me to grind , telling me he proud , telling me just smile. telling me , i been through some shit and he proud i done made it to this , telling me don't forget you can't back down , so let off some rounds and gone fly through the clouds . i said yea i noticed , trust im focused , i got the mind of a poet , in the booth reloading , if they dont know by now you can see i ain't folding. in my mind im on beast mode never see those wish ill nigga i still , go for rounds im shooting my enemies down , bullets ricochet im like fuck these clowns
