{hook} tone - i wanna go to a place where dreams will last forever , dreams will last forever more. i wanna to a place , where dreams will last forever , dreams will last forever more
{iamjustice verse 1} - been having nightmares of lost souls , war wounds and gun smoke , fiends on this very block and feds leaving freedom revoked. dark times and lost minds got folks left without hope , soldiers paranoid so popping pills and liquors choked. hard times there's plenty , enemies there's many , peace traded for pennies , fire coming from friendlies , in these times we drop to our knees and pray for rain , cause body bags seem to pop up damn near everyday. the strength from the pain , the open wounds remain , music keeps me sane , never cared for the fame. they look me in the eyes and see the beast , a lion and wolf breed let out the cage for the feast , so to my doubting critics may rest in peace , my back against the wall so i ride with heat , i hope you think before you speak , cause i got nothing to lose and ill let these missiles speak

{iamjustice verse 2} - sometimes i wonder why im built for scars , made to last and pray to god , asking him why he hasnt left or called my number just seems odd , cause i done did so much dirt in my past , i keep asking why im still here and if im gone last. dont get it twisted im not ungrateful i thank the lord everyday , thats why i look at my open wounds and im not ashamed , see i done been to hell and back after been left for dead and i know my grandmother praying for what them scriptures said. im my mothers mircale baby i soldier on , and i salute all my hustlers just know we standing strong , i forgive but never forget the pain , so at night when i lay , just know the bridges you burnt ain't are under the grave. my heads up and im ridding through these storms solo , they say im crazy i laugh and say homes i been loco , just know i been had the game in a chokehold , and what i keep tucked ain't a camera but still flash for photos
