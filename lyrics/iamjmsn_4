{verse 1} - i don't know how many times i can keep going to war with family , how many times you get wounded but but keep ya sanity and my disappointment has grown but its known ill never fold i was born twice as bold with an old soul isn't vanity. and i've seen the fakes remove the mask , my mind state fuck my enemies just load the mac , and pray to god i can keep my head and not relapse , cause in my state of mind its red eye when the tech clap. see i stay around and with ogs , that taught a young g , how to grind and eat low - key , never speak bread or run with weak , when them wolves in the jungle smell the blood on the grass they feast. so its get down or lay down or feel rounds you niggas ain't built for this drama you asking for now , i'm a whole different breed from a different cloth , raised to go war if i feel crossed. long nights , early mornings , snakes in the grass but the choppa got no warning's , moms crying due to stress pops trying be strong lord knows in my past i done paid for my wrongs. only choices i had , was prison death or music so i stuck to the songbird shit now every chance i get with the pen and pad i abuse it

{verse 2} - i was told plenty times i'm a problem child , i was told plenty times that i act wild , they assume somethings wrong cause i barely smile , i tell em i'm just focused on the millions now. i know a few niggas that want me to fail , i also know some niggas that done wished me well , and in the same breath told me to go to hell , i just think its kind of funny when i cant fail. hands to the sky i'm a rider , lords know i'm a survivor , been through the wars and the fires , now i keep a couple choppas for the liars. niggas looking unfamiliar , changing faces that scripture might kill ya , never standing down loyalty is the only pillar all they hear is skrrt when i pull up and show the middle finger. its funny when they state a nigga act different , its crazy when they mad and everybody bitching , same niggas yelling out they gone ride , be same niggas try to take ya life. fuck the ice and the cars , fuck the clothes and these broads , the plan was we was gone ride out together , but you niggas changed face when applied to pressure. boi i never changed up , i just stopped giving a fuck , focused on feeding my family , and for that my middle fingers up. and now niggas think i owe them but im like where the fuck was you when i was broke , niggas wouldn't reach they hands out , now im self made pussy nigga put ya hand down
