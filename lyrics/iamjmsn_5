{hook} i been chasing these dreams so long , the war got my wounds trying tell me hold on , 1 more night 1 mic all you need to take flight you already paying the price so just think of the sights. you done dealt with the fakes and the snakes in the pit , fuck what the critics think you built for this shit , no more tears dry ya eyes kid , this ain't over till we say it is
{verse 1} i been feeling like a fiend since i left the booth , feeling like superman searching for the truth , mind going insane feeling weak like i touched kryptonite like my lifeline been denied , all im trying do is hustle for another life , i ain't seen the worst but ive been through a few fights and tonight ain't no different , critics say they understand but never seen my visions. so now im screaming fuck who dont like how i grind , fuck who don't like how i write or i rhyme , niggx can't tell me shit about the times that i cried or the times i wanted to fucking die. see pain in my face or see it in my eyes , i grind like its 20 of me niggx no lie , told my mother don't worry , ya son is a soldier , been through hell and im still here fuck what they told ya. i been lied to and shitted on name thrown in the mud , cut fam off snake shit get no love , niggxs forget blood just make us relative not family where the loyalty that ya stand with , i never planned this , never thought going through hell would me a young niggx understand rage , understand gain , understand pain , now my middle fingers up like fuck what you say

{verse 2} had plenty homies sitting in the system , plenty niggas living in a cell with fam missing em , plenty niggas talkin bout they wasn't coming home , plenty times i thought if only theyd stayed home. plenty niggas laying in a grave right now , plenty family looking down on me with a smile , half the time as a youngin i thought that was my fate , put my momma through so much bullshit and pain. i know niggas that done lost it all and got it back , plenty times they been released only to relapse , gotta understand the mind is where addictions at , but they dont give a fuck as long as the paper stacks , you better know this war dont come with a draw , soldiers frontline and accepted they flaws , been through hell and back ain't shit different , you ain't built for the war that'll murk you from a distance. heard niggas speak real but ya actions fake , niggas say they finna ride but your life they'll take , its welcome to the jungle shit you either beast or pray , so at night we sleep with choppas and ninas and pray. hope to god we see another day , hope to god for a little rain , you can still feel the wounds when you lay , so at night when i pray i just hear my heart say
