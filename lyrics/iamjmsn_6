she don't know how i be feeling , war wounds with no healing these open windows revealing , demons what im hearing and my visions getting clearer by the day , they say that karma is a bitch but trouble is what don't stay away. and i know i did some dirt in my time but that's why i find hope in these rhymes , the rhyme scheme is never the dream but a cover , to hope that i can hustle for another summer , i know i gotta pay my dues and give my yearly cues , but you ain't my view. so really never hopeless , only thought provoking , musics been my focus , hearing them cell doors seeing prison guards soulless , i choose to take a different route and take up being a poet , no slogans. chasing these dreams i been a fiend , like god had intervened , hustle off the streets , yo passion been in them sheets and i mean , pick up the pen and pad keep grinding , you didn't go thru hell and come back to not start shining
