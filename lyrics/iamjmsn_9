everything begins in sequence
everything begins in time
everything begins with rhythm
everything begins with rhyme. ( all the bodies fall in line. )
we design the future and we design the want
anything anymore controlling has to stop
all just victims of the fashion
meaningless and mindless drones
lost beyond my comprehension
faux rebellion from catalogues
