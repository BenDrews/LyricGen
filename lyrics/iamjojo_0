sometimes behind your pretty smile i see
all your pain , your frustrations and misery
girl , when you feeling turbulence and your ways doesn't get rocky
when you need someone to talk to , you can come to me
it's not your sex even not your beauty , you're my friend
it's not your sex even not your beauty , you're my friend
someday you'll find a husband and child of your own
and someday you'll finally find a place that you can call home
baby when you feeling turbulence and your ways doesn't get rocky
when you need someone to talk to , my god , girl u can talk to me
it's not your sex even not your beauty , you're my friend , yes you are
it's not your sex even not your beauty , you're my friend , yes you are
could it be , break it down , one time
whatever you need , you can count on me , i'll be there , i'll be there
a friend indeed , for whatever you'll do , i'll come running to you
it's not your sex even not your beauty you're my friend , yes you are
it's not your sex even not your beauty you're my friend , yes you are
