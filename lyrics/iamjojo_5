i.am.j.o
( 1st verse )
smoking kush out the zip sipping lean by the liter
shawties on us they be thirsty think they need some aquafina
call up bro we make a hit you gone bump this through your speaker
i be posted on the strip feel like run with my adidas
i smoke dope from night to morning
sipping lean until i'm snoring
niggas all our bitches foreign
yea it's us they be adoring
been this way since i was crawling
feel like spaulding yea i'm balling
hollywood her when she calling
i hang up if she keep talking
im with kymani we cruising the block
i know they mad cuz the music is hot
niggas be bitching and always sneak dissing and they gone switch up when i move to the top
my sprite is dark tell the kids not to sip it
5 - 0 run up and you know that i'm dipping
smoking this dope it's so potent i'm tripping
shawty like calling my phone when she bitching
keep it 100 i'm gone off the gas
they smell it on me its strong when i pass
bitches be on me and all wanna call me when they feeling horny and know i got cash
you against us better stay in your lane
cuz all my killers ain't playing no game
link up with bro shore haven the gang
fuck all the foes ain't saying no name
kymani
( 2nd verse )
she want me now , cause i'm balling
none of these hoes is important
diamonds dripping like a faucet
i'm getting green like a forest
i cannot play with these people
all of yah niggas be see through
i be on point like a needle
don't ever think that i need you
if you thinking you my enemy
nigga you wasting your energy
keanu cooking what's the recipe
stephen he always right next to me
9th grade in the hallway
skipping class like all day
angel miggy & jose
ran right through doorway
tell that girl get out my face ( yeah )
i dont have no time to waste ( yeah )
my style just copy & paste  ( yeah )
y - 3 be all on my waste  ( yeah
white palace tee on me just to show you niggas i got taste  ( yeah )
we ain't running no track , but we going 400 all day
yeah 400 all day
jordan rolling up a backwood
fuck a beef you moving backwards
i cannot fuck with you actors
2nd track this practice ( 2x )
put this beat in a casket
