breath in , breath out
listen , what if we dive into ourselves
concentrate , focus , being here and now
and let our shit out , let it wild out , let it breathe out
it coul be so magic , in fact it is , so galactic
it's so infinite , diving in all this trip
i'm all set up on this weed
imma take another hit
turn it up a lil' bit
till i get all that i need
gotta hold it up , i'ts lit
i got all that i need
burn it up , it’s lit
i got all that i need
hold it up , i'ts lit
keep it up i'ts lit , i got it
keep it up i'ts lit , i got it
baby , blaze it
hazy , tasty , blame me
i can't fake i go crazy
no matter what you the fairy
i won't resist you can drain me
can't barely see it's amazing
all i can see is the main thing
'cause i'm all set up on this weed
imma take another hit
turn it up a lil' bit
till i get all that i need
gotta hold it up , i'ts lit
forgot all that i need
burn it up , it’s lit
forgot all that i need
hold it up , i'ts lit
i'll fuck you until you bleed
keep it up i'ts lit , i got it
keep it up i'ts lit , i got it
