make it bounce
i don't wanna hurt ya but i'm about to work ya
watch your mouth drop real low
i'm turning you up , i'm burning the clutch
full speed , both feet to the floor , feet to the floor
dj running it back once more , time to party that's all i know
grab somebody tell 'em , " baby , baby , baby let's go ! "
bounce , make it , make it bounce ( x3 )
shake it , break it , make it bounce
bounce , make it bounce ( x3 )
shake it , break it , make it bounce
oh - oh - oh - oh ( repeat )
make it bounce
oh - oh - oh - oh ( repeat )
iggy iggy , gettin' 'em tipsy
tippin' em broads , hundreds and fifties
pullin' up , nascar , black car
shittin' on everyone , sippin' whatever we feelin'
real real good , hands to the ceiling
dancin' we dizzy , we spinnin' we spinnin'
all about money , the night's never ending
we party till morning , tomorrow we kick it
let ya hair down and shake that shit , shake that shit , shake that shit
sweat it out , go nuts in this bitch
dip it , spin it , and watchin' my hips
i see you watchin' my hips
crazy , move your body like swayze
round and round , shake it , break it , make it bounce
it's a fucking celebration , go - go - go
girl shake 'em down like you made it , get low - low - low
then show the good like you're wasted , po' - po' - po'
and spray the crowd with amazement , fo' sho - sho - sho
go nuts , hands up , get crazy ( we go ) ( x3 )
go nuts , hands up , get crazy
make it bounce ( x3 )
go nuts , hands up , get crazy
oh - oh - oh - oh ( repeat )
bounce , shake it , break it , make it bounce
oh - oh - oh - oh ( repeat )
bounce , shake it , break it , make it bounce
