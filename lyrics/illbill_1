i left you outside the gates of heaven - they wouldn't let me in
i waved goodbye as you stepped within
it's like hell on earth without you near
i named my daughter after you
so when she smiles it's sorta like you're still here
it's kinda crazy how time flies - 25 years since my grandmom died
but it feels like just yesterday when we was all laughing together
those happy memories are so vivid , they'll last me forever
and yet you're still here somehow - i still feel your presence
i credit you for my inner strength - i feel it in my essense
in my soul , in my inner being , in my genetics
i wouldn't exist if you hadn't persisted through the trenches
i wouldn't have been a lyricist , i owe you every sentence
every verse i've ever written - your energy is kinetic
though i've grown up , i'm still heartbroken , aching to cry
hoping you're the one holding open those gates when i die
i left you outside the gates of heaven - they wouldn't let me in
i waved goodbye as you stepped within
it's like hell on earth without you near
i named my label after you
so when i rhyme it's sorta like you're still here
it's been a year - still in shock about exactly what happened to you
made a song for you called " my uncle "
i was just rapping to you , just talking to you
i just saw you at my mother's house
i can't believe i just bought a coffin for you
we always feared that you would die from an overdose
god knows you loved to do drugs , it swallowed you whole
but in the end , drugs didn't kill you , cancer did
why do good people die young ? i don't know what the answer is
all i know is i worshipped you as a scrappy kid
being around you made me feel cooler than rapping did
& that's pretty fuckin cool , trust me
i was embarrassed when you started smoking crack
honestly , it crushed me - swept it under the rug
started smoking weed & popping acid but managed to not do the uglier drugs
we grew apart after my grandmother died
homeless , in and outta jail , we stopped relating to each others lives
but years later , we connected once again
not just as nephew and uncle , but as homies , we were friends
though i've grown up , i'm still heartbroken , aching to cry
hoping you're the one holding open those gates when i die
