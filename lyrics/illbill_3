hip hop brought cultures together
i remember cugines in camaros pumping " tougher than leather "
yankel rosenbaum still got stabbed in crown heights
gavin cato got hit when they ran that red light
over a decade of healing but the scars remain
both families involved still harbor the pain
age 13 - 70's baby raised in the 80's
mad fights with blacks and whites
and both sides hated me for nonsense
the white kids was playin it wack
cos i'm from the projects and my neighbors is black
i had to prove whiteboys could thump too
but fuck skin color - i was proud to call myself a tough jew
i guess i'm mad lucky to be raised in ny
the world's capitol - my attitude was take em to war
other places would've raised me in a useless format
in texas they dream about hunting jews with borat
call me white nigga
call me christ killer or kike
call me nigga lover
because i spit on the mic
think you got me figured out
you're not listening right
get ya fuckin head kicked in for thinkin you're hype
call me white nigga
call me christ killer or kike
call me nigga lover
because i spit on the mic
think you got me figured out
you're not listening right
get ya fuckin head kicked in for thinkin you're hype
they call me white nigga
call me every name in the book
i done heard em all
fuck ya'll - i made it a hook
made it a song
exposing the hatred to all
cos any type of racism is wrong
had newsmen talking as a kid about yusef hawkins
same age as me when joey fama caught him walking through bensonhurst
a world away from my glenwood projects
racially mixed - combustible - it lead to conflicts
i was never raised prejudice
my grandmother was a holocaust survivor
and my uncle did heroin
my pops wasn't around
my moms kicked him out the house
and broke her back to put food in our mouths
age 12 - they bussed my projects to the white school
holes in my sneakers - i never fit in with them rich white dudes
i didn't click up with the blacks kids neither - i bought a iron maiden
t - shirt and wrote rhymes in my trapper keeper
call me white nigga
call me christ killer or kike
call me nigga lover
because i spit on the mic
think you got me figured out
you're not listening right
get ya fuckin head kicked in for thinkin you're hype
call me white nigga
call me christ killer or kike
call me nigga lover
because i spit on the mic
think you got me figured out
you're not listening right
get ya fuckin head kicked in for thinkin you're hype
run - d.m.c. really made me wanna get wreck
same time kerry king played guitar for megadeth
it was 84 , 85 - ll cool j " rock the bells "
obliterated my mind - so inspired i created a rhyme
beastie boys on u68 - " she's on it " made up my mind
hardcore - the other bright side
i thought bad brains was white guys when melle mel dropped " white lines "
nazi skinheads showed up at lamour's in brooklyn
got stabbed up by puerto rican skins from bushwick
geraldo got his nose broken - tawana brawley on donahue
central park wildin had the world scopin
now vh1 got a show for wiggers
and some claim the jews be the biggest wiggers - we're considered
the most dangerous cause they think we shift our forms
cast spells & wear beanies to restrict our horns from being seen
growing out our heads - the killers of christ
these fools wear white sheets and believe that hitler was right
believe it or not they still exist undercover
and mel gibson never liked danny glover
another piece of shit called out in the paper - if we was there
me and my peoples would have beat the fuckin shit outta kramer
if this song offends you , you're a hater - take a look within yourself
and figure out what the fuck you're afraid of
call me white nigga
call me christ killer or kike
call me nigga lover
because i spit on the mic
think you got me figured out
you're not listening right
get ya fuckin head kicked in for thinkin you're hype
call me white nigga
call me christ killer or kike
call me nigga lover
because i spit on the mic
think you got me figured out
you're not listening right
get ya fuckin head kicked in for thinkin you're hype
