my life is - i'm dependent , i can't help it. i started at a young age
i'm too dependent on it , you know ?
drugs and music get me where i wanna go now
but i gotta make the money for it and it's not that easy nowadays
my uncle shoots heroin , my father used to do cocaine
my moms used to smoke weed with her friends when i was eight
smoked weed when i was twelve , sold weed at fourteen
bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity
conscious rap is bullshit , gangster rap is a fraud
this is real rap , bang your fucking head through the wall
this is drug music , stuck with a syringe in your arm
i'm the truth like the name of the song
yo my uncle shoots heroin
bathroom floor , found a syringe
when i was on the hydro tour howie went out on a binge
the snake bitch i was fucking even took him to cop
a month later he was on the floor looking for rock
missed a flight to czech republic , walked in the path
of howie lying in his own puke dying from crack
cocaine poisoning , he shot the heroin since fourteen
february 2003 , he was clean
i helped him out , he kicked crack , dope , and meth
hosted shows , free clothes , bubblebaths , autographs
t - shirts , soon i'mma make a howie action figure
before his latest relapse i'm glad i captured pictures
i love howie , homie used to change my diapers
to save him i'd have jumped in front of spray from snipers
but this is just something that he's gotta do on his own
i try to get through to him with this song yo
my uncle shoots heroin , my father used to do cocaine
my moms used to smoke weed with her friends when i was eight
smoked weed when i was twelve , sold weed at fourteen
bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity
conscious rap is bullshit , gangster rap is a fraud
this is real rap , bang your fucking head through the wall
this is drug music , stuck with a syringe in your arm
i'm the truth like the name of the song
yo my uncle shoots heroin
he used to live in my crib , sleep on my couch smoking newport 100's
gave me comic books , bought me my first bass guitar
learned from my grandma how to tell you the future with cards
watch the sci - fi channel high off of methadone
more addictive than anything injected in the arm
d.t.'s five in the morning waking my moms
got a search warrant but howie tenenbaum is gone
roaming the streets , he was a superhero to me
when i was five i used to pick the seeds out of his weed
nodding out , burning cigarette holes in his sheets
wake up and eat a box of captain crunch then go back to sleep
he was a crackhead too , he might still be
a walking relapse , that motherfucker's still on the street
you tell him right he goes left
show him right he does wrong
i hope i get through to him with this song yo
my uncle shoots heroin , my father used to do cocaine
my moms used to smoke weed with her friends when i was eight
smoked weed when i was twelve , sold weed at fourteen
bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity
conscious rap is bullshit , gangster rap is a fraud
this is real rap , bang your fucking head through the wall
this is drug music , stuck with a syringe in your arm
i'm the truth like the name of the song
yo my uncle shoots ( my uncle shoots )
