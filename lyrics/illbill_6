the anatomy of a school shooting , shotgun under my trenchcoat
columbiners did it , dead spoke - bloodred soaked
my mind consume the doom as i walk through the school
15 people killed and over 14 wounded
my name is eric harris , i was forever harrased , an outcast
you fuck with us and now me and dylan is pulling out gats
i've been wantin to murder people
suicide is played out , if you gonna die , take people with you
we've been planning this before the kids from jonesboro did it
and i wanted the world to know when people died why we did it
i even killed myself but don't feel sorry for me
feel sorry for your seads as we spread the diesease
another bloodbath coming soon to a school near you
smalltown killing - spree that's organized by the youth
fuck the media , them fags be disguising the truth
dragging my name through the mud when televizing the news
a bunch of ticking timebombs y'all , is more like me
overflowin with hate , bullied to get raw like me
they constantly get picked on and shitted on like me
you'd probably get your head blown off by a kid like me
i put my mind to it and what i accomplish's frightening
the right thing , no matter what you idiots might think
check it , i did that shit so idiots might think
this ain't a game , the nerds that you be fuckin with might flip
it's like this , what's more fun than slice wrist ?
kill that teacher that you hate , spray 25 kids
you'd be famous just like me if you did what i did
this is the anatomy of a school shooting
i see dead people , it isn't my fault that they were evil
fuck a favorite i hate everybody equal
bitch i warned y'all , didn't i ?
now everybody wanna talk shit and cry asking why
- two geeks picked up guns and turned murderous
all of y'all under beneath me you don't deserve to live
two nerdy kids is that a crime ?
why i've gotta be one of the cool kids just to walk by
- without being tripped , thrown down on the ground and kicked
insulting me for no reason , i was treated like shit
the teachers let it happen
i've even seen some of them teachers laughing
that's why i had a smile on my face when i started blastin
i wasn't crazy - all of y'all were sick
i was the nicest person in the world - y'all were dicks
don't even try to analyze me now you have no chance , back then
- maybe you could've been my friend
