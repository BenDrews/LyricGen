i once knew a nigga whose real name was william
his primary concern was makin' a million
bein' the illest hustler that the world ever seen
he used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams
a corrupted young mind at the age of thirteen
nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
she put the pipe down , but for every year she was sober
her son's heart simultaneously grew colder
he started hangin' out , sellin' bags in the projects
checkin' the young chicks , lookin' for hit - and - run prospects
he was fascinated by material objects
but he understood money never bought respect
he built a reputation , 'cause he could hustle and steal
but got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal
so criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
you see , me and niggas like this have never been equal
i don't project my insecurities in other people
he fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
so he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
a feeble - minded young man with infinite potential
the product of a ghetto - bred capitalistic mental
coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
dancin' with the devil , smoked until his eyes would bleed
but he was sick of sellin' trees , and gave in to his greed
everyone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences
you probably only did a month for minor offenses
ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance
but then again , there's always the wicked that knew in advance
dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
but that's what happens when you rape , murder , and sell rock
devils used to be god's angels that fell from the top
there's no diversity , because we're burnin' in the melting pot
so billy started robbin' niggas , anything he could do
to get his respect back in the eyes of his crew
startin' fights over little shit up on the block
stepped up to sellin' mothers and brothers the crack rock
workin' overtime for makin' money for the crack spot
hit the jackpot , and wanted to move up to cocaine
fulfillin' the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
tired of the block niggas treatin' him the same
he wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
but when he tried to step to 'em , niggas showed him no love
they told him any motherfuckin' coward can sell drugs
any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs
any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood
even puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club
but only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die
standin' in front of them , starin' straight into their eyes
billy realized that these men were well - guarded
and they wanted to test him before business started
suggested rapin' a bitch to prove he was cold - hearted
so now he had a choice between goin' back to his life
or makin' money with made men up in the cyph'
his dreams about cars and ice made him agree
a hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
and so he met them friday night at a quarter to three
everyone tryin' to be trife never face the consequences
you probably only did a month for minor offenses
ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance
but then again , there's always the wicked that knew in advance
dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
but that's what happens when you rape , murder , and sell rock
devils used to be god's angels that fell from the top
there's no diversity , because we're burnin' in the melting pot
they drove around the projects slow while it was rainin'
smokin' blunts , drinkin' and jokin' for entertainment
until they saw a woman on the street , walkin' alone
three in the mornin' , comin' back from work , on her way home
and so they quietly got out the car and followed her
walkin' through the projects , the darkness swallowed her
they wrapped her shirt around her head
and knocked her onto the floor
" this is it , kid , now you got your chance to be raw. "
so billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
and dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
she struggled hard , but they forced her to go up the stairs
they got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
screamin' , " shut the fuck up , and stop movin' around ! "
the shirt covered her face , but she screamed and clawed
so billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw
the dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin'
they kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin'
blood leakin' through the cloth , she cried silently
and then they all proceeded to rape her violently
billy was made to go first , but each of them took a turn
rippin' her up and chokin' her until her throat burned
her broken jaw mumbled for god , but they weren't concerned
when they were done and she was lyin'
bloody , broken and bruised
one of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty - two
they told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
and if he killed her , he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
he thought about it for a minute , she was practically dead
and so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head
i'm fallin' and i can't turn back
i'm fallin' and i can't turn back
right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life
he thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
and he felt strong standin' along with his new brothers
cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover
but what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
'cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother
she looked back at him and cried 'cause he had forsaken her
she cried more painfully than when they were rapin' her
his whole world stopped , he couldn't even contemplate
his corruption had successfully changed his fate
and he remembered how his mom used to come home late
workin' hard for nothin' , because now what was he worth ?
he turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
and cryin' out to the sky , 'cause he was lonely and scared
but only the devil responded , 'cause god wasn't there
and right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
and so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
they say death takes you to a better place , but i doubt it
after that , they killed his mother , and never spoke about it
and listen , 'cause the story that i'm tellin' is true
'cause i was there with billy jacobs , and i raped his mom too
and now the devil follows me everywhere that i go
in fact , i'm sure he's standin' among one of you at my shows
and every street cypher , listenin' to little thugs flow
he could be standin' right next to you , and you wouldn't know
the devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
white , brown , yellow and black — color is not restricted
you have a self - destructive destiny when you're inflicted
and you'll be one of god's children that fell from the top
there's no diversity , because we're burnin' in the melting pot
so when the devil wants to dance with you , you better say never
because a dance with the devil might last you forever
{hidden track : " diabolical " }
oh , y'all motherfuckers thought it was over , huh ?
well , it’s not , you didn’t count on a fallen angel gettin' back
into the grace of god and comin' after you
y’all niggas ain’t shit , your producers ain’t shit
your fuckin' a & r ain’t shit
i’ll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal
yo , diabolic , take this motherfucker’s head off !
go ‘head and grip glocks
i’ll snap your trigger finger in six spots
you’ll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots
i’ll watch you topple flat
put away your rings and holla back
can’t freestyle ; you’re screwed off the top , like bottle caps
beneath the surface
i’m overheatin’ your receiving circuits
by unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches
what you preach is worthless
your worship defeat the purpose
like president bush takin' bullets for the secret service
beyond what y'all fathom , i shit on cats and jaw tap ‘em
show no compassion , like havin’ a straight - faced orgasm
tour jack ‘em , have his half - a - ten bitch suck my friend’s dick
in the mean time , you can french kiss this clenched fist
diabolic : a one - man brigade spreadin' cancer plague
fist - fuckin’ a pussy’s face , holdin' a hand grenade
so if i catch you bluffin' , faggot , you’re less than nothin'
i just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction
you motherfuckers are nothin' , you cannot harm me
i’ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army
storm the planet , huntin' you down , ‘cause i’m on a mission
to split your body into a billion one - celled organisms
immortal technique’ll destroy your religion , you stupid bitch
you’re faker than blue - eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix
i’m 'bout to blow up , like nasa challenger computer chips
arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily
i’m like time itself : i’m gonna kill you inevitably
chemically bomb you , fuck usin’ a chrome piece
i’m illmatic , you won’t make it home , like jerome’s niece
i’ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me
and then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy
this puppet democracy brain - washed your psychology
so you’re nothin' , like diversity without equality
and your crew is full of more faggots than greek mythology
usin' numerology to count the people i sent to heaven
produces more digits than 22 divided by 7
you’re like kevin spacey : your style is usually suspect
you never killed a cop , you not a motherfuckin' thug yet
your mind is empty and spacious
like the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist
face it , you’re too basic , you’re never gonna make it
like children walkin' through antarctica , butt - naked
