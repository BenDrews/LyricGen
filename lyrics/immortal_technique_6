they told me i would never make it , i would never achieve it
reality is nourishment , but people don't believe it
i guess it's hard to stomach the truth like a bulimic
it's a dirty game and nobody is willin' to clean it
but this is for the paraplegic people dreamin' of runnin'
ladies married to men who don't please 'em , dreamin' of comin'
verbally murderous like david berkowitz when i'm gunnin'
some cowards on the internet didn't think i would sell
scared to talk shit in person 'cause they stuck in a shell
and couldn't understand the pain of bein' stuck in a cell
hell is not a place you go if you're not a christian
it's the failure of your life's greatest ambition
it's a bad decision to blindly follow any religion
i don't see the difference in between the wrong and the wrong
soldiers emptyin' the clips at little kids and they moms
are just like a desperate motherfucker strapped to a bomb
humanity's gone , smoked up in a gravity bong
by a democrat - republican cheech and chong
immortal technique , you never heard me preach in a song
i'm not controversial , i'm just speakin' the facts
put your hands in the air like you got the heat to your back
and shake your body like a baby born addicted to crack
and since life's a gamble like the craps tables at vegas
i freestyle my destiny , it's not written in pages
i hate it when they tell us how far we came to be
as if our people's history started with slavery
painfully i discovered the shit they kept us secret
this is the exodus , like the black jews out of egypt
i keep it reality based with the music i make
blow up the truth in your face with the style i run with
like the navy missile that shot down flight 800
i'm like the africans who came here before colombus
and from the 1500's until after the morrow
i watched latin america get raped in the sorrow
you see , the spaniards never left despues de colon
and if you don't believe me , you can click on univision
i never seen so much racism in all of my life
every program and newscaster , all of them white
it's like apartheid with 10 percent rulin' the rest
that type of stress will make me put the fuckin' tool to your chest
step in my way , nigga , i wouldn't wanna be ya
i burn slow like pissin' drunk with gonorrhea
i'll do a free show in north korea , burnin' the flag
while j. edgar hoover politicians dress up in drag
try to confuse you , makin' it hard to follow this :
capitalism and democracy are not synonymous
you swallow propaganda like a birth control pill
sellin' your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill
but that will never be me 'cause i'm leavin' the past
like an abused wife with the kids , leavin' your ass
like a drug addict clean and sober , leavin' the stash
unbreakable technique , leavin' the plane crash
i'm out with the black box and i refuse to return
i spit reality instead of what you usually learn
and i refuse to be concerned with condescendin' advice
'cause i'm the only motherfucker that could change my life
some people think i won't make it , but i know that i will
escape the emptiness 'cause that shit is slow and it kills
the flow and the skill , i made y'all believe that it last
you can make the future , but it starts with leavin' the past
