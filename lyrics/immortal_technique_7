man , you hear this bullshit they be talking
every day , man
it's like these motherfuckers is just like professional liars
you know what i'm sayin' ? it's wild , listen
bin laden didn't blow up the projects
it was you , nigga
tell the truth , nigga !
bush knocked down the towers
tell the truth , nigga !
bush knocked down the towers
tell the truth , nigga !
i pledge no allegiance , nigga , fuck the president's speeches !
i'm baptized by america and covered in leeches
the dirty water that bleaches your soul and your facial features
drownin' you in propaganda that they spit through the speakers
and if you speak about the evil that the government does
the patriot act will track you to the type of your blood
they try to frame you and say you was tryna sell drugs
and throw a federal indictment on niggas to show you love
this shit is run by fake christians , fake politicians
look at they mansions , and look at the conditions you live in
all they talk about is terrorism on television
they tell you to listen , but they don't really tell you they mission
they funded al - qaeda , and now they blame the muslim religion
even though bin laden was a cia tactician
they gave him billions of dollars and they funded his purpose
fahrenheit 9/11 ? that's just scratchin' the surface !
bin laden didn't blow up the projects
it was you , nigga
tell the truth , nigga !
bush knocked down the towers
tell the truth , nigga !
bush knocked down the towers
tell the truth , nigga !
they say the rebels in iraq still fight for saddam
but that's bullshit , i'll show you why it's totally wrong
‘cause if another country invaded the hood tonight
it'd be warfare through harlem and washington heights
i wouldn't be fightin' for bush or white america's dream
i'd be fightin' for my people's survival and self - esteem
i wouldn't fight for racist churches from the south , my nigga
i'd be fightin' to keep the occupation out , my nigga
you ever clock someone who talk shit or look at you wrong ?
imagine if they shot at you and was rapin' your moms
and of course saddam hussein had chemical weapons
we sold him that shit after ronald reagan's election
mercenary contractors fightin' a new era
corporate military bankin' off the war on terror
they controllin' the ghetto with the fear of attack
tryin' to distract the fact that they engineerin' the crack
so i'm strapped , like lee malvo , holdin' a sniper rifle
these bullets will touch your kids , and i don't mean like michael
your body be sent to the morgue , stripped down and recycled
i fire on house niggas that support you and like you
‘cause innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily
and poor people never get shit and struggle daily
this ain't no alien conspiracy theory , this shit is real
written on the dollar underneath the masonic seal
i don't rap for dead presidents
i'd rather see the president dead
it's never been said , but i set precedents
bin laden didn't blow up the projects
it was you , nigga
tell the truth , nigga !
bush knocked down the towers
tell the truth , nigga !
bush knocked down the towers
tell the truth , nigga !
shady records was eighty seconds away from the towers
some cowards fucked with the wrong building
they meant to hit ours
