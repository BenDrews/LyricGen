the power of god's in you , show n prove
( yeah , this is the power )
the power of god's in you , show n prove
( true power , showin' and provin' )
the power of god's in you , show n prove
true , the time has come through
chose the few , must show and prove
i once asked god to forgive for my sins
bent on my knees pleadin' to be heavenly cleansed
said the holy ghost changed the ways and actions of men
when i stood , i felt the same as if i just walked in
i was twelve at the time , held nines , held mines
a frail mind , criminal thoughts well - designed
then the older gods put me on , on how to rock this
maintain , 360 , lord and live prosperous
his jewel was priceless , keep the cypher righteous
bare in mind , god , some of your own won't like this
i'm mentally scarred , recuperatin' from abrasure
fooled by interpretations made from a traitor
it's in my nature , i was taught , that's the first law
obtain the food , clothin' and the shelter that i search for
the fire in my eyes is hot as earth's core
what hurts more , the fact that we still dirt poor
in hard times force crimes out of honest man
and most fiend to see the so - called promised land
sun of man , knowledge , wisdom and understand
that it's time to take matters in our own hands
the power of god's in you , show n prove
the power of god's in you , show n prove
the power of god's in you , show n prove
true , the time has come through
chose the few , must show and prove
the wicked ways of the world can't escape sin
i'm facin' master's gun on the plantation
seen source from home yet i'm still caged in
'cuz 9000 miles is such a long way to swim
and many die tryin' to survive the next mile
families was raised as slaves and exiled
i learned it as a child , knowledge be the key
to unlock your brain and set your mindstate free
it's true , the times come through , chose the few
show n prove , the power of god's in you
or remain a savage in pursuit of happiness
who lacks jewels , love and peace - complete the package
the fact is , five out a hundred know the truth
the wisdom might blow the roof when shown and proved
through the course of time , we was dumb , deaf and blind
now , we on the incline , build with one mind
came a long way but , yo , we still far behind
so , uplift the mind , god , rise and shine
i speak to the black , brown and yellow seeds
my fellow breed all races , colors and creeds
search for the knowledge , use science and math
and be queens and kings like the centuries past
the devil tried to fool my people , said we was equal
but i believe him when my culture sees freedom
you beat 'em with the positive thoughts , you don't need 'em
leave him in the dirt , let the blood suckers see him
