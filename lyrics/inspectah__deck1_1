{*evil laughter*}
yeah , ins , yo
la the darkman
hit 'em with the death blow
yo
yo , i'm known to spit poems , throw dice and hold tones
show ice , puff bones , hit beats like larry holmes
through the valley of kings , you catch the killa bee sting
tryin to pick up , you fuckin with the archbishop
defyin me is like startin rap world war 3
you rather sell your key to nypd
my style's vicious , i rap in the lab and break dishes
my words wear jet black hoods , lookin suspicious
darkman
behold the struggle fire ultra harmonizer , track paralyzer
artist he the real , blood spilled on the synthesizer
4th , turn it up a peak , make the speaker tweet
iron sheik camel clutch a beat , rappers take your seat
in fact punch a clock , it's my time to rock , dock the known like a scott
engineered this thought that i present , so just
comprehend , while i fill you in , with a bar or ten
and clear the path for the god sin , do 'em in kid ( yo )
i stay lurkin , circlin the premises
dart chemist sent on a search for arch nemesis
concoctin neurotoxins out of synonyms
send your physical in triple shock , crippled in a detox with no rememberance
while i rocks the maximum shows for no minimum
capacity to pack the front row but flow naturally
killin 'em , swing on the stage like jagged pendulums
and blow like thirty shrapnel grenades with no pins in 'em
why risk it ? killah hill district , we flip shit
egotistic , i hold grounds with twin biscuits
put it up , i lay it down , my streets sound surround
shaolin bound , flash flood watch you might drown
headliner , move through the city like a sidewinder
island drifter , black vagina finder
loungin by the seashore , switch like bloody roar
and slap hardcore dick to your main wiz , bitch
toxi' on bacardi pina , low crawlin through medina
slumped in the seven - seater
dumpin heaters , to bite might cause seizures
weak mc's take me to your leader
we the true source , movin off on uncharted course
my thoughts come across with a blindin force
killa bees plant seeds , log on
or get knocked off like a pawn if you dare lock horns
you are now in the 9th chamber
where the falls of reality close in fast on the world of make - believe
and your fantasy is nothin more but a memory
now bear witness to the realness
shown and proven
we live by the sword...
