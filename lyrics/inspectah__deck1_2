you can't hack the tactics
of a semi - automatic full rap fanatic
you can't hack the tactics
of a semi - automatic full rap fanatic
i make mean lean when i pump my spunk
and hands of chump , of machine gun funk
i bliss , like the fist , of the mantis
those who oppose get dropped and hit the canvas
with rigormor' , i hit you in the core and
pop your legs well in the figure four
you can't stop the force when the blood is coursin
extortion , i'm comin like the headless horseman
enforcin , tortureous slang from a fortune
swordsman , throw your rap corpse in coffins
don't pop glocks at me then cop a plea
a hundred thousand leagues beneath the sea
deep depths makes rappers salted
weak rappers asses i cracks my foot , off in
lay down them lines with them hard hits
and i'm harmin , bombin , with heavy bombardments
pushin , poetry , like weed by the pounds
underground railroad rza track lay it down
i'm hard as pavement , you gaze from amazement
knock you in the head you wonder where the days went
it's golden bangles , microphone getting strangled
five - star general , scars you want to angle
bizarre thriller , war scar for a killer
sheisty mic device got my hand - piece throbbin
slice mics precise on down to ice carvings
chorus 2x
yo
i set the mic in flames , bomb like fighter planes
mc's are shot down long range with sniper aim
no question marks , the session starts with sparks
my flows explodes like hand grenades through your parts
universal soldier , mo's the holder
globe in both hands , born to be sole controller
hit the world full blast , my crime pays cash
slip past c - cyphers and the flash from the photograph
best - seller compose a rough draft
razor sharp vocabulary cut glass
actual facts crowds of thousands collapse
you can't catch my style with bugs and phone taps
whether rhymes or crimes , i want mines regardless
hard targets , underground like black markets
pirates of the darkest water feel the aura
importer of rough raps that's snuck cross the border
semi - automatic attack'll spray y'all
liquid sword swingin slay all , i'm awol
chorus 1.5x
wu - tang be , killin you softly with this song
you won't survive the outcome i bring def jams to your eardrums
p.l.o. hits the hardest , regardless
felony offenders catchin murder one charges
open cases , got me smoked out in staircases
the dark crusader jackin cats in elevators
i strike back like the jedi , from n.y
it's i illifyin , dope rhyme supplyin
i be all you need to rock these mic devices
projectile shaolin style exiles your juvenile freestyle
i'm not your basic street entrepeneuer , crime tour , packs the luger
high pursuit for the cream like the bodyguard from bejing
inject you with the morphine , then i flee the murder scene
on your facilities , the penalty , doa
bomb shell your burrow like bombay
opposites attack that's why these thieves stay strapped
as we , travel the globe to put shaolin on the map
i show loyalty , to my fans fully
operational raps , that bust through your skully
i'm rated second - to - none i be the top gun
from the land of the slums spittin blades from my tongue
park hill slug slinger , hit you with the sleeper
hit - seeker , sounds that be attackin your speaker
watch me bang the headpiece kid there's no survival
my flow lights up the block like a homicidal
murder , underground beef for the burger
p.l.o. , criminal thoughts you never heard of
