*eerie winds blow*
*winds die down as beat drops*
it had to be this way
this is for real
nobody said it would be easy
so let it be ( ooh.. oh yeah )
aiyyo , s.i.n.y. , killa bee hive
eastside , duckin' the 5 , roll wit' the live
sweet love , sweep me in the bug eye , we 'bout to glide
head fried , spittin' the scribe , move in disguise
wan' test i ? access denied
i live and die by the motto : let none survive
livin' off my last cut , can't hold the sword up
you can have that for free before i take your best offer
stalker , preparin' for your sianora
torture , test my waters i come like orca
niggas need life supporters , for bein' so weak
i speak as a veteran and lace the heads i've creased
and live my footprints wherever i've blessed my presence
i.n.s. , livin' legend 'til the essence
givin' with no prescription , this is the medicine
settin' a new standard , they fail measurin' up to
they suck too , thorns in the hustle
pawns in the struggle , darts fly like c.i.s beyond the jungle
trouble man can't dance the hollywood shuffle
knees buckle when the killa bees come thru
all you heard was " 1 , 2 " , then the gun blew
question is , " from who ? " , numb you
like a 100 cc's of morphine and daily
keep out of reach of your offsprings
too hot to handle , too cold to hold
you pumpin' that substance , that's uncontrolled
*repeat 2x*
too cold to hold , substance - - uncontrolled
five - o said , " tell it to the judge " , i never told
never fold , know some turn like fake gold
young and old i look down like parole holds
in the midst where the clips blow , i rip shows
hit your zip code , my sick flow condones
soon to spread like ebola , the autopsy showed
the reports , another jon doe - - overdoser
overexposure , facin' the flame thrower
i hold you hostage , the code name's the iyatollah
mind controller , 2009 time quota
the high roller , sting like a king cobra
blow the whistle on kids who unofficial
pistol pops , ceremony deep within the gristle
nickel and dime , rhymes sign of the times
my life line , bubble like a fine wine , dyin' for mines
the dopeman , deliver like the postman
patrol man , saw the hand - to - hand , did i run ?
they know i got the teens strung , plus the fiends come
in abundance , lined up , spendin' 100's
the substance provides , continuous high
i'll give you one free for every 5 sides you buy
gettin' high off my own supply , low in the ride
with the low eye , daybreak and makin' dough rise
my style's so underground , i write rhymes on fossils
use as directed and wear protective goggles
shaolin's the borough , rap picasso
blow like a hollow - point , foes sure to follow
pop a bottle forever , can't stop tommorow
chewin' all food for thought , hard to swallow
cold like chicago winds , taps on my convo
el diablo cross the verazanno
p.l.o. style , released while the beasts raid
and those who can't stand the heat , they seek shade
the rapture was told of how one man tackled the globe
we go so deep , it rattles your soul
i see many have come , but few are chose for the role
in this ritual , rhymes walkin' on hot coals
quick to spot those who pose as friends and foes
wind up violated like i was the p - o
satisfaction or your money back
gotta keep to makin' comebacks
it's the best that you ever had
got you fiendin' on the next bag
uncontrolled...
