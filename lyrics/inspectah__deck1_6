elevation ( x15 )
tired of trials and tribulations
it seems like life is hell , dreams the only way of escapin
to worlds that's beyond imagination
i know a place , i could take you there through elevation
where i come from young ones pump jums for lump sums
bustin guns , trust none , become son
truth spells broke loose shells that propel
where i'm dwellin , niggas bail , tellin what you sellin
my nigga tone just came home but improvised
the system tried to give him 5 more for gettin high
fly stacy , daddy's little lady fucks crazily
baby after baby , lost her shape as of lately
used to spend the quiet nights home , now she likes to roam
feelin quite grown , caught in like cyclones
i was taught be the wise of glide and i'll impass
to advance , learn the science of life and earn the masters
trapped in the havoc , i'm forced to go the whole
although , it might spell a jail cell and no parole
i fight with the force of steve austin
until my arms can no longer hold off the coffin
in this ghetto heaven , god bless the children
whose shattered dreams are offered and hard to mend
we don't believe in heaven , we livin in hell
tryin to escaped , but fate's sealed in the bomb shell
feelin like u'ey , he knew they would pnat the plot
when high - tech surveillance got my moves on watch
so , i drop jewels , use the music to educate
can't celebrate 'til we elevate
