he's been taking it easy , and then suddenly the moment came
suddenly , the moment came , watch it , and...
he has put together a flurry and put the champion away
but no one has ever been able to do that
and he's trynna survive to the final bell , what a fight
you never will conquer the champion
you never will conquer the champion
i stream machine gun funk , trump slayer
major payne game hunter , summer time shine
mind controller , hold the crowd still hill top dweller
sell the garden out , house gang chain
cuban link blink , lose shoes , you can never wear
stare hard , god rise above , love hate , make your choice
voice like luther , future hall of famer
came a long way , stay fly , i , soldier , ayatollah
airbender send a chill , drill sarge , hard bottom
got 'em hooked , took my time , grind heavy
ready for the world , girl please , he's too experienced
been a don , avalon size , wise to it
do it like , nike type gritty , city boy , 'noid never
better recognize , eyes of the tiger
the fire breather , he the truth , son
the champion
you never will conquer the champion
you never will conquer the champion
this is ruger rap , clap clips , strips buzzing
cousin got the spot a blaze , j's crisp , this time styling
island of stat , black hawk , walk with me , fifty cal flow
blow the roof , you learn , burn unit
true it's popping , watch 'em work , purp' smoking , toke and rapping
catch a tidal wave , slave to the rhythm , give 'em hell
bell ringer , springer show , throw a chair , air it out
doubting deck , check your pulse , folks , witness history
rewriting the script , switch it on 'em , taught 'em how
now's a new day , say what ? clutch shooter
through the storm , calm bomb , armed dangerous , spit game
flame thrower , cobra commander , pandemonium , it's only him
swim with the sharks , spark like night breeze
see plan the camera flash , cash only homey
and not jammed til the band done , the champion
you never will conquer the champion
you never will conquer the champion
