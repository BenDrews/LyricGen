yo , the bare facts make 'em take flight like air max
hyperdermix raps , share it and you'll both have tracks
dope man supply fire to wax , push your wigs back
hit ya like a tall cat , make ya relapse
never before have ya ever heard this level of raw
my metaphors touch down like the hammer of thor
knee deep into the war , sirens and gats roar
livin life , ragin bull , life's the matador
i soar , above the law , branded illegal
they still rush my door cuz i'm power to the people
sharp as an eagle's claw , certified lethal
keanu reaves can't match the speed i exceed to
crash the party , make 'em jump like kenevil
i take cash in advance and blast off on retrieval
" check the bangin sounds that i invent , marvelous...
check - - check , marvelous...
yo , yo
i can't , won't , don't stop rockin to the rhythm
droppin wisdom , for my niggas locked in prison
for those on the streets , rock ir in your system
one's restin in piece , in my heart ya livin
representin all those who ain't got a pot to piss in
went from small timer to a top position
i'm not kiddin , so what ? radio's not mixin
while shots whistlin , niggas on my block listen
to the uncontrolled , mentally hold you p.o.w
comin through , ain't no good , ain't no love for you
cameleons play the wrong side of the fence
switchin like clark kent when the drama commence
ladies and gent's , my poetry's beyond intense
find me in the trench , while you hold your spot on the bench
best invest in me , favored heavenly
i.n.s. , address me , as your excellency
successfully defendin my belt with first rounders
where close friends get treated the same as out - of - towners
" check - - check - - check - - check the bangin sounds that i invent...
check - - check - - check - - check - - check - - check...
check the bangin - - the bangin - - the bangin...
jurrasic insides , i rise above the norm'
urban icon , ridin on the eye of the storm
veteran form , spaz like memories of 'nam
duckin bombs on the rendezvous with miss saigon
calm assassin , showin my face so they can know
when on beatstreet , i paint a picture like raymo
on the lay - low , makin dough , aimin to blow
got away to go , so i'm just takin it slow
echoin in the ghetto , throughout the metro
'bout to let it go , give me some room to elbow
watch bitches stick to a nigga like velcro
yo , the plan is to grap what i can within my reach
expand like the crystal white sands that fill the beach
with my hand on the piece , one eye is on the beast
through the rhyme i teach history class and move the mass
..
i can't , won't , don't stop rockin to the rhythm
droppin wisdom , for my niggas locked in prison
for those on the streets , rock ir in your system
one's restin in piece , in my heart ya livin *echo*
i can't , won't , don't stop rockin to the rhythm
droppin wisdom , for my niggas locked in prison
for those on the streets , rock ir in your system
one's restin in piece , in my heart ya livin *echo*
