i've seen the world , done it all
had my cake now
diamonds , brilliant , and bel air now
hot summer nights , mid - july
when you and i were forever wild
the crazy days , city lights
the way you'd play with me like a child
will you still love me when i'm no longer young and beautiful ?
will you still love me when i got nothing but my aching soul ?
i know you will , i know you will , i know that you will
will you still love me when i'm no longer beautiful
i've seen the world , lit it up as my stage now
channeling angels in the new age now
hot summer days , rock and roll
the way you'd play for me at your show
and all the ways i got to know
your pretty face and electric soul
will you still love me when i'm no longer young and beautiful ?
will you still love me when i got nothing but my aching soul ?
i know you will , i know you will , i know that you will
will you still love me when i'm no longer beautiful
dear lord , when i get to heaven
please let me bring my man
when he comes , tell me that you'll let him in
father tell me if you can
all that grace , all that body
all that face makes me wanna party
he's my sun , he makes me shine like diamonds
will you still love me when i'm no longer young and beautiful ?
will you still love me when i got nothing but my aching soul ?
i know you will , i know you will , i know that you will
will you still love me when i'm no longer beautiful
will you still love me when i'm no longer beautiful ?
will you still love me when i'm not young and beautiful ?
