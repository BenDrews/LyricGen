you want me to die , but i'm alive
you won't survive if you ain't on my side
you don't wanna war
i'm trained to kill
dead him on sight
all black double r , get him on bike
you won't hear my weapon on strike
i ain't the get along type
these breddas want stripes , they better not set upon i
show me a bit of respect , i'll flip in a sec
god told me forgive and forget but i know this nigga's address
if i type that in the sat nav
i'll be there soon in a three - door hatchback
i've been doing this music ting for a minute now
this just seems like a flashback
but it's so for real , you know deal , i road the steel
i ain't going to go home with guilt cause
you want me to die , but i'm alive
you won't survive if you ain't on my side
you don't wanna war
i'm trained to kill
like i was in the army
same regime since 18
but i was in wars before that
no vest on , that's what i call rawback
if you don't know where the war's at
come outside , it's right here on your doormat
knock knock , who's there ? ghetts
ghetts who ? gets you
i gone mine , so where's your strap ?
i'm a serious guy , you're borat
if you're sure that you're bad
i store mash in a whore's flat where the floor's cracked
this poor lad couldn't be more gassed
never knew he would get smoked like a scorebag
warned him once but he chose to ignore that
you want me to die , but i'm alive
you won't survive if you ain't on my side
you don't wanna war
you want me to die , but i'm alive
you won't survive if you ain't on my side
you don't wanna war
i'm trained to kill
it's like they want me to die
forcing my hand
forcing a retaliation
i'm easy
but i will warn you
i'd just rather live life
make music
make dough
but man have got me on a next ting
dead - dead him on sight
winters get hot , if i see my man
in the internet shop , dead - dead him online
shoot the boy , leave the computer moist
clockwork , dead him on time
when shots burst 7 from 9
i get pleasure from crime , forever on hype
dead - dead - dead dead - dead - dead - dead - dead - dead him
take it old school and b - b - behead him
take him local and cave his whole chest in
bruce lee with the 1 - inch punch
not me but bullets might come in a bunch
rats wanna back boy dem ?
rat poison come in a lunch
i might come through bunning a blunt
chilled out , ready to kill now
you want me to die , but i'm alive
you won't survive if you ain't on my side
you don't wanna war
i'm trained to kill
i'm trained to kill
i'm trained to kill ( you want me to die )
i'm trained to kill ( but i'm alive )
i'm trained to kill ( you won't survive if you ain't on my side )
i'm trained to kill ( you don't wanna war )
i'm trained to kill
