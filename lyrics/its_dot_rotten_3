inhale exhale i’m tired of it
i don’t wanna breathe
i just wanna leave
or i’ll be stuck here till my soul flies
inhale exhale i’m tired of it
i don’t wanna breathe
what’s the point in being here
i just wanna leave
can you show me to the pain killer killer killer
i’ll be searching for a pain killer killer killer
can you show me to the pain killer killer killer
i been looking for a pain killer killer killer
overload
overload
they want us to do as we’re told
distract us from the truth so we can lose as they grow
i put life on the line that’s just the way we role
head spinning heads spinning
it’s a overload
you might see me behaving crazy
you might see me behaving road
sometimes i wonder to myself what’s going on am i all on my own
oh i’ve been feelin something’s going on around us
but we just can’t see it too many lights when the truth is needed
you been playing games
you are planning to destroy everything we have made
everything we come upon you leave it in the grave
truth is i don’t wanna fly in the air
the world i’m in’s collapsing why am i here
i need a pain killer and time to prepare
i swear
inhale exhale i’m tired of it
i don’t wanna breathe
i just wanna leave
or i’ll be stuck here till my soul flies
inhale exhale i’m tired of it
i don’t wanna breathe
what’s the point in being here
i just wanna leave
can you show me to the pain killer killer killer
i’ll be searching for a pain killer killer killer
can you show me to the pain killer killer killer
i been looking for a pain killer killer killer
overload
masters of the system
they make the decisions
we’re programmed to obey
we’re programmed to listen
the masses are the victims
they got us in this prison
so now my heads spinning heads spinning
it’s a overload
they want us to do as we’re told
distract us from the truth so we can lose as they grow
i put life on the line that’s just the way we role
head spinning heads spinning
it’s a overload
