here we go , it’s just the start
yet we know , we’ve come so far
we weren't here at the beginning
but here we are , looking up at the sky
admiring the disappearing stars
and we can watch the clouds turn black
before we see the world explode
i don’t think that i’ll turn back
i was told this world is cold
and we can see the mountains crumble
before we hear the volcanoes
if we can't find our own way home
i will always hold you close
praying for the world
praying for the world
when the world turns to ashes
will i still be here standing
will i -
have to witness armageddon
will i -
have to witness armageddon
now ?
ohhhh...
have to witness armageddon , now ? x 4
tell me how we guna win
we never talk of loss
the bridge of love is burning
we can only look across
now i'm screaming out for help
i never thought we’d fail
so i'm believing in myself
now hands up
i'm praying for the world ( hands up now )
i'm praying for the world
feeling confused
don’t know what its all about
tryna to keep my head together
london bridge is falling down
baby are you with me
i don’t need the pity
just help me ride this wave
we can take down liberty city
cuz our world is going crazy
you can see what its like now
when the sky turns black
there's no longer a white house
how you sleeping on our world
when we’re wide awake
and my energy will take you higher than the empire state
but , nothings going to plan
leaning tower of pisa
screaming out that i need ya
it's breathing out of my speakers
i feel it down in my ether ?
amazing as it felt
your playing with my health
and now you got me
praying for the world
praying for the world
