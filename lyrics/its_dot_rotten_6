let me set it off from the get go
on the neck
yes
rep to the death
best to accept it and let go
all of them are stressed
cause i'm fresh and retro
impressed
cause i have been blessed with the best flow
they used to par me on sets , laugh at my creps
now they're hardly a threat
why ! ?
cause i said so
i'm a general
and they're all army cadets , far from my legs
ha ha
i'm ahead
they never believed in my skills
now i'm aiming at mc's like ( f - you )
that's my reason to kill
i will be the one that will be receeding to kill
is that humble pie ?
why ? !
keep eating your meal
i remember the days when
the only thing that eff'd in my brain was
thoughts of me recieving a wheeler
with my team hoping and dreaming
the scene that i begin to feel her
now it's just me
i can't take any more
the talent over here is much greater then yours
creating a storm
and wagering a war
bury you kings and queens
don't say your a pawn
no
i ain't changing my thoughts
i am , what i am
just wait for the tour
and those who showed me hatred before
tell me who's laughing now
the bass is shaking the floor
try lock me out
i'll break through the door
i'm heating it up
yeah , making it warm
i'm deep for the bus
yeah , made for the
more
war
no , i ain't changing before
i am , what i am
just wait for the tour
and those who showed me hatred before
tell me who's laughing now
i remember
remember what ? !
when i weren't heard off
getting my tune searched
my name , it was murder
no one cared
listening to radio
thinking 'fuck this'
this is so unfair
just wait for the tables to turn
i had these kids rocking
spraying my verse
i looked back to the olders now
you lot had your turn
you wasted you turn
oh well
i ain't living off status
respect is bigger then ratings
and have females kissing your..
hoo hoo
shows so cold
i was in 2 crews
had to go solo
oh , you don't know
i was behind my peers
laughing about - saying that i won't blow
now they can't par
cause i get the last laugh
sitting back like
ha ha
