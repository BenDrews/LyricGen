here's a 3 minutes story , that will last more than the last time
for your hi - fi , ears tingle sounds like a single , it's got the right vibe
i ride in the clouds when it's high time
looking around at the bright sky
i feel like an alien staring down at the earth and my life's like a si - fi
the time that we have is precious
buying the seconds , is this a slice of heaven
have i the right intention
i ain't impressed with hate or a violent message
surrounded by connections , timeless friendship
smiling like our life is stress less
we're moving in the right direction
keep it on a low
we're just over here stacking up some paper
we are planning live greater... but we just
keep it on a low
we've been through some ups and downs
when there was no love around
we rolled through the underground but
keep it on a low
if i showed you what it's like , will i really be your type , your chilling with me tonight but
keep it on a low
my whole families inside , in this rave there's a vibe , its minarmy but quite
keep it on a low
key to the game got it locked like a locksmith
i'm about top notch watch when i drop this
venom and toxi rhymes , with a goblin mind
you'll see dot close by were the boss is
came from streets filled with sirens coppers , violent shooters , blocks full of crime
i was grimy obvious
now my work is reside inside the office , rising the profit , why should i stop this
brought into success , i've been adopted
dots gonna shine , till your eyes go blind and your tired of watching
it's about time there admiring rotten
volume louder right when i'm cotching
when i drive by you cry like a lost kid
got your life savings twice in my pocket but just
i'm spitting these righteous opinions that are taught to educate nations , thats what i rep
i do this and it's not coz the pays high
not for a chain just to say that i stay fly
not coz i think that the game is amazing
not for the fame or to stay in your brain as a favourite
not coz i think that i'm the greatest. it's basic
my music is a lot for the rave nights , so i stay glowing as often as day light
you should
