hello it's me
bringing you poetry
mr righteous opinions with lyrics i been known to teach
the world will soon know of me
london to overseas
i made it here even though i was told that i won't achieve
nah' , i never listened
i guess to rise , you only need heart
and a smart mind
at hard times , don't show your weak cards
i knew it , i got this gift for something
you need to listen up , when this is pumping
imagine this is just the introduction....
hello , its me ( it's me )
if i died today would you miss me ? ( miss me )
it's me ( it's me )
it's me ( it's me )
why should i tell who it is ? it's me ( it's me )
hello...
this is the introduction
for this kid from london
even a nostradamus script
didn't predict this coming
i use to wish , scribbling , with pen in my grip , was struggling
that i'd make it big
but then i saw my peers get big for nothing
so i had to step out
put my head back in production
found myself in the studio daily , with no interruptions
had my talks with all the elders
they're like 60 - something
big discussions
giving me advice to keep the mission running
so i shut up and listened
and they just kept the wisdom coming
and trying to minus out all the negatives cause i've been distracted
adjusting to fame cause they're loving the name
but it's uffin' insane
before the deal , they'd rather kill than kiss and hug him
i just tell 'em chill
only the wife on road can link her husband
if you see me with mr. sheeran
just know that he's my ginger cousin
if you ain't in minarmy i'll hear you and just think of flushing
to all you haters can give me suction
fuck it...
i lied and told you on the album there was no collabs
but i had to bring in lolly ellis
love has to get shown to fam
cause we've been through some situations
on the roads that were over amped
and prevailed cause we failed to lose and get ourselves involved in gangs
and we've always had visions
but never had the dough for plans
but now we're older
no weight on our shoulder and we over - stand
just what the plan is
we be making bangers
screw face for the cameras but still i'll be showing manners
while i'm rolling through these manors
'eff a chain thats hanging
i'll pull up and roll a j with you on any day we're jamming
but there's scheming bruddas planning
their thought process is
i can't wait to catch him
but they ain't in the greece
as in the athens
you hear it in my accent
usually it ain't cause rappers shouldn't have this passion
but me , i just keep it cracking
me being here's a mad thing
so prepare for the rap king
you should be fair in this black skin
from the area clapham
it's me , it's me , hello ( x4 )
