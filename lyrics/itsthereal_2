blocka , blocka , blocka
sun's out , guns out
blocka , blocka , blocka
sun's out , guns out
might not look it , but i'm always down to fight
meet you out back , no rules , just right , hardbody
my arms are noodles , manicotti
but i could beat up kids as long as they don't take karate
you want heat ? well , i'll turn it up a notch
catch bodies like a fireman on suicide watch
skinny as a rail , but my uzis weigh a ton
so i'm throwing more hands than a girl on vh1
third base on your face : finger banging
looking for a high - five , don't leave me hanging
i'm jewish , and i pull trigs
but i'm not kosher , so i'll smoke pigs
shoot a boy in blue ; call it 'pop a smurf'
turn you to an ostrich ; put your head in the earth
i don't wanna push , so watch your fucking manners
you think i'm clark kent , but i'm really david banner
blocka , blocka , blocka
sun's out , guns out
blocka , blocka , blocka
sun's out , guns out
i take care of my girls , i'm the bird feeder
but when the weather turns nice , i got a wife beater
see me pumping iron in the streets , my arms are 9 millimeters
you don't wanna get sprayed because i'm carrying two liters
at the mall , it's going down
call it target practice , giving out pounds
any tools looking for trouble better watch their tone
homey depot the way i carry the chrome
strapped like a baby seat in my vw van
my power pellets get you ghost the way that i pack , man
attitude like napoleon and dynamite in my hands
when my llamas get to spitting , i'm like " tina , eat your ham ! "
any jokers try to step up to my camelot
watch your mouth or you'll get touched up like photoshop
i'm a socialist , free tickets to the gun show
meet my pacifists : glock 9 and calico !
blocka , blocka , blocka
sun's out , guns out
blocka , blocka , blocka
sun's out , guns out
who is your rap sampson , i can't flop , my pair's strong
i can't stop , like tank tops , a pair of arms
used to set up shop on bad blocks with crack rock
now i bring fury to laptops with rap songs
neil armstrong , all bars outer space
our arms are strong , your arms outta shape
you're lightweight ; i'm heavyweighted
i'm like christmas : i'm celebrated in every state
( the sun is out ) when we come out
the girlies wanna come cause the dough never run out
unlimited bars , yeah the flow never run out
when i pull the gun out , y'all better run out
i'm a rap star with the heat out
might sleep with your girl , but never eat out
summertime , no doubt , arms always be out
team early just murdered the track , now we out
blocka , blocka , blocka
sun's out , guns out
blocka , blocka , blocka
sun's out , guns out
