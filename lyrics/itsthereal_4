sameoldshawn : how'd you guys get the idea to do that , anyway ? new ones for every interview ?
eric rosenthal , itsthereal : new ones ? the original idea was , we had a video we did that was based off of world star antics that we would see , and specifically in a young berg video
jeff rosenthal , itsthereal : young berg had gotten his chain stolen.
er : his brother was threatening people online
jr : but had , like , six a.k.a.'s in a row. and so then we were like , what would be the lamest approach for us to do it ? and so it was us , talking about how i had gotten my chain stolen , and how this person , whoever stole my chain , needs to give it back , because...
er : because why would you wear a chain with someone else's name on it ?
jr : you don't know what goes on above 72nd street
er : so that was the video we did probably three years beforehand , or two years beforehand. and when we started doing the mtv interviews with different people like stevie wonder , vinnie from jersey shore , or dwight howard , or alice cooper , or whoever , we decided that we were going to give ourselves an identity , and that it was going to change every time. and it got more and more ridiculous as we went on. it's a fun exercise for us to try and outwit each other and surprise each other with it , and then hopefully surprise the viewers too
and the best thing was that someone on tumblr who was a fan of ours put together a list of all of the a.k.a.'s right in a row , which was pretty great
