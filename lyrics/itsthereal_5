let me show you the high life ( high life )
we tossing money outta private flights ( private flights )
tell my mama i'll be alright ( be alright )
we cashing funemployment checks tonight
cards from grandma , and the government
money mcnuggets , you know i'm lovin' it
every day is casual , i gotta show out
throw wads at the gods , make it rain in a drought
i dress for the job i want : none
pockets obese , my pants weigh a ton
shirts half off , girls balling in the bargain bin
aisle five at target is usually what targeting
one zero , zero , comma , comma , lost count
rims on the atm , pimp my bank account
taking blank checks , i'm scribbling in the margins
nba playbook : i'm reaching in and charging
i made it out the desert with my whips and chains
noah's ark attitude : gimme two of everything
i always live well , but now i'm living welfare
messing with the banks like a fresh prince , bel air
let me show you the high life ( high life )
we tossing money outta private flights ( private flights )
tell my mama i'll be alright ( be alright )
we cashing funemployment checks tonight
i don't say i'm outta work , i say i'm non - profit
my uncle sam spots me , direct deposit
lifestyles of has - beens , and never - will - bes
i might not be rich , but i'm filthy
strutting like i showered , don't be mad at me
i hit the grocery store , doors open automatically
my women in linen , i take 'em fine dining
eating lobster in the back ; dumpster diving
i make it rain in my dreams : i'm a bed wetter
my friends got fired too , call me a trendsetter
ballin' like boche , my versace posse
playing games on my boat , i nicknamed it yahtzee
pockets fat , your bitch sniffing my crotch
jumped into my neighbor's pool and flooded my watch
i'm my own boss now , and i ask a lot of me
why work a 9 - to - 5 , when every week i win the lottery ?
let me show you the high life ( high life )
