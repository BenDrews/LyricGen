yeah , motherfuckers ! ( yeah ! )
itsthereal , bitch ! ( bitch ! )
lil jon , bitch !
i make raps
just to make dough
just to make liquor
just to make clothes
just to make movies
which pays more dough
and now i'm rich , fly , and drunk
and i forgot how to rap
i'm retiring before my first release date
rap was a building block , but now i fuck with real estate
working construction , yeah , that's how i raise the roof
i'm out there selling alcohol , it's called recession proof
i'm not a rapper , go ahead and check my taxes
i got a masters in cutting , i'm teaching classes
i do this for my mother's hair , now it relaxes
building closets , they got racks and racks and rackses
clothing line crazy : ron artest fleece
match my purple and gold metta jesus piece
i'm the grand cherokee , designing custom jeeps
drove my talents all the way down to south beach
turned nothing into stunting ; ego self made
steady drinking on that itsthereal kool - aid
oh yeah , i'm a man of many hats
i'm into selling out , not into selling raps
x2
fuck rapping , dog ; rapping is for rappy rappers
man , i'm just an actor
make movies , make money , then screw it
make time for someone else to do it
selling out's an art form , i'm in the louvre
i'm just proving i've got nothing else to prove - ah
got a clothing line that everyone should know about
got a red wine everyone bordeauxs about
fuck hellman's , man , i'm grey poupon
shouldn't let me on the plane , my shoes are the bomb
see me tweeting and i'm looking verified
no matter where i go , i got a check by my side
i'm retired , hang my jersey in the rafters
forget rapping ; cash is what i'm after
being so clear as i make my great escape...
enjoy the rest of the mixtape !
x2
bye , bitches
bye , bitches !
rich , fly , drunk
i could still rap though
