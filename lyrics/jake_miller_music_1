yeah
the other day i got an email , almost didn't read it
but something caught my eye right before i could delete it
it was bold and underlined , " please read " was the title
followed by " jake you are my idol "
it said and i quote , " my name is nikki and i used to be a dancer
until the doctor diagnosed me with cancer
so i said goodbye to all the hair on my head
and hello to my hospital bed
yeah , see , i was just a normal girl , it happened so fast
there were so many days that i thought would be my last
however , the fight was tough , and the battle was long
but i felt strong when i listened to your songs
you were always there for me , you helped my heart beat
you were my only friend , kept you on repeat
i thank god for you every single night
'cause believe or not , you saved my life "
i've met a million people , been a million places
shook a million hands , seen a million faces
i've had a million lows , and a million more highs

yeah , the mailman knocked , said it was for me
handed me a box , sent from tennessee
written on the top " for jake's eyes only "
inside was a journal and letter that he wrote me
it said , " my name is dillon i'm in 7th grade
i'm ridiculed and picked on almost everyday
yeah , they push me in the halls in between my classes
yesterday they took my books , then broke my glasses
i got no one to talk to , it's like i don't exist
sometimes i wonder if i was gone , would i be missed ?
but lemme tell the real reason for this letter
you've helped me through it all , you help me feel better
your words give confidence , your message is inspiring
you help me find my inner strength deep inside me
through all the bad times , you helped me find the light
believe or not , you saved my life "

i was sittin' at my table at dinner the other night
when i noticed a little girl sittin' to my right
she was lookin' at me like she knew me , i guess she did
'cause then she walked right up to me , and then she said
" my name is sami and i swear that i'm your biggest fan "
i think she even had my name written on her hand
she said , " me and my brother used to listen to you every day
until last year , when he passed away
i'll never forget seein' my parents cry
when they got a call sayin' that your son had died
man , i wish that he was here now , you were his favorite
he had your mixtape and never stopped playin' it
your music gives me a feelin' that i just can't describe
it's like i got my brother back , and hes still alive
i pray for both of you , every single night
'cause believe or not , you saved my life "

now lemme turn the table , and talk to you
i had a dream , but you're the reason that its comin' true
yeah , i've had some dark days , when the sun don't shine
but you always reminded me that i would be fine
'cause when no else cared , you believed in my vision
and now i got an army comin' with me on my mission
i thank god for all you , every single night
'cause believe or not , you saved my life
