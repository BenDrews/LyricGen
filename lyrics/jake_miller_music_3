it seems like the world is testing me
will i conquer , or will it get the best of me ?
half of the world sees success in me
the half other is second guessing me
but i kid you not don't mess with me
cause i think i got something possed in me
no matter what i'm gonna give whats left in me
i didn't choose this life it was destiny
now i'm feeling like i might go psycho
stand back , cause i'm feelin like i might blow
slim chance , but i'm putting up a fight though
they tell me this the wrong path but i know its right , though
i'm about to pick up the world and shake it
throw it to the ground and laugh as i break it
let the whole world know that i'm gonna make it
and if you don't give it to me then i'm gonna take it
beast mode , i'm in beast mode
gunning for the top , cock back reload
i'm a new man with a new attitude
but don't get me wrong i'm still me though
i'm all in now , i ain't bluffing
i risk everything , regret nothing
my determinations disgusting
so everyday my ass i'm busting
lemme take ya back , break it down
just a couple more months then college bound
got a scholarship , my bags were packed
then my world turned upside down
when i got that phone call , so shocking
i thought my heart was stopping
are you serious ? there's a once in life time opportunity knocking
but wait , what now ? i thought i had my life figured out
everything i was once sure about was now skepticism and doubt
almost lose control , lost sanity
meanwhile my friends abandoned me
i felt lost in the world for a little bit
i had nobody but my family
but i bounced back and got in the zone
late nights , just me and the microphone
my friends were off at college while i was right here sitting here at home
they were partying i was cutting tracks
they were going out i was making stacks
this the road i choose so you know i'm gonna walk it proudly and never look back
now fast forward a couple years
most of my fears have disappeared
after the blood , the sweat , the tears , i dedicate this right here
to all my non - believers and haters
y'all doing me nothing but favors
keep talking , i can't hear you
someone go get me a translator
it used to get to me , to the old me
think you can do it better ? then show me
those who know me least have the most say
don't judge me if you don't know me
whether i'm a billioanire or flat broke
you think that matters ? is that a joke ?
if you ain't got talent , you really think the money will get you anywhere ? nope
oh , you wanna play music monopoly ?
i've mastered the game , no topping me
taking over the world while the money adds up
i'm just passing and going , there's no stopping me
i've worked so hard , i earned it
it's mine now and i'll never return it
i'mma do it , i'mma do it so damn big
everyday my fans confirm it
so blast off i'm outta here
outta this world to the atmosphere
so long , i'm gone
been a hell of a ride , what a year
it's just the start , the beginning
the top of the very first inning
no need for a call to the bull pen
bottom of the 9th and i'll still be winning
what i went through , it was worth it all
all the times being pinned up against the wall
trying to please my family , friends and fans
when its all said and done , after all
i gotta do what's right for me
i gotta chase after this dream
i'm so proud of us , how we far came
me and my whole damn team
god , i'm just doing my best
for real , i feel so blessed
i think somebody's watching over me
tell me world , did i pass your test ?
did i do this right ? please tell me
i need you now , please help me
cause life don't come with no manual
i played the cards that you dealt me
my life is on the line every time i rhyme
always on my grind , 24/7
so much on my mind , someone please remind
me that i'll be fine where i'm heading
to the fans , my life i owe you
so close to my heart i hold you
but to anyone who ever doubted me
i'm so proud to say that i told you
