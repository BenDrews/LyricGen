yeah now i'm rocking with the best , pass me the mic and turn me up
bound to blow any moment now , i'm bound to self destruct
man i'm just a normal dude with far from normal dreams
doing donuts in the whip , i ain't talking krispy kreme
so sit back and watch me kill it , a dynasty rebuilding
we taking over the world , yeah i know you feel it
man this life i live is crazy , and maybe a little chaotic
but i'm living out my dream even though my dream's psychotic
cause , ain't nobody ever really do it like me
come and take a walk in my shoes , you'll see
i never show no mercy i torture the mic and murder the beat
i shut it down in your city
windows down when you bump this
i'm circling around the map like christopher columbus
man , i'm crossing off my bucket list
soon i'mma need another one and when i'm done
i might just do them all again , just for fun
we pour it up , pour it up
then me and my team we down them
we 'bout to change the world
if your looking for the best i found them
baby lets go
risking everything for everything
gotta go to hell to make your way to heaven
i'm married to the game but i never had a wedding
i'm more of a menace than dennis , i'm independent
messing with the great whites , working late nights
little recognition , that takes time
i make rhymes , never waste time
i found my dreams , and i chase mine
i've been up , i've been down
beat the competition like chris brown
don't close your eyes you'll miss out on me
making it , my momma been proud
i never lie , but i'm just the truth
killing tracks when i'm in the booth
they say rap is dead , rap is dead
but i disagree cause i'm breathing proof
better hide your girl when i'm in the room
cause i'll make her mine and i'll be the groom
i'mma need a broom to clean up the game
cause everybody nowadays care about the fame
i'm on one , i'm the real deal
my music help me to pay bills
so hungry i could eat eight meals
i'll never know how being fake feels
i've seen debt but i'm still blessed
no bath salts but i eat flesh
i'm so fresh , i get no rest
i'm grinding to make progress
your rap is whack , where the passion at ?
you're blowing up , man there's not a chance
you got a bit of chance , got a beat and check
been around the world , i've been there and back
i'm a lyrical mastermind , one of a kind , you'll never find
anybody with a - - wait hold up , cut the track and rewind
baby , everyday is a party , sometimes i think i'm tripping
just trynna keep my head from getting big like stewie griffin
man , i'm married to the game , holy matrimony
you say that you going ham ? best believe i go bologna
cause if you ain't heard of me , then i think we need to talk
man , i bet you live with patrick cause you living under a rock
cause , ain't nobody ever really gonna do it like me
come and take a walk in my shoes , you'll see
i never show no mercy , i torture the mic and murder the beat
i walk around my city feeling like a mayor
i'm worldwide baby , just like the equator
man , i'm living like i'm dying , but i haven't even hit 20
i'm living like a millionaire but i barely made a penny
i'll take a break when i die , no stopping by any means
cause what's the point of sleeping , when you're living your dreams
