i'd love to stick around , but i can't waste time
so i told her after my show , we can face time
i feel my phone buzzin' while i'm doing sound check
gotta take a rain check , so i can make a paycheck
she always tellin' me , i don't know where to draw the line
missin' calls all the time , always gotta hit decline
she told me hit the brakes , she dont like the new me
won't come on the road with me , cause that makes her a groupie
all she wanna do is get some dinner and a movie
but i'm just tryin' make it , you dont like it , baby , sue me
she said , " i'm sick of it , honestly i've had it
why dont you go try to win the lotto while your at it ?
your chasin' a kid's dream , its time for you to grow up "
but i ain't got the time to settle down , i'm tryin' blow up

yeah yeah , uh uh , hey hey
she gettin' high , gettin' high to ignore frustration
she act like she all for it , but secretly she hate it
borderline suicidal , what the f*ck could i do
in another state , and expectin' me to ride through
and drop what i'm doin' , now my day is brewin'
under the influence of love , i can't do this
i think i'm bout to lose it , i ain't tryna settle down
always hittin' on my cell , it's hella hard to get around
sayin' we should test it out , emotions , gotta let it out
always arguing about , how my head up in the clouds
and you got me blowin' now , to run away from these problems
you always cause a racket , not talkin' andy roddick
music my first love , and i'll never put it second
no that's not even a question , headed in the right direction
and i think you slow me down , i need to get out this town
( baby can we settle down ? )
hell nah , are you for real ? !

but i ain't got the time , i know how to tell her politely
yeah i know you're missing me
baby girl , i get it
but i'm just tryna live my dream , can't you give me credit ?
you said you're missing my voice , well then turn on your radio
she said , " i'm sick and tired of blowing kisses through my stereo "
beggin' me to meet her , while i'm 30 , 000 feet up
i got too much on my plate , ha , i'm tryna eat up
water works every time i cancel reservations
messing with her heart like i'm playin' operation
tellin' me , " i wish you had a normal ocupation "
but i'm on my grind , tryna get a grammy nomination
now your givin' ultimatums , either music or you
is it too much to ask to have my cake and eat it too
" your chasein' a kid's dream , its time for you to grow up "
but i ain't got the time to settle down , i'm tryin' blow up

won't you settle down with me , settle down
we can settle at a table
