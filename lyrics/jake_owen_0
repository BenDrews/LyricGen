well i grew up in a real town
where the prom queen had a plastic crown
and we really did just drive around
cause there wasn't shit to do
we didn't know we were real broke
daddy rolled them real smokes
we drank rc , no real coke
our neighbor had a pool
we got green grass and a few trees
but it ain't like what's on tv
this is real life in the real world
we ain't talkin' to no models , we got real girls
we get real low , we get real high
it ain't all good , baby , but it's alright
real life
we got a dive bar with a real band
they play too loud and they're real bad
but we're real bored so we still dance
and we stay out way too late
hit the waffle house for some real food
but that waitress , she's real rude
she got real problems , but we do too
so we tip her anyway
that's just the way that it is
that's just the way that we live
this is real life in the real world
we ain't talkin' to no models , we got real girls
we get real low , we get real high
it ain't all good , baby , but it's alright
real life
yeah , we're lovin' real life
we find real love , get real hurt
fall real hard , shake off the dirt
pray to god , let's make a deal
i guess it just got real
we get real low , we get real high
it ain't all good , baby , but it's alright
real life
this ain't no fairy tale
it's real life
