if your dream house
is a double - wide trailer sitting back in the holler
on a country road
then baby , that's where we'll go
if you don't wanna settle down
we can bounce around from town to town
and that's fine with me
if you wanna just ride the breeze
i'll go anywhere
west virginia , baby i don't care
mexico on a wild hair
have you ever seen california
pick a spot on any old map
i travel light and my bags are packed
just as long as i'm where you're at
i'm gonna have a real good view
i'll go anywhere , anywhere with you
i'll bet there's a two lane
running right through the middle
of a wide open desert to a ghost town
if you wanna just hide out
we could send a postcard back
from a mountain top out in idaho
maybe get snowed in
anytime baby you say when
i'll go anywhere
west virginia , baby i don't care
mexico on a wild hair
have you ever seen california
pick a spot on any old map
i travel light and my bags are packed
just as long as i'm where you're at
i'm gonna have a real good view
i'll go anywhere , anywhere with you
i'll go anywhere
west virginia , baby i don't care
mexico on a wild hair
have you ever seen california
pick a spot on any old map
i travel light and my bags are packed
just as long as i'm where you're at
i'm gonna have a real good view
i'll go anywhere , anywhere with you
girl i'll swear
just say the word
i'll take you there
aww anywhere , anywhere with you
yeah i'll go anywhere with you
