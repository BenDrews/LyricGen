i pick her up about 7 for the football game
my camaro all painted up in flames
but damn , she was the one that was on fire
she was head - to - toe red , white and blue
that lipstick , tank top , daisy dukes
she had my head spinning faster than them four bald eagle tires
i was all caught up in that american love
two young hearts , one cool car
and all we wanted to do was park , kiss , smoke , drink
i love this song , baby , what do you think ?
she turned it up , windows fogging up
we were living it up , up , up in that american love
i parked the chevy by the levy on a friday night
we were naming all the stars up in that sky
and i named the brightest one right after her
and the summer sunset was something to see
with her leaning all up real close to me
and with a six pack , the next thing i knew , we were in the backseat , you know
american love
two young hearts , one cool car
and all we wanted to do was park , kiss , smoke , drink
i love this song , baby , what do you think ?
she turned it up , windows fogging up
we were living it up , up , up in that american love
we got american love
two young hearts , one cool car
and all we wanted to do was park , kiss , smoke , drink
i love this song , baby , what do you think ?
she turned it up windows fogging up
we were living it up , up , up in that american love
park , kiss , smoke , drink
love this song , baby , what do you think ?
she turned it up , windows fogging up
we were living it up , up , up in that american love
that's that love right there
stars and stripes
red , white and blue
daisy dukes
snailed it , haha , snailed it
yeah man
