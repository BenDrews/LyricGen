a full moon shining bright
edge of the water ; we were feeling alright
back down a country road
the girls are always hot , and the beer is ice cold
cadillac , horns on the hood
my buddy frankie had his dad hook him up good
girls smile when we roll by
they hop in the back , and we cruise to the river side
never gonna grow up
never gonna slow down
we were shinin' like lighters in the dark
in the middle of a rock show
we were doin' it right
we were comin' alive
yeah , caught up in a southern summer , a barefoot , blue jean night
blue eyes and auburn hair
sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
new to town , and new to me
her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
shot me in love like a shootin' star
so , i grabbed a beer and my ol' guitar
then we sat around till the break of dawn
howlin' and singin' our favorite song
never gonna grow up
never gonna slow down
we were shinin' like lighters in the dark
in the middle of a rock show
we were doin' it right
we were comin' alive
yeah , caught up in a southern summer , a barefoot , blue jean night
never gonna grow up
never gonna slow down
we were shinin' like lighters in the dark
in the middle of a rock show
we were doin' it right
we were comin' alive
yeah , caught up in a southern summer , a barefoot , blue jean night
( whoa - oh )
barefoot , blue jean night
( whoa - oh )
a barefoot , blue jean night
( whoa - oh )
barefoot , blue jean night
a barefoot , blue jean night
it's a barefoot , blue jean night
a barefoot , blue jean night
