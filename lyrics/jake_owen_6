when the sun went down , all the storefronts shut
they roll the sidewalks up around here
it's just kids and the cops out after 7 o'clock
so you better had already bought your beer
you cut your headlights off trying to not get caught
she's out the window and across the yard
she slid it into the seat , slow rolled it down the street
'til you parked it and the stereo starts
and they say
nothing good ever happens after midnight
well maybe midnight's just misunderstood
cause if nothing good ever happens after midnight
why did it always feel so damn good ?
wrapped up so tight with me , no light
all night , it was alright , alright
you go as fast as you can , go as far as you want
with nobody out to slow you down
she was your rearview queen , you were her ghost street king
while everybody was asleep in the town
you watch the red lights blink 'til the horizon's pink
all while her daddy thinks she's still in her bed
but when you're young and dumb , the only rule of thumb
was do the opposite of everything they said
and they said
nothing good ever happens after midnight
well , maybe midnight's just misunderstood
cause if nothing good ever happens after midnight
why did it always feel so damn good ?
wrapped up so tight , your own paradise
and the dashboard lights , alright , alright
they say nothing good ever happens after midnight
well maybe midnight's just misunderstood
cause if nothing good ever happens after midnight
why did it always feel so damn good ?
wrapped up so tight with me , no lights
all night , it was alright , alright
