girl , well , i don't know what kind of fool he must be
to think that he could leave you alone
and nobody would be taking you home
girl , i need to talk to you
cause i got a question , it's more like a suggestion
and here's the deal
if he ain't gonna love you
if he ain't gonna love you , i will
like you never been loved before
up against the wall when you walk in the door
looking like you wanna leave , you want some more
if he ain't gonna love you , i will
girl , well , it's obvious that something ain't right
or else you wouldn't be here tonight
and i don't wanna come on too strong
don't get me wrong
girl , i need to talk to you
cause i got a question , see , it's more like a suggestion
and here's the deal
if he ain't gonna love you
if he ain't gonna love you , i will
like you never been loved before
up against the wall when you walk in the door
looking like you wanna leave , you want some more
if he ain't gonna love you , i will
oh , girl , i will
if he ain't gonna love you
if he ain't gonna love you
if he ain't gonna love you
if he ain't gonna love you , i will
if he ain't gonna love you
if he ain't gonna love you
if he ain't gonna love you
if he ain't gonna love you
girl , i need to talk to you
cause i got a question , see , it's more like a suggestion
and here's the deal
if he ain't gonna love you
if he ain't gonna love you , i will
like you never been loved before
up against the wall when you walk in the door
looking like you wanna leave , you want some more
if he ain't gonna love you , i will
give you something you can hold onto
never gonna stop 'til the whole night's through
love you like a lover is supposed to do
if he ain't gonna love you , i will
i will , oh , girl , i will
if he ain't gonna love you , i will
