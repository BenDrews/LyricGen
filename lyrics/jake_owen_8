it's two tickets to a concert
it's a daytona airbrush t - shirt
wondering who's gonna kiss you first
you know what i'm talking about
hey baby , whatcha doing tonight ?
it's butterflies and bud lights
under the stars and on the stripes
of a beach towel in a spring break town
it's playing in the night air
through the speakers all night long
couple kids just living
that american country love song
in every town , in every place
there's a boy who's trying to take a chance
and dance and find a way to run away with her heart
in the back of an old ford truck
in the bar , just looking for love
in a pair of oh my blue eyes , let them fireworks start
that american country love song
ain't ever gonna quit playing on and on and on
it's chris loves jenny on a license plate
it's daddy getting mad cause you came home late
it's one last kiss in the driveway
hey , radio dj can you play that song that she loves
so i can turn it up and maybe turn her on
an american country love song
in every town , in every place
there's a boy who's trying to take a chance
and dance and find a way to run away with her heart
in the back of an old ford truck
in the bar , just looking for love
in a pair of oh my blue eyes , let them fireworks start
that american country love song
ain't ever gonna quit playing on , and on , and on , and on
so let's raise a glass , cheerleaders and quarterbacks
cowboys and country girls , all around this small town world
to the same old pick up lines , we've tried a million times
all the bad and good as it gets
to the ones that you ain't met yet
in every town , in every place
there's a boy who's trying to take a chance
and dance and find a way to run away with her heart
in the back of an old ford truck
in the bar , just looking for love
in a pair of oh my blue eyes , let them fireworks start
that american country love song
ain't ever gonna quit playing on , and on , and on
