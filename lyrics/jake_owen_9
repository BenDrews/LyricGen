just watching her blonde hair , sun burn , stare at them
wack caps rolling over
laid back in a thrift store beach chair
dropping limes in her corona
well she looks back , yeah , she throws me a kiss
like " honey , i sure want you "
and it's a hundred and three between her and me
and only 92 in daytona
and it's sunshine , blue eyes , tan lines , so tight
rolling white sand , cold can koozie in my hand , just a summertime strollin'
chillin' , breezin' , sippin' , singin' woah a oh , oh
beachin'
we got 2 - for - 1s , we're at a margarita bar
whatever happens happens
and there's a reggae band , full of dread heads
just sittin' in the corner laughing
well my baby walks over , drops a 20 in a jar
she smiles and shakes it at me
yeah , she gets 'em going , she gets 'em playing
a little , don't worry be happy
and it's sunshine , blue eyes , tan lines , so tight
rolling white sand , cold can koozie in my hand , just a summertime strollin'
chillin' , breezin' , sippin' , singin' woah a oh , oh
beachin'
talking 'bout
sunshine , blue eyes , tan lines , so tight
rolling white sand , cold can koozie in my hand , just a summertime strollin'
chillin' , breezin' , sippin' , singin' woah a oh , oh
beachin'
sunshine , blue eyes , tan lines , so tight
rolling white sand , cold can koozie in my hand
