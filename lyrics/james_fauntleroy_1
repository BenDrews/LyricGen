i woke up shore side , i was having trouble
remembering my name
till you said it
we've been floating here all night
still martini dry
you've been riding the same way
i can taste it
all over your lips
is this what made me forget ?
is this why i'm soaking wet ?
it doesn't even make sense
how you got me mo'nin , this early in
the mornin , oooh you got me
mo'nin. gettin lost , getting lost
getting lost , lost in the moment , yea
ooh you got me mo'nin
i look over in your eyes , wasn't thinking bout
going back to my place , till you said it
soon as you are inside
the pain in my mind was gone
got erased , i can't fake it
took all of my strength
is this what made me forget ?
is this why i'm soaking wet ?
it doesn't even make sense
how you got me mo'nin
this early in the morning
ooh you got me mo'nin , gettin lost
gettin lost gettin lost , lost in the
moment , yea , ooh you got me
mo'nin , gettin lost gettin lost gettin
lost , lost in the moment , gettin lost
ooh , i dont know where were going
babe , gettin lost gettin lost gettin lost
lost in the moment , oooh , i dont
care where were going babe , gettin
lost gettin lost gettin lost , lost in the
moment , how you got me mo'nin
this early in the morning , ooh you
got me mo'nin , gettin lost gettin lost
gettin lost , lost in the moment
ooh you got me mo'nin
