i was driving , and dozing off
didn't mean to miss your calls
where's the volume on this fucking phone ?
i don't wanna be alone
now you ain't picking up
i'm thinking about getting up
but i don't wanna be alone
and neither do you , baby
it's too crazy , how i call a million times
i just had a million things on my mind
it's you , baby
almost had a million and one this time
but i was busy , and dozing off
fucking 'round , missing calls
know that i don't wanna be alone
and neither do you , baby
i've been calling for so long
like since two , babe
and now it's five
" are you cool , babe ?
it's been a hundred thousand times , i hit you , babe
" are you alive ? " , and then i got a text reply :
saying you were sorry for dozin' off
didn't mean to miss my calls
and you don't wanna be alone
and neither do i , baby
if i saw you right here , right now , babe
i would throw the guitar right down , baby
if i saw you right here , right now , baby
but every time i lie down
is when i start dozing off
even when i'm playing the guitar
singing " i don't wanna be alone "
and neither do you , baby
it's too crazy , how i call a million times
i just had a million things on my mind
it's you , baby
almost had a million and one this time
