i finally find you
the day you ran away
crept up behind you
my hands around your waist
had to remind you
don't recognize my face
they re - assigned you
my love had been replaced
they re - designed you
don't even look the same
must've tried to blind you
switched the eyes out your face
cause now you won't see me
and now it's way too late now
children of the love
you're one of them
children of the love
don't try to run
you finally find me
i tried to hide somewhere
your love was blinding
follows you up the stairs
where you remind me
why i was even there
you re - assigned me
and then you sent me here
the crowd was listening
they didn't even know
they re - positioned
and it got into their soul
and now it's too late
you're under my control now
children of the love
don't try to run
children of the love
don't try to run
cause i hear them saying ooh ooh oh oh oh
oooh oh oh ooh
