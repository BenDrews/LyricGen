( verse 1 )
i cut my phone off
should've been cut off
way that you cut off love from me
i spent another night crying in the bed
just lying the way that you lied to me
and maybe damn i even put my plans off
just so you can put off you and me
i gave you everything
and you gave me nothing
you gave me nothing but history
( hook )
i used to be caught in the middle
between the tricks and the games and your riddles
and now i'm starting to see just a little
i'm wondering
( chorus )
what kind of idiot
sleeps on this heart of mine ?
what kind of idiot
ain't gonna realize
that i'm worth the time ?
i know you not stupid
i know i'm not stupid
so what am i doing ?
doing
what kind of idiot falls for it every time ?
so what kind of idiot am i ?
am i
am i
am i - i
so what kind of idiot am i ?
am i
am i
am i - i
so what kind of idiot am i ?
( verse 2 )
what made me think that i be the first one ?
should of been the first one to say goodbye
you broke my heart back there
i let it go back there
should of venture back when you made me cry
now that its over
how will i get over
all this dependency of you and i
i gave you everything
should've gave you nothing
damn what of waste of time
( hook )
( chorus )
( musical interlude )
