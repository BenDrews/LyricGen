met this girl on the internet , yeah
now we're sharing a cigarette
don't know her number or her real name
but what we made last night
girl they haven't invented yet
( oh no )
she just wasn't wearing nothing
like magic
something outta nothing
like magic
publicly holding hands
smoking till the stars at night are done
and the only two stars left now are you and the sun
girl , tell the preacher , " whatcha screen name ? "
and i'll say " i do "
the first baby where's your clothes
i'm happily confused
she just wasn't wearing nothing
like magic
something outta nothing
like magic
