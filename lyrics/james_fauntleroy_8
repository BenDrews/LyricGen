babe , just come here , i know you feel
and i know how you feel
and you know how i feel , c'mon
babe , just come here , i know you will
i love the way you feel
so baby if you feel alone
first , take off your clothes , so we can fuck
it's lennon roses , girl you know i heard
you've been working , but your body got a lot to say
about taking breaks and i heard every word
so much stress in your neck
girl that i feel it all in your back
this ain't no damn massage
girl you know i'm just calling it that
i heard your body call
so i'm just calling it back
you don't see nothing wrong with that
you don't feel alone
girl you , feel like home
so
babe , just come here , i know you will
i love the way you feel
so baby if you feel alone
first , let's do all the things we used to do
we already know it works
cause i've been missing you
i ain't thinking 'bout judging you
just show me what you learned
so much stress in your neck
girl i feel it all in your back
this ain't no damn massage
girl you know i'm just calling it that
i heard your body call
so i'm just calling it back
you don't see nothing wrong with that
you don't feel alone
girl you , feel like home
so
babe , just come here , i know you will
i love the way you feel
so baby if you feel alone
babe , just come here , i know you feel
and i know how you feel
and you know how i feel
