vers )
i remember lonely
he wouldn't hold me , wouldn't touch me at all
i do , and i remember crying
he was the one that left me
crying with no shoulder to use
and i remember lies
he was one of them guys
that would look me in my eyes and lie
and i was almost through
but then i ran into you
i'm just so glad i know you
( chorus )
i didn't know love until i met love
i got my hands up
what would i do if i didn't know you
running out of hope until i mend love
now i can stand up
what would i do if i didn't know you
you , what would i do if i didn't know you
what would i do if i didn't know you
what would i do if i didn't know you
( if i didn't know you )
( vers )
i remember angry
he had some issues that we couldn't work through
oh he reminded me of jealous
always accussing me and now
i bet he's jealous of you
and i remember bye bye
he was one of those guys that was in and out my life all the time
i was almost through but then i ran into you
i'm just so glad i know you
( chorus x2 )
i didn't know love until i met love
i got my hands up , what would i do if i didn't know you
running out of hope until i mend love
now i can stand up
what would i do if i didn't know you
you , what would i do if i didn't know you
what would i do if i didn't know you
what would i do if i didn't know you
( if i didn't know you )
