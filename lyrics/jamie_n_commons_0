( verse 1 )
one look , twice sold , three , four oh the way she looks at me
held up , let down , she sings me silent melodies
hair whipped , tight lipped , i’ve been calling out for you
cold sweat , once met , can’t stand the way she looks at me
( chorus 1 )
don’t you tell me no truths , i want all of your lies
don’t you tell me no truths , just all of your lies
don’t you tell me no truths , i want all of your lies
i’m wailing , so give me all of your lies
give me all of your lies
give me all of your lies
give me all of your lies
( bridge )
do the rumble and sway
do the rumble and sway
do the rumble and sway
( verse 2 )
one look , twice bold , three , four , i’m on my knees for her
held up , let down , she sings me perfect harmonies
she fakes heart breaks , i'd take just a part of you
those eyes , sweet lies , i’ve been drowning out for you
( chorus 2 )
don't you tell me no truths , i want all of your lies
don't leave your money at home , just a word to the wise
don’t you tell me no truths , i want all of your lies
i’m wailing so give me all of your lies
give me all of your lies
give me all of your lies
give me all of your lies
( chorus 1+2 )
