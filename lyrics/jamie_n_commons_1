truth be told
i'm not the man i once was
but i also know
i'm not the man i once was
search for signs between the lines
of right and wrong
all the while it seems the angels are busy
busy just singin' their song
and they're singin' !
glory , glory , hallelujah
glory , glory , hallelujah
glory , glory , hallelujah
truth be told
i feel broke down inside
long years filled with hate
and nothing to show
glory , glory , hallelujah
glory , glory , hallelujah
glory , glory , hallelujah
they're singin' !
glory , glory , hallelujah
glory , glory , hallelujah
lead me out beyond my sorrows
lead me out where i canâ€™t see
sing glory hallelujah
sing hallelujah for me
sing hallelujah for me
glory , glory , hallelujah
glory , glory , hallelujah
glory , glory , hallelujah
glory , glory , hallelujah
hear me out , you're my soul
hear me out where i can't see
sing glory hallelujah
sing hallelujah for me
sing hallelujah for me
