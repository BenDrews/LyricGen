up in the north where the cold winds blow
over the prairie gold
theres a church bell screaming
on the steeple high
gather ye children of men
with one hand on the trigger , one hand on the cross
jesus and his family are two things he's lost
march him to the scaffold and string him up on high
the call came out from the crowd
theres blood in their eyes and blood in their hearts
for , the blood turning dry on his hands
with one hand on the trigger , one hand on the cross
jesus and his family are two things he's lost
christ oh lord what have you done
you won't never see heaven or kingdom come
christ oh lord what have you done
you won't never see heaven or kingdom come
listen to me my wayward flock
he cried with a noose round his neck
i spoke to the lord on the mountain top
his bidding was all i could do
i spoke to the lord on the mountain top
his bidding was all i could do
christ oh lord your works been done
now show me heaven or kingdom come
christ oh lord your works been done
now show me heaven or kingdom come
one hand on the trigger , one hand on the cross
jesus and his family are two things he's lost
