i heard all i needed
cannot fight the signs
i can taste the blood there
i can taste the lies
i can see the sorrow
i can't find the light
see the angel of death there
she slowly came into town
just when you thought that the war was won
just when you thought the race was done
it's coming back 'round , it's coming back 'round
it's coming back 'round to get you
karma
karma
what goes around comes back around
so when i see you again , i'm gonna put you down
karma
karma
what goes around comes back around
so when i see you again , i'm gonna put you down
why don't you hold your hands up ?
why don't you take your stance ?
you should have let me die there
you should have took your chance
i feel a turning in tide now
i feel it fade to black
i take the sun from your stars man
now you can't look back
just when you thought that the war was won
just when you thought the race was done
it's coming back 'round , it's coming back 'round
it's coming back 'round to get you
