i met her in a club down in north soho
where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry cola
see - o - l - a cola
she walked up to me and she asked me to dance
i asked her name and in a dark brown voice she said , " lola "
l - o - l - a lola , lo lo lo lo lola
well , i'm not the world's most physical guy
but when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
oh my lola , lo lo lo lo lola
well , i'm not dumb but i can't understand
why she walk like a woman and talk like a man
oh my lola , lo lo lo lo lola , lo lo lo lo lola
well , we drank champagne and danced all night
under electric candlelight
she picked me up and sat me on her knee
and said , " little boy won't you come home with me ? "
well , i'm not the world's most passionate guy
but when i looked in her eyes
well i almost fell for my lola
lo lo lo lo lola , lo lo lo lo lola
lola lo lo lo lo lola lo lo lo lo lola
i pushed her away. i walked to the door
i fell to the floor. i got down on my knees
i looked at her , and she at me
well that's the way that i want it to stay
and i always want it to be that way for my lola
lo lo lo lo lola
girls will be boys , and boys will be girls
it's a mixed up , muddled up , shook up world
except for lola. lo lo lo lo lola
well i left home just a week before
and i've never ever kissed a woman before
but lola smiled and took me by the hand
and said , " little boy , gonna make you a man. "
well i'm not the world's most masculine man
but i know what i am and i'm glad i'm a man
and so is lola
lo lo lo lo lola. lo lo lo lo lola
lola lo lo lo lo lola. lola lo lo lo lo lola
