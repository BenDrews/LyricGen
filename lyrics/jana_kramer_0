i saw your picture in a paper
honeymoon in jamaica , she's a lucky girl
you look so grown up in your black tux , from a ballcap in a pick up seems like another world
you and me and our big dreams , falling in love
we were two kids in the backseat , all fearless and young
i got the first kiss and she'll get the last
she's got the future , i got the past
i got the class ring , she got the diamond and wedding band
i got the boy , and she got the man
yeah there's an old you that i knew
fake ids to get into those spring break bars
backwoods on a four wheel , hanging on tight
i can still feel my racing heart
and now you're cleaned up with a hair cut , nice tie and shoes
if things were different and i had a choice , which would i choose ?
i got the first kiss and she'll get the last
she's got the future , i got the past
i got the class ring , she got the diamond and wedding ban
i got the boy , and she got the man
i got the first kiss and sheâ€™ll get the last
we each got something , the other will never have
i got the long hair , hot head
she got the cool and steady hand
i got the boy and she got the man
i got the boy and she got the man
