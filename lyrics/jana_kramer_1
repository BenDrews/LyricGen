just the thought of you around
gets my head spinning , in circles
just the way you say my name
gets my heart turning , in circles
you got me spinning like a wheel
oh how you make me feel
it's more than gold on my finger
it's six feet down and forever
cause where i am
is where you begin
you picked up the pieces
and put me together
you're the only part of me unbroken
and i'm going , in circles
every crooked little lie
bended , connected , circles
every star up in the sky
every hello and goodbye
every moment by your side
is the meaning of my life
you got me spinning like a wheel
oh how you make me feel
it's more than gold on my finger
it's six feet down and forever
cause where i am
is where you begin
you picked up the pieces
and put me together
you're the only part of me unbroken
and i'm going , in circles
in circles
just the thought of you around
gets my head spinning , in circles
just the way you say my name
gets my heart turning , turning , turning
around and 'round again
you got me spinning like a wheel
oh how you make me feel
it's more than gold on my finger
it's six feet down and forever
cause where i am
is where you begin
you picked up the pieces
and put me together
you're the only part of me unbroken
and i'm going , in circles
in circles
just the thought of you around
gets my head spinning , in circles
