this will be the last song
about all the shit that went wrong
you burned me , i burned you
yeah all of it's true
i’m sick of that same ol’ tune
this is the last song
i’m ever gonna sing about you
the last time i write i can't live without you
come on melody , set me free
i have to move on
yeah you’re gone
so this is the last song
this will be the last verse
about all the pain and the hurt
of slippin' that ring off my finger
knowing you wouldn’t fight
you wouldn’t try , you wouldn’t try so
this is the last song
i’m ever gonna sing about you
the last time i write i can't live without you
come on melody , set me free
i have to move on
yeah you’re gone
so this is the last song
if you really think this is what
i really wanted then you’re just wrong
but you’re the one telling everyone
you were already gone
so here is the last song
i’m ever gonna sing about you
the last time
i write i can't live without you
come on melody , set me free
i have to move on
yeah you’re gone
so this is the last song
this is the last song
