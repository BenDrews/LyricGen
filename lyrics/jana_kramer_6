maybe you’re forgetting that you’re the one who called it quits
save your story , i already know the end
well i shoulda known that you’d come crawling back
it’s the only thing to do when you lose the best thing you ever had
i ain't your boomerang
i ain't the kinda thing that you can throw away
and watch it circle back around
don’t know what game you’re playing
begging me to stay when you send me on my way
now you’re finding out i’m an arrow straight into the sun
buckshot from a goodbye gun
a road that only runs one way
anything but a boomerang
now you’re second guessing , what do you expect from me ?
pick up where we left off , go back to what we used to
you can look me in the eyes and keep apologizing but i oh i
i ain't your boomerang
i ain't the kinda thing that you can throw away
and watch it circle back around
don’t know what game you’re playing
begging me to stay when you send me on my way
now you’re finding out i’m an arrow straight into the sun
buckshot from a goodbye gun
a road that only runs one way
anything but a boomerang
i’m a train burning down the tracks
i’m a phoenix rising from the ashes
gone baby , gone baby , gone
there’s nothing left , there’s nothing left to say
i ain't your boomerang
i ain't the kinda thing that you can throw away
and watch it circle back around
don’t know what game you’re playing
begging me to stay when you send me on my way
now you’re finding out i’m an arrow straight into the sun
buckshot from a goodbye gun
a road that only runs one way
anything but a boomerang
i’m anything but a boomerang
anything but a boomerang
i’m anything but a boomerang
anything but a boomerang
