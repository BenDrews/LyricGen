i still believe in fairy tales
i still believe in picking flowers
i still believe in getting lost in someone’s eyes
and talking for hours
i still believe in shooting stars
i still believe in midnight drives
and butterflies you get
right before you kiss for the very first time
love , how many times can a heart break ?
love , how much weight can a soul take ?
love , i don’t know where you ran off to
but love , love , love , i still believe in you
i still believe in miracles
i still believe in wedding rings and bibles
i still believe the best walk you’ll ever take
is walking down the aisle
i still believe that you’ll come knocking on my door
when i least expect you to
you give me something i can hold
you pull me through , cause that’s what you do
that’s what you do love
yeah , that’s what you do love
