bullet !
had the song picked out , had the preacher on call
had my mama in tears , she didn't like him at all
but i loved him , yeah i really thought i loved him
thank god i dodged a bullet
thank god i didn't do it
no empty shells on the ground and you're nowhere to be found
cause once the trigger is pulled , it's impossible to dodge a bullet
no more dragging your dark horse around on a chain
no more knock down , shouting , driving me insane
yeah i really thought i loved him
now i'm never thinking of him
thank god i dodged a bullet
thank god i didn't do it
no empty shells on the ground and you're nowhere to be found
cause once the trigger is pulled , it's impossible to dodge a bullet
close call , almost got shot down
thank you for showing me what i don't want
i dodged a bullet
thank god i dodged a bullet
thank god i didn't do it
no empty shells on the ground and you're nowhere to be found
i dodged a bullet
thank god i dodged a bullet
thank god i didn't do it
no empty shells on the ground and you're nowhere to be found
cause once the trigger is pulled , it's impossible to dodge a bullet
had the song picked out , had the preacher on call
huh
