everybody down in houston calls him " texas "
everybody way up north calls him " cornbread "
you shoulda heard the way that his momma called him " baby "
daddy called him " boy " , his friends call him " crazy "
shoulda just called it like i saw it
shoulda just called for help and ran like hell that day
the burn and the sting , and the high , and the heat
and the left - me - wanting - more feeling when he kissed me
i shoulda just called him " whiskey "
warm my body to the core just like a blanket
his face was so sweet then he took my breath away
hit me so hard like a rock through a window
i knew i was in trouble from the moment i met you , boy
now the numb has set in
he's gone like the wind
and i can barely feel the pain
