hot damn it , your booty like two planets
go ahead , and go ham sandwich
woah i can't stand it
cause you know what to do with that big fat butt
wiggle wiggle wiggle
wiggle wiggle wiggle
wiggle wiggle wiggle
just a little bit

tired of working that nine to five

hot damn it , your booty like two planets
go ahead , and go ham sandwich

( little bit , little bit , little bit )
shake what your mamma gave you , misbehave you
i just wanna strip you , dip you , flip you , bubble bathe you
what they do
taste my raindrops , k boo ?
now what you're willing , what you wanting , what you may do
completely separated til i deeply penetrate it
then i take it out and wipe it off
eat it , ate it , love it , hate it
overstated , underrated , everywhere i been
can you wiggle wiggle for the d - o - double g again ?
come on baby , turn around
you're a star , girl , take a bow
it's just one thing that's killing me
how do you fit that in them jeans ?
you know what to do with that big fat butt
wiggle wiggle wiggle

just a little bit
wiggle wiggle wiggle
