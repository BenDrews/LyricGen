derulo
it's too hard to sleep
i got the sheets on the floor , nothing on me
and i can't take it no more , it's a hundred degrees
i got one foot out the door , where are my keys ?
cause i gotta leave
in the back of the cab
i tipped the driver 'head of time , get me there fast
i got your body on my mind , i want it bad
oh just the thought of you gets me so high
so high
girl you're the one i want to want me
and if you want me , girl you got me
there's nothing i , no , i wouldn't do ( i wouldn't do )
just to get up next to you
girl you're the one i want to want me
and if you want me , girl you got me
there's nothing i , no , i wouldn't do ( i wouldn't do )
just to get up next to you
you open the door
wearing nothing but a smile down to the floor
and you whisper in my ear , " baby i'm yours "
ooh just the thought of you gets me so high
so high
girl you're the one i want to want me
and if you want me , girl you got me
there's nothing i , no , i wouldn't do ( i wouldn't do )
just to get up next to you
girl , you're the one i want to want me
and if you want me , girl you got me
there's nothing i , no , i wouldn't do ( i wouldn't do )
just to get up next to you
just the thought of you
gets me so high , so high
just the thought of you
gets me so high , so high
girl you're the one i want to want me
and if you want me , girl you got me
there's nothing i , no , i wouldn't do ( i wouldn't do )
just to get up next to you
girl you're the one i want to want me
and if you want me , girl you got me
there's nothing i , no , i wouldn't do ( i wouldn't do )
just to get up next to you
