a hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
when i think of all the years i want to be with you
wake up every morning with you in my bed
that's precisely what i plan to do
and you know one of these days when i get my money right
buy you everything and show you all of the finer things in life
we'll forever be in love so there ain't no need to rush
but one day i won't be able to ask you loud enough
i'll say will you marry me
i swear that i will mean it
i'll say will you marry me
how many girls in the world could make me feel like this ?
baby i don't ever plan to find out
the more i look , the more i find the reasons why
you're the love of my life
and you know one of these days when i get my money right
buy you everything and show you all of the finer things in life
we'll forever be in love so there ain't no need to rush
but one day i won't be able to ask you loud enough
i'll say will you marry me
i swear that i will mean it
i'll say will you marry me
and if i lost everything
in my heart it means nothing
cause i have you , girl i have you
to get right down on bended knee
nothing else would ever be better , better
the day when
i'll say will you marry me
i swear that i will mean it
i'll say will you marry me ( yeah )
i'll say will you marry me ( the day i get on my knees )
i swear that i will mean it
i'll say will you marry me ( what you do to me baby )
got me singing ( ooh )
got me singing ( ooh )
would you marry me baby ( ooh )
a hundred and five is the number that comes to my head
when i think of all the years i want to be with you
wake up every morning with you in my bed
that's precisely what i plan to do
