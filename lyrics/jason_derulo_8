in the beginning , i never thought it would be you
when we were chilling , smiling in the photo booth
but we got closer , ‘till you were eating off my spoon
you're coming over , and we would talk all afternoon
tonight we’ll just get drunk , disturb the peace
bind your hands all over me
and then you bite your lip , whisper and say
“we’re going all the way”
tonight , take me to the other side
sparks fly like the 4th of july
just take me to the other side
i see that sexy look in your eyes
and i know we ain’t friends anymore
if we walk down this road , we’ll be lovers for sure
so tonight , kiss me like it’s do or die
and take me to the other side
this could be perfect , but we won’t know unless we try
i know you’re nervous , so just sit back and let me drive
tonight we’ll just get drunk , disturb the peace
bind your hands all over me
and then you bite your lip , whisper and say
“we’re going all the way”
tonight , take me to the other side
sparks fly like the 4th of july
just take me to the other side
i see that sexy look in your eyes
and i know we ain’t friends anymore
if we walk down this road , we’ll be lovers for sure
so tonight , kiss me like it’s do or die
and take me to the other side
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
( oh oh oh oh oh oh oh )
kiss me like it's do or die
( oh oh oh oh oh oh oh )
and take me to the other side
tonight we’ll just get drunk , disturb the peace
bind your hands all over me
and then you bite your lip , whisper and say
“we’re going all the way”
tonight , take me to the other side
sparks fly like the 4th of july
just take me to the other side
i see that sexy look in your eyes
and i know we ain’t friends anymore
if we walk down this road , we’ll be lovers for sure
so tonight , kiss me like it’s do or die
and take me to the other side
