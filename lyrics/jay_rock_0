big money , big booty bitches
man , that shit gon' be death of me
big problems , i must admit it
man , that shit gon' be death of me
i pray to a c - note , my mama gave up hope
i can't stand myself
i just bought a new coat , i might go broke
i can't stand myself
big money , big booty bitches
man , that shit...
turn me up
sin city , sin city
sin city , sin city
big money , big booty bitches
tell the truth , nigga , i'm lost without it
7 figures for a headline
you want some stage time , we can talk about it
niggas actin' like they be rappin'
like nice on the mic , truly doubt it
go against the kid , y'all don't wanna live
that decision is hella childish
rose gold for my old hoes
they ain't satisfied then i sit 'em down
10th grade , i gave her all shade
but now she got some ass , i wan' hit it now
i don't lease , i just all out feast
i put a blue caprice on gary coleman
bomb head and some cheese eggs
that's a new raise and a signing bonus
fall in this bitch
like some good pussy , can't stand myself
so good , she so hood
she a cheesehead , patty melt
ged with some ebts , and some dvds
that shit was happening
she reel me in with some chicken wings
and some collard greens , that shit was brackin'
just cracked me a new bitch
bust a new nut on her nigga's jersey
my bitch get off at 9 o'clock
so i had to shake her 'round 7 : 30
105 , i'm stomping fast
with these big guns , i'm hella dirty
get caught with this shit
i ain't comin' home 'til like 2030
i got big money , big booty bitches
man , that shit gon' be death of me ( death of me )
big problems , i must admit it
man , that shit gon' be death of me ( death of me )
big dreams , no superstition
man , that shit gon' be death of me ( death of me )
i pray to a c - note , my mama gave up hope
i can't stand myself
i just bought a new coat , i might go broke
i can't stand myself
i just might ban myself
i just might... god !
i'm focused feeling blessed
cause my eyes be the truth
i'm focused feeling blessed
cause my eyes be the truth
mental window blurry as a bitch
still lookin' out it
so much money off the fuckin' books
could write a book about it
took a minute , no , wait a minute
let me think about it
bout ten years , crips , bloods
sweat and tears , and we still counting
had a real thick bitch named brooklyn
she fucked the whole squad
now every time i land in brooklyn
they fuck with the whole squad
i'm more spiritual than lyrical
i'm similar to eli , why ?
cause i'm wearin' black shades
and i'm headed west with the word of god ( amen )
i think i'm finally ready to talk about it
these niggas just talk about it
homie you don't play me for no fool
poppin' bottles like enemigos
ay dios mio , i'm so cold
get so deep in that water , water
they should call my johnson a harpoon
feed the needy , don't know graffiti
paint her walls like a cartoon
beat the pussy up so bad
send her home with some war wounds
loaded off the 'gnac , hit her from the back
goin' 'cross her head , bar stool
touch her soul , 'til i curl her toes
then it's time to reload , then it's part two
damn near 30 , still set trippin' cuz
where you're from , i'ma see about it
last year i made ten million
that's where i've been , yeah , a private island
smoking something , on autopilot
got too many cars , i might crash a whip
new 'rari pedal barely tapping
nigga , vroom - vroom , yeah , i'm rich , bitch
got two rollies , but one missing
think my daughter flossing , she in kindergarten
got one crib worth two cribs
and my front lawn , yeah , that's water fountain
you be talking boss , saying big words
like philosophies , man , you weird homie
what it sounds to me that you broke as fuck
and your bitch gon' leave , and that's real , homie
a dashiki on , with a fedora on
and my round glasses , tryna fool the cops
i'm with you dot , on that sneak dissing
when you penny bitchin' , nigga , shoot the fade
ugly nigga , but i'm fine as wine
did you check your time ? i get good with age
shoot the nine , like fourth grade
black hippy droppin' , eyebrows raised
i'm focused feeling blessed
cause my eyes be the truth
i'm focused feeling blessed
cause my eyes be the truth
i got big money , big booty bitches
man , that shit gon' be death of me ( death of me )
big problems , i must admit it
man , that shit gon' be death of me ( death of me )
big dreams , no superstition
that shit gon' be the death of me ( death of me )
i pray to a c - note , my mama gave up hope
i can't stand myself
i just bought a new coat , i just might go broke
i can't stand myself
i just might damn myself
i just might... god ! ... god !
