ain't no game , i'm takin' all you have
and you're gonna pay for it
i don't know if i can stop myself
and you're gonna pay for it
oh , you'll never learn
i touch fire , little burn
this ain't no game , i'm takin' all you have
and you're gonna pay for it
it's a heavy load , i stroll on a bumpy road
no jacket when i was cold , becomin' one with my soul
stand toe to toe with my foes , these wolves in sheep clothes
no weapon on me shall prosper , nigga , you better watch it
you playin' with fire , burnin' you slow , hold up
i hear the whispers wishin' , it's all cheap voodoo
i keep it cool to keep from goin' coo - coo
with a cal , aimin' at fake smiles and turn them upside down
came too far for my feet to fail me
lord , if i'm wrong you can help me now , hold up
wait a minute , what am i sayin' ?
the devil , he busy , tryna get me everyday in every way
i won't let up , i won't shut up
you can't stop me , you won't knock me , ten - four , now copy
live almighty , my declaration been written
in hieroglyphics on top of the highest mountain , now listen
ain't no game , i'm takin' all you have
and you're gonna pay for it
i don't know if i can stop myself
and you're gonna pay for it
i tell 'em all to hail king kendrick , resurrectin' my vengeance
been dissectin' your motormouth , 'til i break down the engine
this ain't no warnin' shot , this a relevant henchman
see my opponent , then *smooch* cease your existence
endin' our friendship , baby , i'd rather die alone
your diaphragm is dietary , what you eatin' on ?
capture your audience with these words , boy
the holy chapel , the tabernacle , the book of matthew
and jesus starin' at you , take your turn , boy
see ? it's gon' take a whole lot of y'all to kill me
see ? it's gon' take a whole tribe of y'all to kill me , i never die
my pedigree apparently only to idolize
ahead of me is only my future and idle time
longevity , i gotta get used to makin' you mine
you tellin' me i only get used to livin' if fine
you can never live in my shoes , permanently paid from god
when the sun goes down , i scream loud , i'll sleep when i die
but i will never die , my legacy is alive
when the sun goes down , i scream loud , i'll sleep when i die
but i will never die , my legacy is alive
i gotta get it off my chest , push words just like weight
i got to eat 'til it shows on my face
tragedy turned to triumph , i'm tryin' just to relate
jumpin' off of them towers , i'm takin' that leap of faith
playin' at high stakes
now when i speak , their pupils'll dilate
their speakers'll vibrate
know you feelin' the vibe , that vine couldn't relate
this next clip is long , a son of a gun , big numbers
do the math , now cover the sum
i come from the slums , we come for the funds
like run it , under the sun where niggas livin' their life blunted
countin' the ones , but truthfully nothin' like hundreds
keep it one hundred
roadblock in front of me , look , i'm runnin' through it
stick and move it , sippin' that hennessy
this my gutter fluid , nothin' to it
what we lost , we gon' make it back
like it wasn't missin' , now listen , you 'bout to pay for that
oh , you'll never learn
i touch fire , little burn
this ain't no game , i'm takin' all you have
and you're gonna pay for it
