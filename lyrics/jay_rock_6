keep it one hundred , i’m one hundred and one
i ain’t talking dalmatians up under the sun
on the road to damascus , gun and a suit
you either coming with some products or you coming for loot
i’m coming with the peace so i’m chucking the deuce
i ain’t tryna run a train i’m just in the caboose
and i’m tryna give these niggas the truth
i ain’t ‘bout to spazz on ‘em , give ‘em light
i’m just doing my zeus
rubbing on her body just like a masseuse
and it’s money like a hobby for you to seduce
but if you blink twice nigga you can maduse
see the snakes in here , look there's hate in there
i pray that you niggas all playing fair
you can’t help but stare as you face the glare , yeah
i’m not up on in short yellow
with a helmet on my head while i’m eating marshmallows
playing jigsaw while i’m picking off devils
i can rock this shit on all levels
straight up out the es , journey over bs
i’m like a hundred kilos stuffed in the prius
i’m going hard ‘til they free us
hold up wait a minute
let me put some season in this gumbo
hold up wait a minute
let me put some season in this gumbo
whole lot of flavor , flavor
whole lot of flavor , flavor
whole lot of flavor , flavor
whole lot of flavor , for you
whole lot of flavor , flavor
whole lot of flavor , flavor
whole lot of flavor , flavor
whole lot of flavor , for you
have you ever put your hand over fire just to see what you could tolerate ?
and you can find no escape
life is a dominatrix waiting for shit to pollinate
to make you mind your mistakes
keeping my chin down , nose clean , with my guards up
charged up ‘cause this ghetto got me scarred up
yes , i’m the child with the crookedest smile
look at my foul , look at what the star bucks
you can’t swim if you don’t paddle
wake up in the morning with my nose to the gravel
bloodhound , for that federal reserve note
that’s when i noticed the switch niggas just turned coats
it's the way of the world , carry the weight of the world
carry a blade too , for they forsake you
yeah , i’m the vision , from the night i was born
to be the eye of the tiger in the eye of the storm
i own a clock , ain’t no need for alarms
just get on your a - game when it’s time to perform
yeah , and i can show you what it feels like
the moment they want you defeated but yet you still fight
so what it feel like ?
hold up wait a minute
let me put some season in this gumbo
hold up wait a minute
let me put some season in this gumbo
whole lot of flavor , flavor
whole lot of flavor , flavor
whole lot of flavor , flavor
whole lot of flavor , for you
whole lot of flavor , flavor
whole lot of flavor , flavor
whole lot of flavor , flavor
whole lot of flavor , for you
