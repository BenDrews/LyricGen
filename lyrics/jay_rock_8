take my mind on this road , you too
i took my mind on this road , way through
i take your mind on this road , you do
i took my mind on this road , way through
i don't know why niggas keep fucking with me
these streets make it so hard to breathe
highs and my lows
look both ways , where i'm supposed to go
ah , shit , get out my pocket
the stench from the smoker's smoke , so ferocious
winos in the alley , nearly slumped over
demons in they eyes , glassy , no folgers
wake up sober , kill you for a cold one
snotty nosed rascals , big ratchet toters
give it up slowly , click , clack , it's over
something like velcro , stay attached to corners
hood rats plotting , riding for the blue cheese
all for the gram , grams and a new weave
all they got is spandex pants , and some loose knees
niggas taking chances , tip - toeing with two p's
no one's exempt , weak or strong they do bleed
candle light vigils , closure if they do leave
bullets have a name defined by different calibers
concrete jungle , beware of different challengers
gotta have the stomach for dookie bags and catheters
play your cards right or be scratching off them calendars
i don't know why niggas keep fucking with me
these streets make it so hard to breathe
highs and my lows
look both ways , where i'm supposed to go
ah , shit , get out my pocket
these waters are murky , crocodiles they lurking
murder rate merging , up and down virgins
guess you gotta play street versions of a surgeon
keep beat bursting , closing down all your curtains
when shit don't go right , gotta question your purpose
denim with them serpents coming back to surface
ebt , zero balance , worthless
you either leave in limousines or them hearses
too much bad blood , another problem emerges
you started the problem you motherfucking deserved it
politicking , a lot of liquor , that be the answer
they marlboro , trying to trick them , they be the cancer
gotta get that loose change , you gotta kick a nigga brain
like your name liu kang , that be the mantra
stop , look , listen , that's the words to live by
know you gotta stake your claim , like a rib - eye
90059 , nigga , here's why
i don't know why niggas keep fucking with me
these streets make it so hard to breathe
highs and my lows
look both ways , where i'm supposed to go
ah , shit , get out my pocket
ah , shit , get out my pocket
ah , shit , get out my pocket
get out my pocket
a force from the rap game my nigga , this ain’t a circus
there’s no ringling brothers , no barnum and bailey
clowned ass niggas get marked out daily , trucked out lately
bitch niggas get they hat brought to them , you don’t communicate
well hands and the gat talk to you , what’s the convo ?
don’t think fast , you end up getting a combo
think situations is calm , then they bomb though
sleeping in the bando , it’s either death or jail
something you never planned for , dreaming about lambos
wake up shivering , pillow next to a lamppost
straight up out the motherfuckin’ crockpot it’s watts
one stops leave you with dope , socks is not boxed
no rats , re - rock that got them all losing weight
got all they teeth shot but got a sweet spot
gotta call up dr. dre just for the detox
all of this in one zip code , keep the streets hot
i don't know why niggas keep fucking with me
these streets make it so hard to breathe
highs and my lows
look both ways , where i'm supposed to go
ah , shit , get out my pocket
