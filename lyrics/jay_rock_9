i was on the block right , wasn't in my right mind
just a young nigga , hustling , trying to get mine
movin' with the 9 double m
niggas like , " you don't really wanna fuck with him "
yeah , young teenager , infatuated with paper
yeah i had to get it cause momma , she wasn't able
black and white tv set , no cable
40's in the fridge , chicken noodles on the table
i wasn't born with a silver spoon
child of the ghetto , raised off a different tune
watching bob barker in my living room
if the price was right , i could get you a whole living room
yeah , them was my gutter ways back in the gutter days
no education but the gutter pays , through it all , i came a long way
from selling the yay , fist fights to gun play , back then
sittin' on the block and i'm doing bad
dreaming about the things that i never had
got me thinking to myself i gotta get it man
you can play if you want , i'm gon' get it man
i say , all my life i've known one day eventually , i'll blow
yeah , times is hard as it is
that's why i got guns and my guns got kids
that's why i be going so tough on them hoes
i play my own hand , i don't shuffle or fold
fuck with a nigga , let go fuck with some hoes
hear them bitches screaming like they stuck in a hole
i am not a demon but was once a lost soul
till i found myself a block away from the cross road
i have , outgrown the fishbowl
and i'm on my feet like a fucking insole
yeah it may hurt like a fucking lymph node
but it's fuck the world like a fucking nympho
and we spend dough cause we make more and i make sure when i say so
it's jay rock and weezy , need i say more ?
clothesline the beat , ted dibiase flow , yeah
jay rock , still that same o.g
i ain't trying see the grave or the penitentary
everyday living , trying to stay on my feet
even though a nigga paid but my heart in the streets
see my dogs , i'm a beast , so hard on these beats
so my family can eat , i'll be damned if i see no income
here come jay rock , they know crack music , drug kingpin flow , oh
kingpin ho , need i say more ?
your family could die , when i say go - go
green light , green light , what ya green like ?
before ya sign me up , get the scene right
and i just hop in the phantom when i'm feelin nice
cause driving slow in the lam' , it doesn't seem right
yeah and i remember them long nights
living the wrong life but i made that wrong right , weezy
all the struggling , all it does is keep me hustling , oh my
