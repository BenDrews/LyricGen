you'd take the clothes off my back and i'd let you
you'd steal the food right out my mouth
and i'd watch you eat it
i still donâ€™t know why , why our love is so much , ohh
( thanks for warnin' me , thanks for warnin' me )
you curse my name in spite to put me to shame
hang my laundry in the streets , dirty or clean
give it up for fame
but i still don't know why , why i love it so much
( thanks for warnin' me , thanks for warnin' me )
and , baby , it's amazin' i'm in this maze with you
i just can't crack your code
one day you screamin' you love me loud
the next day you're so cold
one day you're here , one day you're there , one day you care
you're so unfair
sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
holy grail
blue told me remind you niggas
fuck that shit y'all talking 'bout , i'm the nigga
caught up in all these lights and cameras
but look what that shit did to hammer
goddamn it , i like it
bright lights is enticin' , but look what it did to tyson
all that money in one night , thirty mil' for one fight
but soon as all the money blows , all the pigeons take flight
fuck the fame , keep cheatin' on me
what i do ? i took her back
fool me twice ; that's my bad , i can't even blame her for that
enough to make me wanna murder
momma , please just get my bail
i know nobody to blame ; kurt cobain , i did it to myself
and we all just entertainers
and we're stupid and contagious
and we all just entertainers
and , baby , it's amazin' i'm in this maze with you
i just can't crack your code
one day you screamin' you love me loud
the next day you're so cold
one day you're here , one day you're there , one day you care
you're so unfair
sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
holy grail
now i got tattoos on my body
psycho bitches in my lobby
i got haters in the paper , photo shoots with paparazzi
can't even take my daughter for a walk
see 'em by the corner store
i feel like i'm cornered off
enough is enough , i'm callin' this off
who the fuck i'm kiddin' though ?
i'm gettin' high , sittin' low
slidin' by in that big body , curtains all in my window
this fame hurt , but this chain worse
i think back you asked the same person
if this is all you had to deal with
nigga , deal with , this shit ain't work
this light work , camera snappin' , my eyes hurt
niggas dying back where i was birthed
fuck your iris and the irs
get the hell up off your high horse
you got the shit that niggas die for , dry yours
why you mad ? take the good with the bad
or throw the baby out with that bath water
you still alive , still that nigga
nigga , you survived , you still gettin' bigger
nigga , living the life , vanilla wafers in a villa
illest nigga alive ; michael jackson's thriller
and , baby , it's amazin' i'm in this maze with you
i just can't crack your code
one day you screamin' you love me loud
the next day you're so cold
one day you're here , one day you're there , one day you care
you're so unfair
sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
holy grail
you get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
and you take the blade right out my heart
just so you can watch me bleed
and i still don't know why , why i love you so much , yeah
and you play this game in spite to drive me insane
i got it tattooed on my sleeve
forever in ink with guess whose name
but i still don't know why , why our love is so much
and , baby , it's amazin' i'm in this maze with you
i just can't crack your code
one day you screamin' you love me loud
the next day you're so cold
one day you're here , one day you're there , one day you care
you're so unfair
sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
holy grail
