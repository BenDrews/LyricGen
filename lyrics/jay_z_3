who wants that perfect love story anyway , anyway ?
cliché , cliché , cliché , cliché
who wants that hero love that saves the day , anyway ?
cliché , cliché , cliché , cliché
what about the bad guy goes good , yeah ?
an innocent love i'm misunderstood , yeah ?
black hour glass , our glass
toast to clichés in a dark past
toast to clichés in a dark past
boy meets girl , girl perfect woman
girl get to bustin' before the cops come running
chuck the deuces , chugging d'ussé , ugh
fuck what you say , boys in blue say
i don't care if we on the run
baby as long i'm next to you
( uhuu )
and if loving you is a crime
tell me why do i bring out the best in you
why
i hear sirens while we make love
loud as hell , but they don't know
they're nowhere near us
i will hold your heart and your gun
i don't care if they come , noooo
i know it's crazy but
they can take me
now that i found the places that you
take me
without you i got nothing to lose
i'm an outlaw , got an outlaw chick
bumping 2pac , on my outlaw shit
matching tats , this ink don't come off
even if rings come off , if things ring off
my nails get dirty , my past ain't pretty
my lady is , my mercedes is
my baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas
keep it 100 , hit the lottery niggas
you ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me , nigga
you know it's till the death , i hope it's obvi to niggas
ugh
cross the line , speak about mine
i'mma wave this tec , i'm a geek about mine
touch a nigga where his rib at , i click clack
push your mothafuckin' wig back , i did that
i been wilding since a juvi , she was a good girl
'til she knew me , now she is in the drop bustin' uey's , screaming
they can take me
now that i found the places that you
take me
without you i got nothing to lose
deeper than words , beyond right
die for your love , beyond life
sweet as a jesus piece , beyond ice
blind me baby with your neon lights
ray bans on , police in sight
oh , what a beautiful death , let's both wear white
if you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
just sneak out and meet me , bring a box of l's
she fell in love with the bad guy , the bad guy
what you doing with them rap guys , them rap guys
they ain't see potential in me girl , but you see it
if it's me and you against the world , then so be it
i don't care if they give me life
i get all of my life from you
( uhuu )
and if loving you had a price
i would pay my life for you
i hear sirens while we make love
loud as hell , but they don't know
they're nowhere near us
i will hold your heart and your gun
i don't care if they come , noooo
i know it's crazy but
i don't care i'll never give it up
give it up , give it up , give it all away
no i swear i'll never give it up
give it up , give it up , give it all away
i don't care i'll never give it up
give it up , give it up , give it all away
no i swear i'll never give it up
give it up , give it up , give it all away
( without you i got nothing to lose )
