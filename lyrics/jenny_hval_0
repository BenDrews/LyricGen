what is it to take care of yourself ? what are we taking care of ? a million bedrooms with hands softly lulling our divine cocks and cunts , without telling anyone , a million ships come alone out on the calmest seas. so are we loving ourselves now ? are we mothering ourselves ?
statistics and newspapers tell me i am unhappy and dying , that i need man and child to fulfill me , that i'm more likely to get breast cancer. and it's biology , it's my own fault , it's divine punishment of the unruly. it's fearfull out here on the calmest seas , we who grew up singing merry christmas ! war is over. our mothers softly humming : we're at the end of history
but i keep growing older , eight years since 25 now , and all that ages now is the body , i wonder why , i think to myself one of these days everything i write begins with the question , what's wrong with me ?
you say i'm free now , that battle is over , and feminism is over & socialism's over. yeah , i say i can consume what i want now
this is what happens on the edge of history : the great eye turns to us. we are the only thing that's aging , but we don't know it yet , we cling onto heaven , heaven , heaven
sleep tight forever
sleep tight forever
