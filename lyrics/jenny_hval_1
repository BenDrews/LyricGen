and sometimes i dream you've left me
and i'm so lost i wake up high
high on madness
a sexual holding pattern
stuck in erotic self - oscillation
this landmine of a heart
the only one i've ever had
i've ever had
conceptual romance is on my mind
i call it abstract romanticism
conceptual romance is you
it's you and i
it's you and i
this blood bitch's tale
it goes a bit like this :
i lose myself in the rituals of bad art , in failure
i want to give up but i can tell
my heartbreak is too sentimental for you
conceptual romance is on my mind
i call it abstract romanticism
conceptual romance is you
it's you and i
it's you and i
so i lose my gaze to keep you
creating a curve for the eyes
a rejected body
and losing it is constant , but such a lonely place
what can i say ?
i don't know who i am , but
i'm working on it
i'm working on it
i'm working on it
i'm working on it
i'm working on it
i'm high , high on madness
these are my combined failures
i understand infatuation , rejection
they can connect and become everything
everything that's torn up in your life
but come with me , i want to show you something
the original wound , the origin of the world
of the world
of the world
( i'm working on it )
( i'm working on it )
of the world
