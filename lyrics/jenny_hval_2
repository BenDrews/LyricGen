like capitalism
it works like unrequited love that way
it never rests
just like i need the love i'm not getting from you
and all the people in the world
are between you and i in that way
and in the way of love
you must be disgusted
but i need to keep writing because everything else is death
i'm self - sufficient , mad , endlessly producing
i don't need money , i just need your love
or your approval , anything
like capitalism
it works like unrequited love that way
it never rests
just like i need the love i'm not getting from you
and all the people in the world
are between you and i in that way
and in the way of love
any sign is a promise of love , of being exposed
a staged ritual undressing taking a place of consumation
i'm here writing , working , making myself
available for love
making myself available for love
because i love you
because i love you
because i love you
i just need a sign
any recognition is a reward
because i love you
