what is it to take care of yourself ? getting paid ? getting laid ? getting married ? getting pregnant ? fighting for visibility in your market ? realizing your potential ? being healthy , being clean , not making a fool of yourself , not hurting yourself ? shaving in all the right places
what am i taking care of ? i'm lying in our bed unable to sleep , reaching a state of absolute dependence. in a restless half - dream , like the jam without a spoon , and i grab my cunt with my hand that isn't clean. am i loving myself now ? am i mothering myself ? am i taking care of myself now ?
i imagine you're doing the same , holding onto your soft dick. it lies in the hand where it dares stay soft. could i be that for you ? that cupping hand on your soft dick ? could i give you that , that which sometimes expects nothing ? accepting restlessness , accepting no direction , accepting this fearful wanting that isn't desire ?
that going nowhere ? a warm place. can we go there ? we don't have to fuck , can we just lie here being ? i give you this hand. i give you this hand
