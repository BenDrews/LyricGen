transient , restless
i'm not there , or not there yet
but if i'm coming i must be hollow enough
i follow the body , i mustn't rest
when i'm near you become someone else
i'm so tired of subjectivity
i must justify my presence by losing it
must not keep a steady gaze
keep a steady gaze
when i'm near you become someone else
here it comes , here it comes
here it comes
a strange slow rhythm , not exactly creating a rhythm
here it comes
in and out of focus , vulnerable , the original crevasse
in a moment of confusion i don't know what to say
and i hear myself ask :
where does it hurt to create curves for the gaze ?
the body as a subconscious
and desire takes place somewhere , everywhere
here it comes
here it comes
here it comes ( in the dampness of )
here it comes ( winter air between us )
here it comes ( in the restlessness of hotel rooms )
here it comes ( the smell of spanish wetlands )
here it comes
in the way you say :
it hurts everywhere
