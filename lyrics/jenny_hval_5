i'm six or seven and dreaming that i'm a boy. i emerged out of the water and went into the garden with a small silver hand between my thighs
later , in the shower , i see a boy naked. he is contagious , and i can feel mine. i was told not to stare then , but my eyes have never been larger , in & out of my body , my stare kept growing , iii - iiii - iii - iii - ii - i - iii - i - i - i - i guess that's what's called flesh memory. oh , how i wanted to tell him that we had switched places ! in my dream i'd had him on me , but i didn't that day when i told her the dog was a wolf and the rock was a cliff , and you're a horse ! i said , if the dog was a wolf and i a boy she could be a horse , sure thing , she had no excuse
and we were running then , horse and wolf and girl , braces on her teeth like a bridle , a bride , a bridle. i felt tight against supple , cool against hot , wires and skin. i've always been like this
some days i feel like my body is straightened , held up by thin braces , metal spikes embrace my spine , my face , my cunt. i can feel myself from above , but i can't see who's holding them. it would be easy to think about submission , but i don't think it's about submission , it's about holding and being held
we ran willingly , horse - like , girl - like , boy - like. her voice neighing in the back of her throat , and when i came closer we collided and kissed in the passing , on the mouth , like horses do. i said , her thin lips over enamel and steel. i felt the outline of her braces against my own , little silver arms reaching for each other
