think big , girl , like a king , think kingsize. did you learn nothing in america ? i've placed four big bananas in my lap
in new york i don't dream. i always wanted to be less subculturally lonely , but here i see no subculture. no , no future. no big science. no big bananas. but i found no , no future
i rock the bananas gently , move back and forth. don't wake them
what is soft dick rock ? using the elements of dick to create a softer , toned - down sound. i sing to the bananas. the skin is getting thin and brown
norway. the girls are pretty. i'm one fourth danish. if you have a child you better learn how to bake. i beckon the cupcake , the huge capitalist clit. i search the oven , scrub the racks , put my whole head inside , but i just can't find it. it's like looking out the window in there
the bananas rot slowly in my lap , silently , wildly , girly. the rash is an opportunity , a common disease , something in common , a community , the definition must be : something attacking itself
four flaking , flaccid fingers. no future. oh , the fruit flies
