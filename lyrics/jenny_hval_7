failed every period
did baroque badly
afraid of blood
dream was too lonely
i chose keeping it together
in these ikea white walls
of my post - war nordic silence
but only desire is real
i must find some kind of art form
where i can call my tongue back from the underground
( back from the underground )
back from the underground
there are multitudes
there are multitudes
in the doctor's office my speculum pulls me open
spacing the space
accidental sci - fi
regulating my aperture , vagine savant
some people find it painful
but all i feel is connected
all i feel is connected
there must be some kind of art form
where i can call my blood
there are multitudes
there are multitudes
there are multitudes
don't be afraid
it's only blood
