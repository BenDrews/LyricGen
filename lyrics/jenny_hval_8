it sums up the strange mood of our time when nothing really makes any coherent sense. we live with a constant vaudeville of contradictory stories that makes it impossible for any real opposition to emerge , because they can't counter it with a coherent narrative of their own. and it means that we as individuals become ever more powerless , unable to challenge anything because we live in a state of confusion and uncertainty
i'm in a big house , having big dreams
the next time i wake up there's blood on the bed
didn't know it was time yet
or is it not mine ?
i feel old in this hotel
as if surprised to find i still have it in me
and yet so young
hollow
unsure if from young or old
i dip my finger in it
smells like warm winter
then i feel the need to touch everything
everything in this room
like a dog i'm marking everything that belongs to no - one
bringing it close to me , or life , or something
i have big dreams
and blood powers
my own art history
my combined failures
