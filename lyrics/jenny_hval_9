o , heaven , o , heaven , the next queens - bound train is two stations away. from tvedestrand , my white gown that curls around the harbour fetal - style. i never was a girly girl , forgive me !
from the very back of the church choir i am standing , lone alto range. girl in black. the front row clasp their hands now , they're singing with devotion. i separate from feeling , complex harmonic motion. i shut my mouth and ran away , spot out that neoliberal , girly heart that held no blood and made no beat , just vibrated sweetly in the chest. but i'm 33 now , that's jesus - age , and girl spaces come back to me. i want to sing religiously , you know , airy , more than necessary , climbing the ladders just to fall , uncontrollably to heaven. o , heaven , i'm standing in a graveyard of girls. o tvedestrand , o , white gown , the tombstones are so tall and hard , i want to sit on them , put death inside my body , i want
so much death inside my body ! heaven , i'm sorry. i just want to feel
so much death , a hole to nowhere
