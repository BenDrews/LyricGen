ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh..
i think about all the time
think you may need all of mine
hate to say you know that love is blind
i'm 'bout to see , i'll close my eyes
( truth is ) they can't see you in here though
most of them need dollar signs to make
every day your birthday
and every night your valentine…
if we
tried that we could be
somewhere in the climate
is warm , long as you around me
i swear that everything will be just fine
i wish that we could take some time
go anywhere , baby i don’t mind
grown man , in my suit and tie
hey , there's no we without you and i
oh , yea , ah yea , ah ah yea
hey , there's no we without you and i
oh yea , ah yea , ah ah yea
hey , there's no we without you and i
see my baby know
where my baby go , i go
it's no better feeling , you know
when i’m next to her for sure
it's like you on my mind all day
get this off my chest
ah damn , i know i love you
i swear your shit the best
friends , they know they hate
get that off my chest
ah yeah , i think i love you
oh baby , maybe...
