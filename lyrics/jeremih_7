and i just don't want you to leavin'

and i know there's no replacing what we had going on for so long
but when it hurts , i can make it better

our problems and the pain ( pain ) , but love don't change , ooh ooh

and you still make me know that you need me
and i know sometimes you don't believe me
but you stay on my mind , so believe me
