chiti - chiti - bang - bang
don chi chi ( that's me )
rollin wit'cha nigga nate d
you know these niggas straight bang
big game d - ballin with the 21st street
chiti - chiti - bang - bang
don chi chi ( that's me )
still makin tight - ass beats
i'm rollin in my brome , i stay sweet
ain't nobody ballin like me
it goes , mirror mirror on the wall
who's the biggest baller of all
i got a 700 , a bentley , and a magine
the girls just die when i'm ridin past
live life like i'm sellin pies
ah - rabian , with two or three wives
two or three houses to hide
ten cars that's parked outside
and they all got bodies that's wide , follow me
as the leer jet flies , over crimson tides
four bedroom duplex in the sky
nicknamed lottery , cuz i don't stop spendin
when the wheels stop , the chrome keep spinnin
like the six moon - walkin , shit i ain't talkin
i'm straight livin it , it's a wonder i ain't shiverin
i'm so frozen and you've been chosen
to roll with me and nate d - o double g , sing
it's five o'clock in the mo'nin
i've already downed five , i've already downed five mo's
see ya around my block on the weekend
all we do is chase bad , all we do is chase bad hoes
pass me the weed if it's chronic
if not then i just say no , then i just say no
three girls a date , that's my limit
we ballin outta control , we ballin outta control - ol
now whether you like me or not , whenever i drop
you know i give you number one hits platinum hot
it's so much clarity in my rocks , i'm thinkin like
it's gotta be somebody greater , maybe it's not
cuz i flow for those , that get that dough
hits for every chick with a size c tits
see it's like this , i don't mind wavin at you kids
but i can't manage to raise my wrist
jewels so heavy , y'all fools ain't ready
my twenty - two shot the streets into confetti
move like andretti , redlinin
whatever city i'm in , headlinin
at five a.m. i'm still lookin for mo'
still gettin crunk , still lettin it flow
bar outta cris' now i'm drinkin mo'
stomach upset , i feel like i'm about to let it go
it's five o'clock in the mo'nin
got my pedal to the flo' , got my pedal to the flo'
it's time i test my 600
wonder how fast this bitch go , wonder how fast this bitch go
three girls and two of 'em sleepin
one got her hands on my balls , one got her hands on my balls
sun's comin up , we still drinkin
we ballin outta control , really ballin outta control - ol
dance , everybody
and everbody just clap ya hands
lemme see y'all dance , everybody
everybody just clap ya hands
lemme see y'all dance , everybody
and everybody just clap ya hands
lemme see y'all dance , everybody
everybody just clap ya hands
