wake up , wake up
gotta get this paper , get this cake up
gotta do my hair , gotta put on makeup
gotta act like i care about this fake stuff
straight up what a waste of my day
if i had it my way i'd roll out of bed
say bout 2 : 30 mid day
hit the blunt then , hit you up to come over to my place
you show up right away
we make love and then we fuck
and then you'd give me my space
yeah
what i am trying to say is
that love is ours to make so we should make it
everything else can wait
the time is ours to take so we should take it
wake up , wake up , bake up
gotta heat the vape up
lets get faded
gotta call your job tell em' you won't make it
ain't nobody here baby lets get wasted
we should just get naked
cause i be working hard and i know you be on that same shit
every other day's a different game that you just can't win
i just want to ease your mind and make you feel all right
so go head tell your baby mama you gon be with me tonight
right
what i am trying to say is
( what i am trying to say is )
that love is ours to make so we should make it
( we should make it , we should make it )
everything else can wait
( everything else can wait )
the time is ours to take so we should take it
it's not love , but it's pretty close
hot fudge and a little smoke
i didn't mean it means nothing to you
hands locked on my black couch with nothing to do
can't stop on cloud 20
buried in the drugs , but the feels keeps coming
finally stop crying , but your nose is still running
wipe it on my shirt , ( haha , on my sleeve )
you tell me that you wanna do it big
i love it when you say " guess what ? " ( what ? what ? )
reading stories to some other nigga kid
and i wonder why i'm all messed up ( up up up up )
cause we gotta be responsible sometimes
being a class act nevermind my alumni
i don't wanna be around a baby so dumb high
that i don't see the beauty of a momma on insides
curled up with my head on your chest
it's the best remedy for the pain and the stress
if the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed
it will be like this to the kiss of the death
of my soul , bowl of the blue dream , no
not a good team , once soul , two halves
no joke , who laughs ?
just us ( just us , just us )
okay , got this oj and jose
mixed it up with that rose
we gon' do this our own way
alright , okay
what is it that you're smoking ?
piece it up with this peace and love
and this peace and love like the old days
what i am trying to say is
( what i am trying to say is )
that love is ours to make so we should make it
( we should make it , we should make it )
everything else can wait
( everything else can wait )
the time is ours to take so we should take it
we should stay right here
we should lay right here
cause everything is okay right here
you should stay right here
we should lay right here
cause everything is okay right here
