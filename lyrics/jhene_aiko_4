wake up , wake up
gotta get this paper , get this cake up
gotta do my hair , gotta put on makeup
gotta act like i care about this fake stuff
straight up what a waste of my day
if i had it my way i'd roll out of bed
say bout 2 : 30 mid day
hit the blunt then , hit you up to come over to my place
you show up right away
we make love then and then we fuck
and then you'd give me my space
yeah
what i am trying to say is
that love is ours to make so we should make it
everything else can wait
the time is ours to take so we should take it
wake up , wake up , bake up
gotta heat the vape up
lets get faded
gotta call your job tell em' you won't make it
ain't nobody here baby lets get wasted
we should just get naked
cause i be working hard and i know you be on that same shit
every other day's a different game that you just can't win
i just want to ease your mind and make everything all right
so go head tell your baby mama you gon be with me tonight
right
what i am trying to say is
the love is our to make so we should make it
everything else can wait
the time is ours to take so we should take it
