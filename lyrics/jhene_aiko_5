out of place , out of space and time , wide awake
out of papers i am , not okay
i am out my mind
outer space , that’s where i been goin'
to a place where , place where nobody knows
floating at a pace where now you see me now and now you don’t
i do not feel the fear of fallin , i wanna fly
if it all goes well then i will
but what if i don’t ?
ill be right where i was before
but i’m not alone , you say take my hand
and we go ( and we go ) , and we go ( and we go )
and i hope that we don’t overdose
cause we don’t ( cause we don’t )
no we don’t ( no we don't )
ever know when we have had enough
wait...
now my thoughts so cloudy and my hearts so crowded with hate
i am so frustrated like my souls been taken away
broken promise of everything that i thought you were
thought you said this would never hurt , that’s what it did that is all
i do not feel the fear of falling
thought i could fly
it didn’t go well but oh well
what do you know
i’m right back where i was before
but i’m not alone , you say take my hand
and we go ( and we go ) , and we go ( and we go )
and i hope that we don’t overdose
cause we don’t ( cause we don’t )
no we don’t ( no we don't )
ever know when we have had enough
i'm a be so cold , need some more
i’ve never felt these things before
i’m a feind for sure , please don't go
how could you not need me no more ?
you're the only thing that i love
you’re the only thing that i want
you’re the only reason , the only reason
i do not feel the fear of fallin' , i wanna fly
if it all goes well , then i will
but what if i don’t ?
ill be right where i was before
but i’m not alone
you're all that i know
