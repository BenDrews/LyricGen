change is inevitable
why hold on to what you have to let go of ?
like , did i really break your heart ?
was it all my fault ?
if you don't knock it off
you know like i know where this was headed
i'm a wanderer
i'm a wanderer , baby
i'm a wanderer
i'm a wanderer
lani kai was nice
turquoise seas and ocean breezes
loving you was nice
but it's a new day , a new season
i’ve been sad inside
and he could see it , picked up your pieces
we are just alike
and alright , alright , alright
he’s a wanderer
he’s a wanderer , baby
he’s a wanderer
he’s a wanderer
i started as a love song
24 years in the making
moving from place to place and
i never really settled down
without a place to call home
i got so used to the changes
moving from stranger to strangest
you should face it
i am crazy
i'm a wanderer
i'm a wanderer , baby
i'm a wanderer
i'm a wanderer
shame on me for changing
no , shame on you for staying the same
shame on me for changing
no , shame on you for staying the same
i'm a wanderer
i'm a wanderer , baby
i'm a wanderer
i'm a wanderer
maybe i'm just a wanderer
maybe i'm just a wanderer
