at forty - four minutes to four
an angel walked up to my door
opened the windows to my soul
told me he thinks that i should know
there's no slowing down
as the globe spins 'round and 'round
you better keep going , better keep going
better keep going , you better keep going
better keep going , you better keep going
you better keep going , you better keep going
you better keep going
if there's one thing that i learned
while in those county lines
it's that everything takes time
you have gotta lose your pride
you have gotta lose your mind
just to find your peace of mind
you have got to trust the signs
everything will turn out fine
so why aren't you smiling ? why aren't you smiling ?
life can get wild when you're caught in the whirlwind
lost in the world when you're chasing the win
you gotta understand
there's really no end , there's really no beginning
there's really no real , there's really no pretending
there's really no fail , there's really no winning
cause nothing really is , and everything really isn't
at forty - four minutes to four
an angel walked up to my door

that's why i keep going
that's why i keep going , i gotta keep going
i gotta keep going , i gotta keep going
i gotta keep going , gotta keep going
gotta keep going
i gotta show them that i can keep going
i gotta keep going , i gotta keep going
i gotta keep going
why aren't you smiling ? why aren't you smiling ?
