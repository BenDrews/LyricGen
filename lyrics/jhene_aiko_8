( twinkle ) little ( star )
how i wonder what you ( are )
sing it , nami !
i've been coming home late night
i've been sleeping past daylight
i'm waking up , you're not by my side
baby , that ain't right
i wanna be there with you
i really do be missing you
everything i do is for you
and i really do adore you
you're getting so big now
and you're making me so proud
cause you are such a star
and you know that you are
so every single little moment
i can't be there to hold your hand
i need for you to know that
i need for you to know that
anything should happen , anything should happen
cause anything could , if anything should happen
know that you'll be alright , know that you'll be alright
just promise you'll be alright , promise you'll be alright
if anything ( alright , promise i'll be alright )
( promise i'll be alright , promise i'll be alright )
if anything should happen ( promise i'll be alright )
( promise i'll be alright , promise i'll be , promise i'll be alright )
swear that i can still feel you here
i just can't believe you're not here
i've been needing you
all i dream is you
i don't think i can make it
i don't think i can make it
but then i hear you say that
i bet not do nothing crazy
cause nami really needs you
and i would never leave you
cause i am in the stars
and everywhere you are
and every single little moment
and every single bit of sunshine
just know that i am right by your side
know that you are right by my side
so i'm gonna make you so proud
and you don't ever have to worry 'bout me
no , you don't ever have to worry 'bout me
promise i'll be alright , promise i'll be alright
wish that you were here now
i'm missing you right here but
promise i'll be alright , promise i'll be alright
promise i'll be alright , promise i'll be , promise i'll
promise i'll be alright , just know that i'll be alright
know that i'll be alright , know that i'll be , know that i'll be alright
alright
alright , alright , alright
alright , alright , alright
everything is alright , everything's in your mind
and life is what you make it , life is what you make it
and anything can happen , anything can happen
but you just gotta get past it , you just gotta laugh at it
anything can happen , you fall down get back up
and you better believe that nothing holding me back
so everything is alright , everything is alright
everything is alright , promise i'll be
promise you'll be , promise we'll be alright
