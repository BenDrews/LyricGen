it's the wanting you
never getting you
keeps me wanting you
missing you
just to picture you , is what gets me through
fit for you
i was meant for you
what i was sent to do , meant to do
wasn't meant for you
hope i said that shit right
cause if i never had you
then i could never lose you
do you know what might happen
if i decide to choose you
then the world may just stop spinning
it may just well be the ending
talking all about existance
who knows ?
that i cannot see tomorrow
if you're not in my tomorrow
uh oh
i'm.....tryna save the world
how can i when
you belong to me
i belong to them
who do i give me to ? who do i let win ?
you or the world
you or the world
your light shines so bright it's like two stars colliding
we'll only survive if we fight it , don't fight it
yeah
cause if i really have to
then you know i would chose you
do you know what would happen
if i ever lose you
then my heart would just stop beating
and my mind would just stop thinking
and my strengths would turn to weakness
you know
but i cannot see tomorrow
if you're not in my tomorrow
uh oh
i've.....gotta save the world
how can i when
you belong to me
but i belong to them
who do i give me to ? who do i let win ?
you or the world
you are my world
