life ain't real , more like a dream
jump in a sauna , let off steam
won't get out till i feel all clean
jump on the wave or get left
if you can't swim , that's your death
jaw's all swinging like barley and meth
omg , look at this mess
don't want mandy , no , i'm blessed
i've got cheese and hennessy water
i've got cheese and hennessy water

thinking " how did he turn this round ? "

when he's so elusive , exclusive
new with the bar ? " cuh we do this
i'm industry nuisance , i love when they put in their two pence
and they don't wanna make no movements
but they're playing my blueprints
what i'm saying sounds like i chew mints , it's incredible
even credible rappers are now edible
durrty goodz is a bloodclart general
