ugh , shorty old news though
yesterday's paper
check this !
baby like it raw , i don't even waste a magnum on her
clean up amazing , i appreciate the fashion on her
badder than a motherfuck , ain't too many passin' on her
only right i pick her up , the way she got a wagon on her
when i'm on that road , don't forget the bops when i'm in town
not unless it's for the threesome , if it's poppin' she'll be down
know these other jokers be starin' , but it stop when i'm around
just to get inside them jeans she be hoppin' up and down
let the world know that she ride
they think that eventually we'll break up
and i love it when we argue , ‘cause eventually we make up
i mean , we fight and fuck , we fuck and fight
we fuck some more , every fuckin' night
shape great , taste great , body softer than cashmere
anytime her cheques drop she knows she can crash here
them other broads is other broads , all of them is last year
can't get mad , i'm just stating facts here
she don't put it down - down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
girl , you working with the killer
ain’t nobody fuckin' with ya
she don’t put it down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
never trippin' off the past , i would rather never mind 'em
‘cause only fools trip over somethin' that be behind 'em
and yesterday is history , tomorrow's a mystery
she here at the present time , it feel like a gift when she
put it down , down , all the way down
you could get down , but can you stay down ?
shout out to the ladies with your down asses
that keep a tight circle and them round asses ( nice ! )
at the crib , it's just us , nigga
fuck me so good , make me not trust niggas
that's my shit , i'm overprotected
you want that good shit ? you know where your connect live
told my ex : " don't be bitter , be better. "
i replace her before i regret her
texts now and then that question how i been
the hook sound like a message i would send
she don't put it down - down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
girl , you working with the killer
ain’t nobody fuckin' with ya
she don’t put it down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
a down girl , i remember when
i used to bag up in the basement with her
with the attraction of a michael jackson swag
but in this case a thriller
and she was a wolf , not in sheep's clothing
but a gray chinchilla
even though i found another assassin
it can never be your replacement killer
when i got up in the goods kinda good to me
but i know that she don't put it down like you
cut from the bottom when you up
when you pop on top , ‘cause nobody around like you
pulling back to me and i'm all up in it fully
when i'm pulling a palm full of hair
finna lay you on your back , missionary position
and give it to you good with your louboutins in the air
got a bad new bitch , but she don't be trippin'
don't cross with them flaws
but she don't be doing the way you be doing it
when you be working them walls
i’m bumpin' some tank and i'm plankin'
i'm fuckin' her good , but then you go frontin'
steady cuttin' with bitches all on me
‘cause i'm with joe budden , but what ho wasn't
i'll put you in the category of somebody
that give it to me good but will work a nigga nerves
individual and i'm never particular
but i'll never be with her , so i kick her to the curb
i got a new woman though
i be building her up to be better than you
she fine , but don't know how to throw it back
so she can never be you
i done put another in your space
damn , after you it’s been hard to replace
i just want the same judge sittin’ on the case
she gon’ hate , but she know
she don't put it down - down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
girl , you working with the killer
ain’t nobody fuckin' with ya
she don’t put it down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
