she ain’t got a leg to stand on
don’t even trip
i can take you all over the world though
even tell you pack light
the last slide couldn’t even get a cab ride
she don’t do the blogs , but if she did , she’d be on mad sites
ass so mean that i’m always on her bad side
uh , now she don’t ever stress me ’bout my whereabouts
never seems concerned
with other birds that she may hear about
she mind hers , since mine's hers
that shit she barely care about
look amazing on me , why i’m always tryna wear her out
she don’t ride like you , no , she don’t taste like that
not with a waist like that , do i let her go to waste like that ?
she a mix between kama sutra , yoga and porno flicks
funny how her breath get shorter when i give her long dick
uh , and i’m telling y’all straight up
might think i imagined shorty even when she not made - up
she kill ‘em in levi’s , see why ? it ain’t even fair
look good in whatever she wear
how could other women compare ? they can’t
i done put another in your space
damn , after you , it’s been hard to replace
i just want the same judge sitting on the case
she gon' hate , but she know
she don’t put it down like you , down - down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you , down - down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
girl , you working with the killer
ain’t nobody fucking with ya
she don’t put it down like you , down - down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
i can see the stars in the day time
bitch , i miss you , like a deadline
and the girl i’m with is just the girl i’m with
i mean it’s working out , so we’re staying fit
but you know love is nothing ; ask stan smith
but i gotta keep a bad bitch , like brad pitt
remember our first kiss ? or our last kiss ?
i used to go dummy in that pussy ; crash test
you be fuckin' that nigga like you was fucking me ?
ha , fuck that nigga ! he can’t fuck with me
i’m tunechi , bitch , and you know that
and that pussy throw back
but any given night , i’d still pop that ass , like a prozac
girl , you know you got that murder , a beast in that la perla
and every time we cut , i used to shred her ; ninja turtles
and i know you still love me , and i know you still for me
that’s why we still fuckin'
‘cause she don’t put it down like you
i done put another in your space
damn , after you , it’s been hard to replace
i just want the same judge sitting on the case
she gon' hate , but she know
she don’t put it down like you , down - down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you , down - down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
girl , you working with the killer
ain’t nobody fucking with ya
she don’t put it down like you , down - down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
love being around mine , no downtime
still nothing else even matters
can’t even walk slow through that mall
‘cause paparazzi running after
baby girl working it like a pro , slow it down or move it faster
whether them lights on or them lights off
like i’m sleeping with the clapper
say she watching what she eat , yet that ass keep getting fatter
how i’m sexing her
makes that ex of hers no longer be a factor
plus her and i already know , you done turn them all to casper
climb with the former rather latter
you already know which one i’d rather cum on
i done put another in your space
damn , after you , it’s been hard to replace
i just want the same judge sitting on the case
she gon' hate , but she know
she don’t put it down like you , down - down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you , down - down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
girl , you working with the killer
ain’t nobody fucking with ya
she don’t put it down like you , down - down like you
down - down like you , down - down like you
she don’t put it down like you
