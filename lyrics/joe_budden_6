what am i afraid of ?
this is supposed to be what dreams are made of
but people i don't have the time to hang with
always look at me and say the same shit
they say you promised you would never change
i just feel like you broke a promise to me
only hurt cause i thought you were being honest with me
so i’m gon' try and do this honorably
without the sponsoring fee what’s most alarming to me
this so emotional for you , robust such the calm in me ,
easy to put off notes in thugs harmony
speak to his insecurity , acting so irresponsibly
and it's further impacted by the fact that you respond to me
see some of us know you as jimmy barely old
he had the baby belly fro , nigga was frail up in his clothes
barely got a hold and it’s seeming very outta control
wish we could go back and grab the blackberry with the scroll , oh
yeah aubrey that’s the one we trusted
not this new aubrey with his stomach sculpted
i'm disgusted , you're such a fuckin' incumbent
can't govern , trust in the public becoming a fucking puppet
it’s bigger than rap battles , a word for the digital cash castle don’t let a glitch in the mac crash you
unrelaxed wearing political straps tackled
now clash paths with dad , the original bad apple
i know where you at , shit i was there too
when shit was happening fast , word , i got scared too
impossible feats , impossible to sleep
making promises impossible to keep like
what am i afraid of ?
this is supposed to be what dreams are made of
but people i don't have the time to hang with
always look at me and say the same shit
they say you promised you would never change
listen , alert the niggas that handle you
you fill up tour seats but you raw meat to the animals
doggy to cannibal , morning coffee and sandal shoes
can’t get this energy off me , it isn’t tangible
this shit is greater than me , pitchfork and fader agree
complex i’m waiting to see , this between us , a and b
you on the cusp rated g , film i ain’t paying to see
i’m patiently waiting with please
thought you would take it in , breathe
blatantly seein' his whole channel real a&e
hard to sound empty inside and fill a vacancy
get some advice , come over kick it and vibe
i’m here with hotels , strippers , odell , all that shit that you like
we'll light some candles and some hookah
hookers flickin' the lights
we'll play aaliyah's greatest hits , you'll get all tickled inside
my nigga , it's no wonder you're losing all your friends
poster child now for all that you had a wall against
and tell your mans i’ll be seeing him soon
he marched you right into this madness i got reason to assume
i creep in his room , sweeper consumed
now his region of doom ain’t the legion of boom it's just me with a broom
afterward i’m thinking we can resume a lesson in speaking too soon
how is it too late if i’m reading ya tomb
it's not , boys inordinate , ploys and ornaments
show up at party next door with a noise ordinance
so off the hook of me , maybe y'all should be shook of me
should know i’d kill him at even the slightest push of me
and when his team press up shirts , i’ll help 'em push a tee , should it read , he pressed buttons but wouldn’t push a tee
gotta be buggin' , maybe he dunno where pusha be
or when pusha push the agenda he isn’t pushed to see
if pushed to the streets , i see wood in your physique
thinking you misunderstood my hood , this isn’t meek nigga
this ain’t a standard that you couldn’t meet
just from your views , you prolly couldn’t see
that's cool , that kind of success you could never plan for it
heard the question nigga , i’ma help you answer it
