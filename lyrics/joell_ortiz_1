how many times i gotta tell y'all i'm second to none ?
no magazine's top ten cause i'm negative one
so i don't pay attention to them dumb folk
cause i'mma always be in first like the clutch broke
i'm from where the cut - throats cut coke
cause school ain't cut it , they cut out to puff smoke
and guess what ? that's who i hang with
so when you speak industry , i don't know the language
but play a beat and i'll show you why i'm head honcho
y'all gettin' away with murder like the white bronco
bunch of trash in - between hooks
bars too cute to be gettin' all these mean looks
put the hottest rappers all on one stage together
see who'll hold they arm up like che guevera
i rhyme hotter and i say it better
i'mma win the cold war : i'mma product of the reagan era
dave dinkins of the page inkin''
my 16s free y'all , i'm hip - hop's abe lincoln
fam i don't know what they thinkin'
these niggas got me fucked up like i spent all day drinkin'
i'm a boss , not a loss yet
you're little lemons in a race with a souped - up corvette
i'm so hot i could stand still and pour sweat
in the north pole , fully naked with my balls wet
i'm a monster - these other niggas small pets
claim they sick , but they get cured by your dog's vet
i'm thorough from my yank' to my gore - tex
you're bluffin' , i play poker - i'm callin' all bets
local boy , when's the last time you all left ?
i don't even know where the fuck i'm goin' on tour next
last month canada , before that ? europe
i had waffles out in belguim , you ain't had syrup
every time i write , it's another flight
another whore with my kids on her underbite
another " yaowa ! " i chant when i touch the mic
another magazine spread , yeah you fuckin' right
i'm on my grind like a pair of in - line skates
get on tracks and go bananas like a primate
baboon , gorilla , chimpanzee , a wild ape
king kong when he escape , i'm 'bout to skyscrape
but the sky ain't the limit
i could teleport through my mind any minute
take you to a place where the lions go " ribbit "
all the frogs " roar " and the fire is frigid
i'm outta this world , don't belong here
what good is heiring the throne if i taught you from a small chair ?
family , you niggas got it twisted
flow out of the box , yours chicken and a biscuit
give me chicken pox when i listen , i be itchin'
to cripple your career like a ligament is missin'
dawg i'm on a mission like an intimate position
when i swing it's knockouts i ain't gettin' a decision
from here on , it's locked : y'all a prisoner to spittin'
can't escape my bars : no visitors permitted
welcome to hell where joell holds a pitchfork
and you burn in eternal flames for your bitch - talk
dick in my hand : i'm pissed off
but i ain't bucklin' , everyday i'm hustlin' : rick ross
one day the whole globe will know that i'm clark kent
underneath the shades on a project park bench
superman when i grip the mic
the only way i'm slowin' down is if i blow a pound of kryptonite
from now on i'm a bully , i'mma pick the fight
let them pick you up off the ground when i chip ya bite
you'll become a little memory : gigabyte
me and these beats got married , i'm mr. right
little man , you spit it aight
i'm on fire , you got a little buzz : miller lite
man there's so many words runnin' 'round my brain
if i don't put them on a track i would go insane
maybe that's why everything i say is crazy
and everyday i wake up , with a naked lady
with a v.i.p. band on my right wrist
pants on the floor , j.d. with a slight sip left in the bottle
'telly key on the nightstand
i go to the bathroom to pee , and then i scram
i live the life of a rock star
they ain't wanna let me through , so i became a cop car
put the sirens on every time i touch a pen
everybody move like dope : that's a fuckin' '10'
my peers know i'm gonna win
this music's like my first crush , for years i wanted in
i'm here. oh boy will you taste the wrath
i'mma make it ugly like what's underneath jason's mask
i listen to a lot of mixtapes and laugh
all y'all niggas do is whine like jamaican ass
every night i celebrate , we take a glass of champagne to the brain
sometimes we take a bath
victory feels far better
than defeat ; you niggas weak : solar's letter
i'm harder than the fonz' leather
my worst rhyme's 30 times rougher than your hottest bars ever
i could front like a car fender
cause everything i'm on , djs pull up like the bartenders
new york i'm the answer to your prayers
head - nod music , leave the dancin' over there
project shit , ain't no mansion over here
just murder on the strings , charles manson on the snare
i'm hungry ; the game's like a food court
i just gave y'all a loose hundred : newports
chea
joell ortiz
who feel they , who feel they better ?
