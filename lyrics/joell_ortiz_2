yo , do me a favor
accidently step on your white sun glasses
we don't wear those over here , this is hip hop ( that's right )
this is carhartt jackets
timberland boots , unlaced
this is champion hoodies , chicken wings and french fries
rip pieces on the handball court
this is us still fightin' police brutality , this is hip hop
i ain't tryin' to bring new york back
i'm just a breath of fresh air , that good old new york rap
slick talk to the track , c'mon , who brought that to the game ?
graffiti all on the train , get up your name
i don't feel how i used to feel
i'm in my 20's so a new nas joint used to give me the chills
in the barber shop tryin' to cop a new hot tape
them rob lowes is crazy , the doo wop's great
it's hip hop… and yes , i'm a fan first
if you from the south , finger snap till your hands hurt
if you from the west , w's in the air
if you from the east coast , act like you from here
the good old two - step , the classic head nod
the thirsty iced grill , who wants to get robbed ?
that was the energy in the club
on the real , that was the energy that i loved
aww , man , this is hip hop
hands up if you forever a fan of hip hop
i wake up hip hop , go to sleep hip hop
dream about hip hop , ‘cause i am hip hop
i ain't tryin' make you dance i just rip beats
but the soul in my voice give you quick feet
i don't know what it's like to not dig deep
when i'm holding this mic i don't just speak , pipsqueak
the tides come in and the earth shakes
200 hundred mile an hour winds , i'm your worst fate
birthdate : july 6th 1980
how can your age even matter when you rhyme this crazy ?
aww , man , i gotta thank the lord
‘cause with this pen in my hand , i don't think that hard
it just happens , wrist action , classic in the makin'
i kick back and just laugh , i'm happy , i'm amazin'
look at me , gaze into my eyes , see the poverty ?
now understand why me and this music just gotta be ?
it's something that's inside of me
and i can't shake it , so i embrace it , and let y'all taste it
somethin' happen to may body when that track smokin'
y'all swim more wilder than me , i be backstrokin''
i'm the best and my fans'll second that notion
i'll be the last man standing with my back broken
crack open a couple of 40's , celebrate mijo
my competition , man , they squared in the h3
i run circles around them like a skate key
and turn your little buzz into " yo , whatever happened… ? "
so don't play , b , i ain't talking shit
i just got a awful gift that'll make your office doors just stiff
they won't open , so no braggin'
and no boastin' while i'm hungry
matter of fact , don't do that when i got a lot of money
yup , i'm feelin' myself , that sound right
you gotta step in that ring like , " listen , i'll pound mike "
you gotta step on that court like , " i could hold down mike "
the way i step on that stage and have the whole crowd like…
