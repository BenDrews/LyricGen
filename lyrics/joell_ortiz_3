one quarter of the slaughter reporting to you live from across the water
in jersey where i just bought a condominium , i see the city from my balcony
sipping gin with a grin for everyone who had it out for me
nah i ain't flossing i just told you i had mouths to feed
and a grandma that told me from her death bed she was proud of me
ya'll hear a beat , i don't hear just music i hear an opportunity a chance and i won't lose it
they told me i was fat , rhymed too hard , i need some smooth shit
tried to blackball me but i'm awesome with my pool stick
mice in every glue trap , roaches everywhere , piss on every stair
uh oh momma we're out of here
i made the studio my home , the streets i left them flat
sold the rest of my crack , and started blessing these tracks
the rest of it is a wrap , my knapsack on my back
tracy gives me a hug and eminem gives me dap
i'm writing choruses meta - morphed into morpheus
putting verses into coffins its just another day at the shady office
bet awards was just a sneak peak at the power house
wipe your feet , may 15th ya'll welcome to our house
rap fans made who feel like weed heads in a sour drought
we got that fire , i walk on the stage and a yaowa i shout and they shout higher
i'm dressing flyer , but biggie smalls was no liar
more money more problems so though i try to be a better father baby momma's not in tune
i got another hearing down for child support in june
bitch , you wasn't with me writing in my room...
bitch , you wasn't with me writing in my room
where i dismantled pianos and a violin was doomed
cuz my voice turns everything into a light under a spoon
i'm more than dope , they try to cope with the fact that i'm no joke
but it's hard to not feel burnt when you out here getting smoked
so one day someone will loc and think he's billy the kid
and i'll show billy the kids just offspring of the g.o.a.t
i'm earl manigault , when i twirl my hand i assault every damn man in the sport
so don't stand foot on the court unless you're a baller
me i look at the ref and i smile
i'm such a word smith i anticipate a technical foul
why you pulling on my jersey , you want to know me baby ?
telly cost a buck fifty like kobe's lady
how you going to tell a genius nigga don't be crazy ?
i don't believe in if , try , can't , almost , or maybe
i get it done , nothing to it , but do to do it no excuses
point your finger in the mirror if you blew it fucker
