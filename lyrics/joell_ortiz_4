y'all know me , i flex muscle on anything , ain't a beat safe
can't just go flaunting that heat in joell ortiz' face
been hoping that a frog would jump , it's so much leap space
but yeah , nobody took to the air , i got their feet placed
firmly on the pavement , nobody want it with greatness
i'm mean mugging these niggas and never getting a facelift
how is he your favorite ? them bars he give up is basic
guess niggas start sounding better when yaowa take a vacation
i've been running around the world with the slaughter , but boy i'm back
get ya papi right back out on that corner with all the crack
a couple kilos of raw , just shot a couple of packs
and a couple of y'all'll flip if a couple'll spit out this mack
man , the whole block changed , this the hip hop game ?
sweet kool - aid running through niggas' popped veins
must a brooklyn enigga come through again ? pop chains
smack niggas and make 'em dissapear like it's pop's name
this my playground , be scared when i swing through
fear when i slide by , y'all seesaw what the kid do
i was hot when i was a baby , on fire as a young toddler
dry ice as a teen , todya i'm made out of lava
i swear to god when i say i'm the best , man , i really mean it
not confident or conceited , just standing here undefeated
please don't be fooled by the quantity from these heathens
when your head is full of air you could do a lot of leaking
see my name next to it , know a flame swept through it
and that's the song on the joint where the mixtape get stupid
got throwaway bars that could go invade mars
and i hang with the kind of marshall that don't tow away cars
5 am - that's the time i set my alarm
wash up , throw on sweats , go jogging along the pond
that's what i call a river my condo is sitting on
which house has the pretty stars y'all niggas just wish upon
you could kiss joell , baby , just don't kiss and tell
you ain't gotta tweet me , my digits is in your cell
please no instagram , a picture can only tell
a thousand words , have a million positions all to yourself
my personal life is private , my public life is a riot
write on so many planes , my pen of choice is a pilot
diffent currensy , different customs , my body is tired
but everything is working out , so yeah , i decided to dye it
lost a couple of lb's , no more triple xl tees
and my pythons look like anacondas , you'll yell please
if i put you in that sleeper , plot a joell squeeze
then tighten it to your knees , give in and you spell z's
you know i can really fight , right nigga ?
your man'll think i'm wrong if the right , right'll hit ya
your face gone look like a great white bite ripture
two evenings in a row , yeah , night , night nigga
i've been jumping hurdles since excitebite , nigga
you probably was with your sister making light bright pictures
i came up in the projects , you niggas ain't that wild
walking up the stairs i was crunching up crack vowels
walking outside , i was ducking their clap louds
sounded like a m.o.p. kind of record , click clack blow
see , stand - up niggas get easily sat - down
and the cops get there three hours later for pat - downs
i've been rhyming forever , forever been seeming short
infinity is like a blur , i'll never run out of thought
broke as a motherfucker , i still held down the fort
respect don't have a price tag , some things can't be bought
i was schooled by the og's , right up under the action
bottom of 40 tapping , right there on kingsland and jackson
dopeboy fashion , ropes , gold caps , girbauds and bo jacksons
when starter hats was snapping
funny , i'm just rhyming , y'all listening like i'm snapping
any rapper indirects , i'll be listening like ''what happened ? ''
i gotta make sure i ain't gotta go break jaws
or have my goons in your hotelroom on the 8th floor
before this twitter shit y'all ain't even know i was funny
cause in every rhyme i uttered i gave you the gutter from me
i got a sense of humor , see , i ain't have a choice
your jokes had to be fly when you came up bummy
nope , no money , yup , so hungry
when food fell on the floor we picked it up in a hurry
saying ''god made dirt'' and dirt don't hurt
really , i stomach like throwing that out ain't gone work
yeah , i started from the bottom now i'm here
not the top , not the bottom , i'm somewhere
in the middle , not coach , not a layer
ain't wake up in a new bugatti , but i steer
through these new york streets , i see clear in my rear
- view - mirror all the bad bitches stare
guess i'm rolling smooth enough to things i'm doing in this truck
please , no jury duty , man , i swear ( no joke )
anyway , to all my fans , yo , i'm sorry
i gotta end this verse , but these niggas know they can't harm me
don't ever try to keep me out the party
invited or uninvited , i'll be in there with my army
