uh
yea
don't confuse me with joey badass neither
hahaha
its awol$ nigga !
i been looking down the road of the riches
say hello to all the folks that sold they soul just to get it
burn in hell for the money that you earn while you living
got bars like san quitten and a flow thats so explicit
i be reaching goals with no equipment
i been transmitting tracks to get reactions when they listen
just imagine the talent it takes when crafting every sentence
with a passion and a vision , not passive i stay consistant
to rapping i'm so committed , not stagnant im loading writtens
then blast at my competition even though they don't exist you get it
these critics really say i'm unorthodox
16 but i'm old enough to call the shots
a song i dropped record labels call to sign me on the spot
i cause a lot of commotion from nothing now i'm on the top
so call the cops
i jus blew up its like a mortar popped don't talk a lot
i jus kill a verse and then the floor get mopped
body bagging beats tripple beaming bitch my bars is hot
no need to intervene
when niggas scheme to see me fall and stop need more than props
i need respect , power , porscha drops
i ain't signing nothin unless they offer what they offered pac
and big
to the top i slid , the top notch kid
rolls royce phantoms just for me to hotbox in
since i dropped in the game , now they watch my pen
with nonstop sin they can't say i'm not top ten
so why stop when , the fans say that i be spitting napalm
born to die
so i ain't scared just tell em keep my grave warm
buried with my chains on , not adolf
so try an touch my jewels i promise you i'll cut ya face off
its apparent no comparing , i spit quicker then a chainsaw ,
with half a verse or half a clip i'm only letting 8 off , then take off
blvck scale hoodie in the cut look like i'm trayvon
ipod shuffle , in the duffle bumping raekwon
tape ammunition on a mission to get fame a long barrel barreta
under pressure going awol
scopes on the dresser same place that i put the k on
i'm abouta kill the game with 40 glocks in they face drawn
momma need the money so do i , tell her stay strong
i swear ima get rich i promise it ain't gon take long
honestly watching the top , gun in my sock
niggas that want me to flop none of them wanna get shot
don't trust these niggas
one thing i learned from my pops
kill em with writtens or off of the top
all of these niggas belong in a box
i just pay attention
make decisions on the verge of a lot
i'll never stop , till my heart beat slows up
racing to the top hit the pedal hear the motor
instrumentals in a cobra clutch these niggas froze up
plus they flow stolen meaning that these niggas owe us
