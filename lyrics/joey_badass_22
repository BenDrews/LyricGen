at a passing glance of a tumblr timeline it'd be easy to mistake chicago's chance the rapper for any number of new jack blog - savvy revivalist rappers struggling their way around high - pitched pharcyde chatter and " 93 til infinity " instrumentals. and certainly the production on acid rap , with its sampled nods to j dilla and tribe called quest , leans towards that sort of single - minded throwback. but as a rapper , chance's nostalgia is immersive , not constructed. it's telling that he openly cites the influence of under - heralded west coast crew freestyle fellowship , a collective that emphasized perpetual stylistic reinvention on a micro level ( and provided the big bang for both pharcyde and souls of mischief's elastic flows ) . so where the a$aps of today pick up hand - me - down and watered down cadences and beat at them repeatedly and the joey badasses struggle through existing patterns that are usually far above their competency level , chance is going back to the point of origin and rebuilding the old styles from scratch. every track here is kicked in a different cadence—usually jazzy and always frantic—and it's striking to hear that model applied by a young rapper whose raw foundational material is kanye and eminem. he's using the same toolbox as the greats but drawing on very different blueprints.
chance's writing takes a similarly expansive approach to history. for a 20 - year - old , chance's point of view is oddly melancholic and sentimental , but this perspective only strengthens his narratives. he writes with a vivid sensory memory—you can smell the blunt guts or hear the fireworks and mistake them for gunfire in his words. it's a paradoxically level - headed approach on an album where the performance is so unhinged and the second line is " the acid made me crazy. " but maybe the title—and chance's whole woody woodpecker meltdown rap style—is a bit of a misdirect. acid rap isn't about the trip , it's about the flashbacks. —andrew nosnitsky
