with words that will break skull and bones

his fans hope he gets writers block
before he get stomped on the curb
and ain't no n*gga gon' stop

better stay on the guitar
this is close up & personal
while i'm shootin for the stars
new york n*ggas prolly take kendrick la - m with an ar
watch ken drip from far
watch the swimming pool flood
of my favorite rappers blood
while i play the heart

i bet i sound like stan in the dark
past my time , insanely
so i could of bodied you crazy
left ya ass in section 80
& if you loose it , please stop
with ya lucid dreams of pac

i raised the bar so far up
i'm drunk and high by scott

then make em scream uncle
till somebody scream murda
n*gga this the best control verse
even if unheard of
stab nicky in her dimples
fuck her till silicon seeps out her ass and nipples
and big sean
how is it your song
and you got belittled
fuck a metaphor
you got bodied and crippled
dropped the ball
ain't got no control no dribble
ya'lll trash straight land fill
tyler and earl make joey badass milk
expired time with that 90's rhyme
like 99 would stand still
stealing flows back then like that would prolly get ya ass killed
but yg , roscoe , flocka flame
spit dry shit like the lips on gucci mane
wiz keep coming with that reg shit but still give chest pain
wacker than 2chainz
wale for all you n*ggas

and that ain't it
only king remembered is big
ain't no shit bout krit
mgk could spit some shit
but frenchie ain't got no witt
if so where it at ?
you trippin like acid rap
rappers won't get a chance at that
i slam these rappers like doors and draws
i pull ya card every time i draw
i paint a perfect picture
but a n*gga can't draw
any battle can't be a draw
a verse from me bodies them all
andre on knight
i rise you fall
kyrie on knight
i'm the wrong n*gga to cross
it's clearly on sight
you can't see ?
i ball
or will soon
n*gga give room
i get excited when i'm claustrophobic
compact words run out my head
i place em smooth
these n*ggas know it
running on thoughts
turned into run on sentences
then i made em rhyme
by jr high
teachers knew i was blessed with this
since grade 7
age 12 or 11
fifth grade i sent my imaginary friends to heaven
like the dogs in the disney movie
don't come to me with pussy and weed
i'm busy stupid
stupid busy
while y'all busy doing stupid shit
i'm tryna get it
and you giving nothing
for a future life with no life to live
