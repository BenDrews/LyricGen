the 104 album challenge is a remix of the 104 book challenge. rather than reading two books a week , genius users plan on listening to two albums every week. only albums released in 2016 count. there are no notability criteria , and mixtapes and eps both count. it must have at least three tracks , or a running time of over 15 minutes.
to make things easier , we've broken it down into months of the year. list your username and the 8 albums you've listened to this month ( or more ) . we encourage you to annotate them with a short review of the album. see an example from january 2015 below.
