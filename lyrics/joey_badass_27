put a sword in em torment em whoever's recording em
a fetus in matrix with liquid and cord in em
got the coordinates unplug you they must have bugged you trust you won't be talking that after i finish crushing you
we all from a dysfunctional background don't hide behind that
this is culture slim we die behind that
fraudulent corporate puppet you's simp in the system conflicted
one day you conscious then u call women bitches
stupid smile ass rapper foul ass rapper
for disrespecting ya idol with ya lying ass rapper
uni - brow ass rapper sound sour ass rapper
chop ya head off now a fraud turned halal ass rapper
6'4 still an insecure ass rapper
immature can tell who you get ya format after
with ya boring ass cookie cutter doormat rapper
corny punchlines weak metaphor ass rapper
kanye west was taking a hospital
kicking a man while he's down is diabolical
you could have chopped it with em u looking for promotion
that's some sucka shit we don't respect the way that you approached it
you just a tourist trying to play on what culture feel
flower pot head now watch the sun light up ya chlorophyll
warriors build you wouldn't know nothing for real about it
forest hill ? i put ya face inside a foreman grill
congratulations u got money and a fan base
invited at the white house gave obama a handshake
i'm with prime time and papers on the block
you was low key bumping ye praying for him to flop
what them lil dreads represent ya stylist made u do that ?
with that fake ass humble image we hate when u do that
you disappointed nas when he pressed play
you a stan obsessed with making records to impress jay
dame would said pause i gotta chop his head off
drove by em ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥and then i sped off
this is disrespect catch post traumatic like 'nam vet
i got complex no condom inside ya ex
dominant in the flesh leave the comments for the press
donald trump just got elected kid my timing is best
verse 2 : napoleon da legend
ndl , bumrushing this rap shit
pharaohgamo bumrushing this rap shit
napoleon da legend running this rap shit
you ain't nothing more than pawn you a rapping unicorn
corporate rapper in a simple man uniform
rapping other famous rappers rhymes when u perform
behind the scenes getting screwed like u in a porn
peace jermaine nice to know hate to do this to ya but
you choice of words are unwise put a bullet thru you
how you in the game this long but still moving like a novice
hov is great but had to put his student in the coffin
kendrick dissed u in control and u ain't say nothing back
taking it out vert and yatchty yous a bum for that
jermaine cole if u humble then remain so
biting joey badass used the same flow say it ain't so
the chicken came roost u gotta pay now
next single talking about you let jay down
started singing like you was drake i'm a slice that cake
then i'll usher ya woke ass right up to ya wake
then smack u of out element ya relatives crying
beating me there's a better chance of elephants flying
dumbo with the big ears always rocking a long face
looking like the kid that's always stuck up in the wrong place
i see right thru your design u a c celebrity looking for celebrity cuties to shine
bombshell to head u just cute with rhyme
if u apply now u can be a student of mine
i can teach u how to grind from bottom without a co - sign
without a major label just a beat and a dope rhyme
how to really vouch for people without photo op
how to spit with a cheap mic and make ya vocals pop
u tried ya hand now u gotta get checked
bars is coming back this year cole get it correct
so consider this me putting you on notice
no promotion just yo corpse floating in the ocean
cold stone em and son em leaving offspring reverse it
i'm a stone cole steve austin
looking goofy on the court performing in bootie short
6'4 with no game that's why u rap for sport
no memes about me just beats and rhyme
luda i'm a disturb jermaine's peace of mind
take cover i'm a general u just a soldier
chopping tall trees throw the body over my shoulder
