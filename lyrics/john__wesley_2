you win the argument at the end of every night
i never know the perfect time to hit the bedside light
then we lie awake and watch headlights climb the blinds
i want you to know what's going on in my mind
i thought i was immortal a little while ago
i thought that i was right but now i know
i'm wrong about everything , i think that i can sing
and when you hear the song , you'll wanna sing along
i'm wrong about everything think i know what's happening
i think you'll like our song , but i'm wrong
the colors fade to gray and i'm left with black and white
don't know why i try to fight with what is right
the truth is on our lips and it looks like time to tell
but you know i could be wrong about that as well
i thought a happy ending was more or less assured
i thought a little warmth could win the war
i'm wrong about everything , i think that i can sing
and when you hear the song , you'll wanna sing along
i'm wrong about everything , think i know what's happening
i think you'll like our song , but i'm wrong , wrong , yeah
i'll do the best i can to be your lover man
i'll stand corrected just to be elected
i'll do what i can do to get up close to you
listen
i'm wrong about everything , i think that i can sing
and when you hear the song , you'll wanna sing along
i'm wrong about everything , think i know what's happening
i think you'll like our song , i think you'll like our song
i think you'll like our song , but i'm wrong , wrong , wrong
hear the song
hear the song
hear the song
