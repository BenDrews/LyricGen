i’ma start by tying your limbs and take your crying friend
and tie you to him and watch as you’re trying to swim
and even though both of you die in the end
i’ma pretty good story teller and i can pretend
look at the way you judge and you wonder why you’re offended ?
my records are psychopathic and i’ma find the hatchet man
pry the ax from his hand and stab him as fast as i can
there’s no relief now – you can get used to this headache
this life is going by and i refuse to regret it
it’s easy to take your whole life and throw it away
it’s hard to see clearly with that veil over your face
you can’t lie to your demons they know that you’re afraid
and don’t let ghosts that plays game get a hold of your brain
and don’t allow the past to grab at your throat
every breath you take may be the last that you’ll know
high on life and want to write something highly violent
wish i could destroy every vibe and annihilate
every lie inside of me , i take pride in you buying it
speed dial 911 , you’ll be trying to dial it
oh be quiet , we’re all blind pedophiles who violate
writing the downfall of our lives in violet
september 11th , make a child the pilot
do what got done and redefine violent as childish
verbally i use hyperbole purposely
and absurdities occur when words deter you internally
hear the words ; i don’t curr if you’ve heard of me
honestly , i’m rehearsing ; it’s too early for certainties
i admire those making abstinence relevant
but buying a purity ring is plastic and pestilent
backwards intentions , reject truth , and accept lies
stepping outside your beliefs might scare you half to death twice
i’m not scared of death , death is scared of me
but still it’s guaranteed to variously perish me
how many different faces will this mirror see ?
what i hate about confusion in the clarity
just tell the truth , being a liar is tiring
and why i’m writing lines in the privacy of my diary
it’s something that i can live for or die to entirely
are we dead to our desires or alive in the irony ?
pretend nothing is intended argumentative
upset adults come from the sentences , not offended kids
jesus wouldn’t go to church , sick people need the medicine
the medicine’s accepting everyone instead of to hell with them
can you read between the lines or are you like a feminist
crying and whining while slitting wrists on a precipice
or are you the pacifist optimist with the tendencies
to rip ten inches from the appendages of a pessimist
there’s no relief now you can get used to this headache
pretend nothing is intended argumentative
rid yourself of religion and run to love
rid yourself of religion and run to love
is what you believe from hearing your thoughts decide ?
or just a theory you can empirically falsify
what you want to hear won’t be appearing across the sky
and if what i say has me disappearing you’ll all know why
