i’m doing my best , i’m trying not hate women
so unless i’m at a show , i stand at a safe distance
a statement i mention can make or break the tension
wanting me to pay for dinner when i barely pay attention
in this relationship , it’d be great to blame forgiveness
for the position we’re in yet again to make decisions
to continue on or end this ; admit we mistake our senses
either that or every bit of common sense that they suspended
i’m getting heated just thinking ; somebody please restrain me
before i reach into a daydream and beat this lady
if we relate dreams and death so casually
i want to meet the rest of that family
if we could just chill and relax it wouldn’t have to be
so every little argument attacked us so radically
soon the idea of you coming back to me will be a fantasy
you can call , but that’s the last time i’m answering
this position that we're in to make another decision
to continue on or end it now , we're barely even friends
it’s so cliché , it's just a game we play , there's nothing left to say
except i think it's best that go our separate ways
and if i’m high off of emotion and the memories
and dialing your number i am telling you to let it ring
often it’s easier to stay together , please
understand a heart that breaks , more than likely will forever bleed
and you can go from boys to men on a bended knee
but happy when you’re not is something you cannot pretend to be
maybe for a second but eventually
your life’s a penitentiary free of any empathetic sentencing
its true life is like a box of chocolates
but sometimes you bite into a toxic product
the price of fame is something you cannot deposit
you write the script but cannot change the plot or pause it
the nicest verse can fall asleep on a novice beat
a little care can turn the common to an oddity
if i had the choice i’d be deleting all of me
because i don’t want what’s wrong with me passed to my genealogy
this position that we're in to make another decision
to continue on or end it now , we're barely even friends
it’s so cliché , it's just a game we play , there's nothing left to say
except i think it's best that go our separate ways
“he sounds insecure , and he’s speaking awfully
strange for somebody who’s supposedly a prodigy ? ”
“get what i deserve” how could that be a philosophy ?
it was my fault ; i’m not in need of an apology
you can wish your life away
but it will cost you one day in exchange for every wish that you decide to make
with every wish eventually it will require your entire strength
as you attempt every breath you try to take
and if a life is something that you try to take
you’ll be spending every night awake until your dying day
if you’re consumed in judgmental bigotry
those you’re closest to hope you’re suffering in misery
your reasoning is all a yawn
with hands on your neck i’ll end you with a twist like m. night shyamalan
your relationship’s failing because you’re in it for you
if that’s the way that you do things then marriage isn’t for you
this position that we're in to make another decision
to continue on or end it now , we're barely even friends
it’s so cliché , it's just a game we play , there's nothing left to say
except i think it's best that go our separate ways
