what would i do without your smart mouth ?
drawing me in and you kicking me out
you got my head spinning , no kidding , i can't pin you down
what's going on in that beautiful mind ?
i'm on your magical mystery ride
and i'm so dizzy , don't know what hit me , but i'll be all right
my head's under water but i’m breathing fine
you're crazy and i'm out of my mind
cause all of me loves all of you
love your curves and all your edges
all your perfect imperfections
give your all to me
i'll give my all to you
you're my end and my beginning
even when i lose , i’m winning
cause i give you all of me
and you give me all of you
how many times do i have to tell you ?
even when you're crying , you're beautiful too
the world is beating you down , i’m around
through every mood
you're my downfall , you're my muse
my worst distraction , my rhythm and blues
i can't stop singing , it's ringing in my head for you
my head's under water but i’m breathing fine
you're crazy and i'm out of my mind
cause all of me loves all of you
love your curves and all your edges
all your perfect imperfections
give your all to me
i'll give my all to you
you're my end and my beginning
even when i lose , i’m winning
cause i give you all of me
and you give me all of you
cards on the table , we're both showing hearts
risking it all , though it’s hard
cause all of me loves all of you
love your curves and all your edges
all your perfect imperfections
give your all to me
i'll give my all to you
you're my end and my beginning
even when i lose , i’m winning
cause i give you all of me
and you give me all of you
i give you all of me
and you give me all of you
