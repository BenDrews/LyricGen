when was the last time we got to be 100% real , ya'll ?
i don't want ya'll holding back nothing !
who do we think we are ?
baby , tell me , who do we think we are ?
we made a lot of magic
it’s the only way we know
let’s keep the night fantastic
light it up , tell me more , explore
we love , we love , we love the stars
we could fall so hard
the drinks , the minks , the jewels , the house , the cars
why’d we ball so hard ?
yeah , i’m not afraid to fly
here we are , in the air , barely breathing
and we’re not afraid to die
who do we think we are ?
baby , tell me , who do we think we are ?
who do we think we are ?
baby , tell me , who do we think we are ?
we’ve got a lot of nerve , girl
we walk around here like we own this place
see my jewels dripping on my timberlands
stepping like a criminal , success is so imminent
pink champagne , black rolls royce
eggplant double breasted suit from tom ford
bon voyage , left haters in the fog
look up in the sky , bet you recognize a boss
look into my eyes as i fantasize for us
still actin’ shy like this is summer class crush
money comin’ fast , i’m never in a rush , no
plus another twenty in the tuck
semi in the truck , another forty on the wrist
quarter - mill on my mind got me livin’ like i pitch
dodging robin givens , balling like i’m roger clemens
still in the game , uniform all linen
she get chanel , ski trips to vail
only the highest grade , like trees that i inhale
yeah , i’m not afraid to fly
here we are , in the air , barely breathing
and we’re not afraid to die
who do we think we are ?
baby , tell me , who do we think we are ?
who do we think we are ?
baby , tell me , who do we think we are ?
who do we think we are ?
i don’t know about y’all , but i feel good tonight
there’s something in the air tonight
you know , everyone needs someone to look up to
why shouldn't it be us ?
who do we think we are ?
tell me , who do we think we are ?
who do we think we are ?
tell me , who do we think we are ?
this is our song – our song for the future
