alright
ain't this what you came for ?
don't you wish you came more ?
girl , what you playing for ?
ay , come on
come on let me kiss that
ooh , i know you miss that
what's wrong ? let me fix that
twist that
baby , tonight's the night i let you know
baby , tonight's the night we lose control
baby , tonight you need that , tonight believe that
tonight i'll be the best you ever had
i don't wanna brag , but i'll be
the best you ever had
i don't wanna brag , but i'll be
the best you ever had
i hit you with the best stroke
freestyle and then the breaststroke
til you blowing cigarette smoke
and now the bed's broke
so what we gonna do now ?
fuck it , round two now
work it out , then we cool down
cool down
baby , tonight's the night i let you know
baby , tonight's the night we lose control
baby , tonight you need that , tonight believe that
tonight i'll be the best you ever had
i don't wanna brag , but i'll be
the best you ever had
i don't wanna brag , but i'll be
( give me a little bit of that light - skinned love )
the best you ever had
luda ! listen
you ain't even gotta text me
knowing me and you got that mental telepathy
me be up at the spot , i'll be sending over the chauffeur
rich nigga , bread stay popping like a toaster
nobody come close to me and you together
step under my umbrella
we’ll make it through any weather
except when i make it storm
sex in the greatest form
and hibernate under my body
yep , i keep it warmer than a chinchilla
she know i beat it up like the thrilla in manila
flying my private jet to villas in anguilla
then throw you on a grill
cause seven days a week you’re my five course meal
( for real )
baby , tonight's the night i let you know
baby , tonight's the night we lose control
baby , tonight you need that , tonight believe that
tonight i'll be the best you ever had
i don't wanna brag , but i'll be
the best you ever had
i don't wanna brag , but i'll be
the best you ever had
i don't wanna brag , but i'll be
the best you ever had
