last night was the last night
you'll ever spend alone
couldn’t wait , did it in the living room
soon as i saw you , baby , i had plans
plans to do it 'til we have a baby
even if the world is crazy
pick some names , boy or girl
then we’ll change , change the world
so after you change your clothes
girl , if you change your mind
i’m ready , whatever time
it’s the beginning of forever
you don’t have to call
sometimes you just know
it’s the beginning of forever
you don’t have to end
keep doing it , and doing it again , oh
keep doing it , and doing it again , oh
last time was the last time , i was worn and done
you the best , that's why i want another one
soon as i saw you , baby i had plans
plans to take you to my elevator
and cook a little breakfast later
pick a place and go there , girl
then we’ll change , change the world
