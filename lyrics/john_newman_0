know i've done wrong
i left your heart torn
is that what devils do ?
took you so low
where only fools go
i shook the angel in you
now i'm rising from the ground
rising up to you
filled with all the strength i found
there's nothing i can’t do
i need to know now , know now
can you love me again ?
i need to know now , know now
can you love me again ?
i need to know now , know now
can you love me again ?
i need to know now , know now
can you love me again ?
can you love me again ?
it's unforgivable
i stole and burnt your soul
is that what demons do ?
they rule the worst of me
destroy everything
they bring down angels like you
now i'm rising from the ground
rising up to you
filled with all the strength i found
there's nothing i can’t do
i need to know now , know now
can you love me again ?
i need to know now , know now
can you love me again ?
( can you love me again ? )
can you love me again ?
i told you once , i can’t do this again
do this again , oh lord
i told you once , i can’t do this again
do this again , oh no
i need to know now , know now
can you love me again ?
i need to know now , know now
can you love me again ?
i need to know now , know now
( can you love me again ? )
( can you love me again ? )
can you love me again ?
can you love me again ?
