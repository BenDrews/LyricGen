three years ago when you first met me
i was just a boy that found it hard to speak
i couldn't find the words , i had to watch you leave
now you're coming home to me every night
i talk you through your bad days , i ease your mind
i don't want no other woman by my side
oh no no no , cause lately
we've been getting so close
oh baby , we could grow old old old
i'm not your man
i'm not your man
i'm not your man
oh i'm not your man
every time i call , you say you have no plans
another night together , another night that won't end
there seems to be your body , can i leave my hands
oh baby , we've been getting so close , too close maybe
oh lately , yeah yeah yeah , we could grow old old old
i'm not your man
i'm not your man
i'm not your man
i'm not your man
your man don't treat you , like i do
he's cheating on you , you know it's true
someone's heart is gonna break
you teasing me more , and more , and more everyday
i'm not your man
i'm not your man
i'm not your man
will i ever be your man
mmmmmmm
mmm - yeah - yeah
baby , baby
i'm not your man
