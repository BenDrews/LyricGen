i wanna love you , but it just don't feel right
i really need it , but i can't stay the night
cause you , oh , you never give it up
you , oh , you never give it up , aah
you say you'd wait for me , wait for me
wait 'til i got home
sit me on the sofa but the television on
then show me what , show me what
show me what you need
but the lover in your paper feels a different man to me
i don't feel that , babe
i don't feel that , babe
i don't feel that , babe
i wanna love you , but it just don't feel right
i really need it , but i can't stay the night
cause you , oh , you never give it up
you , oh , you never give it up ( oh because )
i wanna love you , but it just don't feel right
i really need it , but i can't stay the night
cause you , oh , you never give it up ( oh because )
you , oh , you never give it up , aah
you keep on calling me , calling me
calling me for hope
to be honest , every time you call , i'm busy , i can't talk
you're saying it , saying it
saying it , alright
if i could pick up you finally give it up tonight
i don't feel that , babe
i don't feel that , babe
i don't feel that , babe
i wanna love you , but it just don't feel right
i really need it , but i can't stay the night
cause you , oh , you never give it up
you , oh , you never give it up ( oh because )
i wanna love you , but it just don't feel right
i really need it , but i can't stay the night
cause you , oh , you never give it up ( oh because )
