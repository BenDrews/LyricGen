i keep , i keep
calling and calling
then regret it in the morning
i see , i see
the pressure gets boring
but my worries keep on haunting
i've changed , changed
i won't put my trust in you to stay , stay
just keep on feeling me the truth
oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh
i wanna give you my love
i wanna give you my heart
oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh
i wanna give you my love
i wanna give you my heart
oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh
i wanna give you my love
i wanna give you my heart
oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh
i wanna give you my love
i wanna give you my heart
baby... lately
i'm trying , i'm trying
to put my past behind me
you'll see , you'll see
i'm vulnerable and still weak
i feel it when we can't speak
i've changed , changed
i won't put my trust in you to stay , stay
i love this sick i work for you
oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh
i wanna give you my love
i wanna give you my heart
oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh
i wanna give you my love
i wanna give you my heart
oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh
i wanna give you my love
i wanna give you my heart
oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh
i wanna give you my love
i wanna give you my heart
oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh
i wanna give you my love
i wanna give you my heart
oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh
i wanna give you my love
i wanna give you my heart
oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh
i wanna give you my love
i wanna give you my heart
oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh
i wanna give you my love
i wanna give you my heart
