all my heart , all my love
can't give you enough
can't give you enough
all my heart , all my love
can't give you enough
can't give you enough
see i've been pushing you for far too long , baby
the sounds that make this world , the world
when you get home , when you get home
you scream you don't want me no more
and i , how did you ask , how did you ask
i've been here all night long
i've had to face , i've had to face
even if i show you
allright
i cannot take , i cannot take , another morning waking up
when you turn , you turn and say , you turn and say
that you loved me it would be there
i've got to face , i've got to face
that even if i show you
