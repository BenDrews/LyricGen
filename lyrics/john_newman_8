i know i said it , from the start
there ain't no pressure , there will be months apart
but i can feel it , it's kicking me
my paranoia , is back again
so you , you got to stop this , you got to stop this
cause i can taste your broken kiss , your broken kiss
it doesn't stop me to tell you this
no games , are ki - ki - ki - ki - killing me
can't you see , this ain't the way it's meant to be
no games , are ki - ki - ki - ki - killing me
no games baby , no games , alright
it's been six months since this began
on a bedroom floor in a la - la - land
with times are changing , i met your dad
i tell my mother , yo that's not her
so you , you got to stop this , you got to stop this
cause i can taste your broken kiss , your broken kiss
it doesn't stop me to tell you this
no games , are ki - ki - ki - ki - killing me
can't you see , this ain't the way it's meant to be
no games , are ki - ki - ki - ki - killing me
