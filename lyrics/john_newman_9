something feels kinda special
something feels kinda good
i can't give you what you want
i know that we can not move on
something feels kinda special
so tell me why
( my love )
why can you give me now
( why can you give me now )
tell me why
why can you give me now
why can you give me now
tell me why
why can you give me now
why can you give me now
i'm done with sleepless nights
they are weak here by your side
save your mind , save your mind
got nothing left to fear
gonna tell you that you're here
he's not right , he's not right
i can't give you what you want
i know that we can not move on
something feels kinda special
tell me why
why can you give me now
why can you give me now
tell me why
why can you give me now
why can you give me now
something feels kinda special
something feels kinda good
tell me why
why can you give me now
why can you give me now
tell me why
why can you give me now
why can you give me now
tell me why
why can you give me now
why can you give me now
