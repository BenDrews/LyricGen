( seagulls , water , bells )
heaving breathing , panting
guess who's back , it ain't a fuckin' question
they know the name , bow in the presence of a living legend
fuck what you heard it's murder - murder , you gon' need protection
some niggas blinded , couldn't see , so look for me to come and give direction
who hold the crown , it ain't no conversation
iâ€™m being modest should be silent 'less you payin' homage
remain the hottest , niggas can't stop us , that's just being honest
and makin' hits , i never had problems much in that department
don't get me started , don't compare me to the newest nigga
for every one of you , there's a hundred more and i watch them come and go
my track record ain't coincidental
and these verses is like hearses consistently killin' all with instrumentals
tell me , fuck what would y'all do without me ? !
kill yourself for even thinking something crazy 'bout me
i'm like ali , your fuckin' champ , now watch me rope a dope
just watch him choke , cause everythin' i drop is dope , now watch 'em all go up in smoke
i came here to raise hell , i can't lie
one shot , one kill , it's real , i ain't hidin'
don't shoot one shot if you ain't ready to die
and never get it fucked up , i got shooters for hire
cause you don't want it , i have you like aye aye
better back the fuck up , over guns so i try
now that weak shit will never slide , i despise
you are now not in the presence of nice guys
look , what the fuck , i was just chillin' in the cut
ain't no beginners , only winners run amok , you runners up
you funny fuck like twenty bucks , i know your slut will let me fuck
i told my city " hold me down " , now look how high they hold me up
i'm kobe clutch , i hold my nuts 'fore i was old enough to cuss
was kissin' bitches after lunch , now that's a muthafuckin' rush
so by high school i was fuckin' niggas bitches on the hush
so no questions and no panties is a muthafuckin' must
it's the people's rapper , i ain't no rapper
i'm the rapture on the mornin' after
you lackin' passion , you ain't rap , you just a wack distraction
i can't relax cause i feel the magic smashin' , toni braxton
where your sisters at ? let's get it crackin'
look , i was young , i was broke
had no hope , so i wrote , that's how i cope
i went hard with no results
new approach , same truth
just get ready , aim , shoot , then get buried , bang , woof
so they better bring troops because...
i came here to raise hell , i can't lie
one shot , one kill , it's real , i ain't hidin'
don't shoot one shot if you ain't ready to die
and never get it fucked up , i got shooters for hire
cause you don't want it , i have you like aye aye
better back the fuck up , over guns so i try
i had weak shit , we'll never slide , i despise
you are now not in the presence of nice guys
it's fuckin' murder , baby
i'm tryna hurt 'em , baby
i know you heard me , baby
feel like i'm goin' crazy
it's fuckin' murder , baby
run , run , run , the cops almost got me
another tear drop , another motherfuckin' body
uh , uh , uh , another fuckin' body
uh , uh , uh , another body
uh , uh , uh , another body
uh , uh , uh , another body
uh , uh , uh , another fuckin' body , body
