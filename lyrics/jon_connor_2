yeah , alone with my thoughts
let me share it with you
they say the good die young , so the bad die old
guess we somewhere in the middle , so just pray for my soul
all i want to do is right , but all i'm seeing is wrong
and i'm trying to stay strong but its taking its toll
and i ain't no better than you so when you playing this song
and you feeling how i'm feeling , just know that you ain't alone
everyday you wake up , another day that it's on
so we got to wake up before what we seeing is gone
since the beggining , the mirror of what i've written
real has been my description , ain't never been nothing different
love me or hate me , just know its me you lovin' or hatin'
so there will never be an issue with what judgement your making
high school , i knew who i was , i had direction
a leader , i don't follow nobody , always progressing
so every girl in highschool a ho , was the perception
coz lame niggas lied on their dick , to get accepted
takin' a girls purity to get a sense of security
now she insecure , she get older and she ain't sure of me
and i ain't sayin' i'm an angel or saint
but one of these days i might need her to be wifey , but she can't
coz now she don't trust niggas , all the time fuck niggas
coz if she don't she thinking then no nigga gon' fuck with her
both male and female , lost in misdirection
it's a crazy world when you live in a misconception
she had the university trying to fit in , blowing intuition
was a good girl back at the crib , but now she different
blowin' trees , she was never into it
it's the influence of her roomy , she with it coz all her friends do it
back home she knew people , now she with these new people
she don't know herself no more , now she feeling like two people
niggas in the dorm , 3am , thinking they cool people
trying to keep up with this bullshit can consume people
talking loud , wrong crowd , ya'll fucking the same dudes
feeling like you can't move , this painful , this ain't you
you stay loose , cranberry juice and grey goose
can't shake ya head at them hoes , coz you doing what they do
niggas play you , too far gone , who gon' save you
funny how shit could have been , if you had stayed you
out of control on the path of misdirection
it's the crazy life when you live in misconception
the coolest nigga in high school , was exactly that
the coolest nigga in high school , time passed right by you
passing days of glory , keep telling them war stories
leaching off baby mommas , he never set his priorities
already finding , his best days is behind him
the hoes that he used to fuck , is what defines him
sleeping on different couches , got seeds in three different houses
but if you ask about him , he barely know nothing bout em'
i don't want him around me , all i know about him
is he broke and he brag about being in and out the county
and since when is not being shit , the shit ?
when there's only one life to live , i hope you listen huh ?
still alive , done living at twenty five
stuck in the hood , but never got out coz he never tried
look , check your brother , but check yourself first
the truth hurts , but we can all change after this verse
shit's real... it's too real
