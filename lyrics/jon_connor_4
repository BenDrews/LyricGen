who's back ? do you have to ask
fire , i'm the gas and match
i dance with the devil ; every track , i do the cabbage patch
i'm in the wrong habitat
a lion in a rabbit match
you the dude on the mat
getting elbowed in a randy savage match
imagine that - - you in a bandage wrap , y'all should have backed off
thought you was losing your mind , now your head getting hacked off
your baby momma wack - - you'd have been better if you'd have jacked off
now your kid like your car - - niggas asking , " how much did that cost ? "
never satisfied , i say my best line's my next line
i got sav and mo's phones blowing up like a request line
the same stage i rock'll be the one that i get killed on
that means i'll die in the blink of a eye
for what hip - hop was built on
a king , so watch the throne like this is kanye with a kilt on
feed off respect , i'm hungry - - that's the reason i keep going
the scary part about all this is that i'm still growing
planted a seed of doubt in niggas' minds , now it's a field growing
best in the world , you say i'm not
even though my shit is hot every time i drop ?
i just don't give a fuck
get on the blogs , leave comments hating on all of my songs ?
well , fuck y'all
i just don't give a fuck
they try to hate like they can't see that i'm great
well , go ahead and save face
i just don't give a fuck
cause i'm here to bring the pain
with my middle finger to the game cause
i just don't give a fuck
i don't give a fuck if you don't like me
what if i don't like you ?
i ain't ask your opinion on what beats you think i should write to
before i do , i'll be suicidal watching american idol
at my head with a rifle while i'm quoting the bible
this rap shit is draining me like lipo
going psycho cause half the time i can't remember what the fuck i write for
i ain't just good , i'm a god - - that's a typo
with jon connor , one thing you should believe is the hype , bro
this is the evolution , more like the execution
rappers got prices on they head like i'm selling humans
i'm just selling music , them niggas selling stupid
and y'all buy it ; it's confusing like a rubik's cube is
but i just move through it
i got my own agenda
i'm making dinner out contenders and i won't surrender
niggas make records about me that i don't remember
cause i'm too busy being me so fuck you , nigga
