until the day we touch the sky
most of my niggas getting high
i feel you like
most of my niggas getting high
we riding like
i guess i was the one that you could call naive
the world full of smoking mirrors
world full of broken mirrors
we hurtin' like open blisters
little brother that ain't know his sisters
world colder than the coldest winters
this world so backwards
we don't know our own potential
we could change the world
but then you say i'm in no position
sometime you just need an ear
but ain't nobody there to listen
so i can't just hold this pencil
and be like i don't know them niggas
that's like rationalizing with the killer
cause he ain't know his victims
passion that i just can't hide
hurts but it just ain't mine
knowing my neighborhood
ain't always looked that way outside
it's like they bored with us
elementary schools get boarded up
high schools getting boarded up
instead of warning us they ignoring us
i'm living my vision with my eyes closed
my dream , struggle ain't always what it seems
i tell my people to play this song
for the days that you can't take it
but always rest assured that you gone make it
but until then
when the sun comes up
and the moon goes down , i'll be around
with your head held down
you can't see the light of day
( most of my niggas gettin' high we riding like )
what up lost girl , trapped in this lost world
outside my window doesn't resemble what people have fought for
unprepared for this to be the song you skipped
cause we can all admit we call it quits
when we don't wanna hear we wrong as shit
little girl all of six , living room talking shit
mama told her shut her mouth
she turned around and called her bitch
laughter filled the room they think its cool until she twenty - two
dropped out of school
cause you ain't fixed the problem that's in front of you
fuckin' dudes having babies like it's a requirement
it ain't just her that's getting fucked its the whole environment
she intimate with dudes she tell 'em it don't feel right
and now she pregnant before she know what sex supposed to feel like
we turn our heads to lost young men like it's the usual
then talk about what we should have did at his funeral
ain't that a bitch , we hypocrites
guess with me it's hit or miss
we slaves to our own ignorance
my people feel this shit
see i done seen too many people go before their time
that's why i can't just write no bullshit in every line
i speak my mind because it's far too many of us dying
say it's too late to change the world but ain't nobody trying
and if i don't sell at least i'll die with a clear conscience
too scared to take a stand , ya'll just stand around watching
this shit i'm seeing on the tube and i just can't accept it
cause if i do my daughter will be 16 and pregnant
and i'm aware that words can be used as a weapon
you wanna see some ass than let me see some cash
think that shit ain't connected ?
this shit is hard without a question
but talk is cheap
so the least you could do is pay attention
in this recession
i'm not a conscious rapper
i'm a rapper with a conscience
and all i want is progress
if you could help me with this process
i'm just a human i'm just famous on the side
now let me see them hands in the sky
yeah , yeah , yeah
