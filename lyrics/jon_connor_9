when i was young , it seemed that life was so wonderful…
oh it was beautiful , magical…

rap was all i ever thought about , listened to , talked about
back before money was all they talked about , ( aw shit )
when i was young , the rappers could really rap , kid
now they more concerned about they ad - libs
listening to rappers like a student in a lecture
mimicking the cadences and practicing the gestures
eminem was rappin’ ’bout pills , so i popped those
swinging my shirt in the air like petey pablo
studied the greats from pun to 2pac
walked around my private school with my tapes in a shoe box
handed my music out to people i sold weed to
watching mtv , tellin’ myself “that’s gonna be you”
tapin’ the radio and puttin’ it on cassette
now i’m gettin’ bombs dropped on my shit by funk flex
it’s a trip , man – i just sit back and roll the purple
now watch this whole thing come around full circle
young nigga , influenced by the tv heavy
eatin’ little debbies’ , tuned into fab five freddy
vids i watched ‘em all , emulating applause
i ain’t fuck with superman , my super hero was biggie smalls
rappin’ with my dawgs proudly , nobody was cold as me
wishing somebody’d notice me
dreams to get a deal ’cause the speech so sick
now they talkin’ ’bout deals , and i’m like “keep that shit”
went through a lot of bs , lucky me
times had me like “this ain’t what it’s cracked up to be”
what’s good for the goose is good for the gander
it’s good for the blogs , it’s good for the slander
nowadays , they wishing it was how it was before
but that was back in the days when i was young
i’m not a kid anymore
the ogs that i listened to , i’m friends with
when i was younger , a nigga never would’ve thinked this
when i was younger nobody told us or showed us , crooked promoters
flint , michigan , general motors held the weight on our shoulders
until the shops started closing , felt like ain’t nobody want us
our parents worked to the bone , now they ain’t got a bone to throw us
now see how many kids is daydreaming about a label
yep , this rap shit is a bitch but the only one that was faithful
make it or die trying , at times it almost got fatal
my niggas was moving ‘caine and at times they was barely able
brothers killin’ brothers , shit goin’ on all around me
genesee county would ground me and teachers would try to clown me
‘cause i had heart that was bigger than my surroundings
i got flooded with hate , but no way i could let ‘em drown me
picture this one :
i used to go to sleep at night listening to “it was written”
then fastforward , nas is tellin’ me “nigga , you gifted”
if you fall , just shake it off
now they sayin’ it’s my time , but time just caught up with my thoughts
when i was young , it seemed that life was so wonderful…
oh it was beautiful , magical…
