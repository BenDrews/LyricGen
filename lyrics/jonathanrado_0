put your hand in mine it will entice you
put your hand in mine it will do the trick
put your hand in mine it will entice you
and you can cross me off your list
put your hand in mine it is a promise
put yours in mine forever more
put your hand in mine it will excite you
and you can cross me off your list
i won't leave you standing in the rain again
i won't leave you standing at all
so if you come right here
and if you hold me dear
i won't leave you standing in the rain
put your hand right here pretty baby
no you put yours away hold onto mine
why don't we hold each other little baby
cause then you'll cross me off your list
i am not a girl that you can step on
and i am not a man to lay right down
together we will be
together you will see
said you can cross us off your list
i won't leave you standing in the rain again
and i won't leave you standing at all
so if you come right here
and if you hold me dear
i won't leave you standing in the rain
so if you come right here , baby
if you hold me dear , baby
i won't leave you standing in the rain
