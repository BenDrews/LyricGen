when i walk around with my head to the ground
you seem to look down on tuesday
the faces i'll stare but i am prepared
to look into nobody's faces
you're seemingly dead and it's gone to your head
you feel like everyone's watching
you look into nobody's faces , faces , oh
what this world's about
call your friends and take them out
and travel to exotic places
you look into nobody's faces
when you take a stroll to escape the droll
of your mundane work place tuesday
breathe the fresh air , the flower in your hair
and look into nobody's faces
oh , you see a girl , the only one in the world
you faint from pure intoxication
well , as you come to you see them laughing at you
so just look into nobody's faces , faces , oh
what this world's about
you call your friends , take them out
and travel to exotic places
you look into nobody's faces
i look into nobody's faces
look into nobody's face
just look into nobody's faces
look into nobody's faces
yeah , look into nobody's faces
