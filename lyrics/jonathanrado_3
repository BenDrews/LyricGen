it's not a good day to live on the bay
the sky , it is ripe with rain
just wash it away
just wash it away
the ocean , devotion , and me
and i would buy an elephant for you
and you would buy an elephant for me
and we would live together in a tree
just you , the elephant , and me
i head someone say from far , far away
that an elephant's trunk would play
so trump it away
yes , trump it away
the ocean , commotion , and me
and i would buy a pelican for you
and you would buy a pelican for me
and we would catch our dinner from the sea
just you , the pelican , and me
and i would buy an elephant for you ( i would buy a pelican for you )
and you would buy an elephant for me ( you would buy a pelican for me )
and we would live together in a tree ( we would live together in the sea )
just you , the elephant , and me ( you , the pelican , and me )
just you , the elephant , and me ( just you , the pelican , and me )
just you , the elephant , and me ( just you , the pelican , and me )
just you , the elephant , and me ( just you , the pelican , and me )
just you , the elephant , and me ( just you , the pelican , and me )
just you , the elephant , and me ( just you , the pelican , and me )
just you , the elephant
