when i'm down i get real down
when i'm high i don't come down
but i get angry , baby , believe me

and i can leave you just as fast
but you don't judge me
'cause if you did , baby , i would judge you too

'cause if you did , baby , i would judge you too
'cause i got issues , but you got 'em too
so give 'em all to me and i'll give mine to you
bask in the glory , of all our problems
'cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
yeah , i got issues
and one of them is how bad i need you
you do shit on purpose
you get mad and you break things
feel bad , try to fix things
but you're perfect , poorly wired circuit
and got hands like an ocean
push you out , pull you back in
'cause you don't judge me

'cause you see it from the same point of view
'cause i got issues , but you got 'em too
so give 'em all to me and i'll give mine to you
bask in the glory , of all our problems
'cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
yeah , i got issues
and one of them is how bad i need you
