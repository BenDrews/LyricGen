daisy , always climbing up the same tree
finding love in all the wrong scenes , daisy , you got me
daisy , always walking down the wrong streets
starting fires out of dead weeds , daisy , you got me
let me show you how a kiss should taste
trust me , i won't give your heart away
why you running , running when you got it right here ?
oh , i would love you if you let me
daisy , always dancing to the same beat
broken record stuck on repeat , daisy , you got me
daisy , don't you know that you're amazing ?
broken hearts just keeps on breaking , daisy
and i would take the light out of the stars to help you see
anything to guide you straight to me
let me show you how a kiss should taste
trust me , i won't give your heart away
why you running , running when you got it right here ?
oh , i would love you if you let me
let me show you how a kiss should taste
trust me , i won't give your heart away
why you running , running when you got it right here ?
oh , i would love you if you let me
i won't give your heart away
why you running , running when you got it right here ?
