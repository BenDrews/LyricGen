lyrics will be available upon release. stay tuned !
last night was a bad one
screaming and fighting for nothing at all
last night was a hard one
pinning each other against the wall
we make each other small
i know we make each other fall
when we don't resolve what was said
how are we to just forget ?
when the night is ringing in our heads
how do we get back to love ?
