take me away , unravel everything
i wanna feel you breathe inside me
writhe with your fingers , all across my neck
if you feel what i feel , i'll guess it , just like that
stay with me , stay with me , stay with me
trip with me , trip with me , trip with me
am i really here , on the ceiling ?
way up here , somewhere , i am dancing
things keep falling , just like i do
well , am i really here , next to you ?
next to you ?
i picked so many petals and they all said the same
the last one in my hand had your name
so stay with me , stay with me , stay with me
trip with me , trip with me , trip with me
be with me , be with me , be with me
take me away , i wanna feel you breathe
am i really here , on the ceiling ?
way up here , somewhere , i am dancing
things keep falling , just like i do
am i really here , next to you ?
