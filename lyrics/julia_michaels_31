mr. arthur's place is set about a mile just off the interstate highway
and it's kinda hard to get to so you really gotta know where to go
and it's there you'll hear the music they played before the children were children
how the sound and the spirit sets you swinging as you step through the door
and they show you to a table , you have a drink or two
you ask her if she wants to dance , she says it's up to you
so you take her by the hand and you lead her to the edge of the dance floor
and she whispers to you , " honey i'm afraid my gown's a little too long "
you get into the rhythm and remember what it was that you came for
you forget the thirty years that have happened since they played you that song
and as you twirl around the room , you no longer feel a fool
it's just the way it used to be when she was your girl at school
slide with me , julia
i can lead if you will follow through
glide with me , julia
to see the simple pleasure we once knew
just to see the simple pleasure we once knew
you've had one terrific evening and you tell her as you drive down the highway
she says , " yes i really loved it and you know we gotta go there again "
but you get that empty feeling as you pull the car back into your driveway
you know exactly where you are but you're not too sure where you've been
as you turn out the bedroom light , you have a word or two
you ask her if she wants to sleep , she says it's up to you
slide with me , julia
i can lead if you will follow through
glide with me , julia
to see the simple pleasure we once knew
just to see the simple pleasure we once knew
