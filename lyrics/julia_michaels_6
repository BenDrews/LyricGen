like a kid and her teddy bear
like a leaf blowing in the air
could you carry me ?
could you carry me ?
like a flag after a war
when you're gone or when you're first born
could you carry me ?
could you carry me ?
cause i don't know how we
how we got so far , you and me
almost like there's oceans between us , us
so i need to know
could you carry me ?
back into your heart again
could you carry me ?
right into your distant hands
could you carry me ?
right back to where we started from
could you carry me ?
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on , could you carry me ?
back to where we started from
remember when we would dance all night
parking lots and velvet skies
i was there for you
and you were there for me
every time we would start a fight
we'd make love till the morning light
i was there for you
and you were there for me
so i don't know how we
how we got so far , you and me
almost like there's oceans between us , us
so i need to know
could you carry me ?
back into your heart again
could you carry me ?
right into your distant hands
could you carry me ?
right back to where we started from
could you carry me ?
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on , could you carry me ?
back to where we started from
on , on , on
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on , could you carry me ?
back to where we started from
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on and on , on , on , on
on and on , could you carry me ?
back to where we started from
