take your dark days and send them to the sun and carry on , carry on
to every lover who ever did you wrong , move along , move along
to every dream that drowned midstream and made you small inside
take your dark days and send them to the sun and carry on
let it go 'til you let go of all the anger
and all the words that made you hurt will burn like paper
straight into the fire , straight into the fire
and let it go until the smoke is gone forever
crack the windows and take the shutters down and carry on , carry on
take just one seed and put it in the ground and move along , move along
cause it's easy to hold on , but so hard to forgive
so take the dark days and send them to the sun and carry on
let it go 'til you let go of all the anger
and all the words that made you hurt will burn like paper
straight into the fire , straight into the fire
and let it go until the smoke is gone forever
straight into the fire
straight into the fire
straight into the fire
i will not rest until i see
the other side
i will not rest until i learn
to say goodbye
