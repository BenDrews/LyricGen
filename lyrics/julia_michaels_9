you say i don't have any time to try and keep you satisfied
i call you crazy all the time
you say i'm so damn difficult , and i save it with " you're beautiful "
you're tired of hearing the same lines
( so i cry , cry , and you don't know why , why )
so i wish i could trade hearts with you
so i can feel the same way you do , you do
hey can you teach me cynical ?
i hope it's not too difficult
don't tell me i'm incapable
cause i wanna scream the way you scream
i wanna bleed the way you bleed
but you only get half of me
( so you cry , oh yeah you cry , and i don't know why , baby , why )
so i wish i could trade hearts with you
so i can feel the same way you do
cause there's some things i just don't understand
like how hard a woman loves a man
so i wish i could trade hearts with you , with you
touch me 'til i feel your love all mine
touch me , love me , now like it's me that's cryin'
touch me 'til i feel your love all mine , oh
baby i swear that i'm tryin'
so i wish i could trade hearts with you
so i can feel the same way you do
cause there's some things i just don't understand
like how hard a woman loves a man
oh i wish i could trade hearts with you , with you
