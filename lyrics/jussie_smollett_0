grown men killing babies
who am i to say , you can make them nameless
another hashtag today , yeah
why should we care of that lady from somewhere , a far place
a covered face , tell me this
why are we back in the past ?
it's the same script , different cast
all of these alternative facts
catch me outside , how about that ?
why is it so hard to keep hope ?
who got that popular vote ?
was the whole thing just a joke ?
was the whole thing just one big joke ?
it's a fucked up world ( yes it is )
here we are in it
i ain't going nowhere
til' we're finished
it's a fucked up world
here we are in it
i ain't going nowhere
til' we're finished
drivin' me insane
we play a good game
baby we still can't win
let's cover the surface
try to be perfect
but look at the president
hurting me inside
cause it feels like we walk a million miles
losing momentum , losing , you win some
you better get it out now
it's a fucked up world ( yes it is )
here we are in it
i ain't going nowhere
til' we're finished
it's a fucked up world
here we are in it
i ain't going nowhere
til' we're finished
build a wall
it will keep us from loving each other
rewrite the laws
it won't keep us from loving each other
build a wall ( build a wall )
it will keep us from loving each other ( never gonna build a wall )
resist , resist , resist
resist , resist , resist
resist , resist , resist
resist , resist , resist
