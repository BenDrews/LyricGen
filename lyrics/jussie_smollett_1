up all night
oh , yeah
haven't felt your love for some time now
damn , i miss your lips next to my mouth
and i can't wait to make up for the lost time
'cause without you here
i'll probably never sleep
i look in the mirror
your face is all i see
i want you on my pillow
give me your love
i can't breathe
baby , come here
so i can go to sleep
you keep me up all night
whoa yeah
no shut eye
can't even sleep a wink at all
i can't lie
you've given me insomnia
now i can't wait to make up for the lost time
'cause without you here
i'll probably never sleep
i look in the mirror
your face is all i see
i want you on my pillow
give me your love
i can't breathe
baby , come here
so i can go to sleep
you keep me up all night
whoa oh
you keep me up all night
oh oh oh
you keep me up all night
