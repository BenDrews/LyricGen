empire state of mind. lets go
things are lookin' up , i'm ready for the night
i feel good , real good , can't nobody hold me down
gonna take advantage of all these flashin' lights
cause it's the best time the best time for it
we can do it all right now
can't nobody tie me down
if you want it , i got it
tomorrow's not promised
so live inside the moment
tell me , what are we waiting for ?
what the hell are waiting for ?
i wanna live inside the moment
tell me , what are we waiting for ?
what the hell are waiting for ?
i wanna live inside the moment , moment
moment
i wanna live inside the moment
i wanna live inside the moment
when i was five years old , i realized there was a road at the end
pretty girls , cars , and big rolls
gold and platinum plaques , a couple million sold
fans screamin' they love me , sellin' out my shows
i put in hard work
if you don't give your all then it won't work
gotta believe in yourself and gotta know your worth
i did it clean as a whistle , stayed away from dirt
i told you i'ma get it
everybody , they're talkin' , i dreamt about how i'm livin'
reality was written , i put effort in my vision
that's why i hustle so hard to be the best that ever did it
