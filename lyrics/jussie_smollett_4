it's like scarface and then some
crazy intense one
better back away bang , bang , bang , bang
daddy hit your note , do you a little hustle
when we rock the flow when on flip the script
gotta throw a little country in and whoop the trick
sometimes you only
get one try
( you gotta give it all you got )
'cause i ain't got nothing ( go get 'em ) to lose ( you hit 'em )
so much to prove
i get to far to hear no
( gotta go hard or go home )
'cause i ain't got nothing to lose
( baby , do what you gotta do )
feelin' like a pack of fleas
lookin' for a basset hound
maybe you should talk to steve
see if he can put us down
how the hell did my back get against the wall
( get your back up off the wall )
hell , no
at least i don't have to worry about the fall
( listen nizzle ain't the time to talk )
sometimes you only get one shot
( you gotta give it all you got )
'cause i ain't got nothing ( you better ) to lose ( go get 'em )
so much to prove ( let's go on )
i came too far to hear no
( gotta go hard or go home )
said i ain't got nothing to lose
to lose , to lose
oh god i'm britney
gotta do what you gotta do
hey , baby , now what did i just do ?
i'm hoping on you to come on through
hey , baby , got you love about you too
dormez - vous ?
i ain't got nothin' ( you're so crazy ) to lose ( lock stock barrel )
nothin' ( you're so shady ) to prove ( with a heart of gold )
you're so crazy
lock stock barrel
you're so shady
with a heart of gold
feelin' like a pack of fleas
lookin' for a basset hound
and he put us down
