my mouth is a weapon
i ain't scared of nothin'
they say he so reckless
bunkie's in the casket
better hit the exit , i'll eat you for breakfast
diamonds on my necklace , guess that's what i'm blessed with
i'm a revolutionary , pardon my vocabulary
i don't even 'member ever carin'
sue me when i'm in the cemetery
i'm legendary
i do what i want
and say what i want with no apologies
excuse me if i'm blunt
i say what i want with no apologies
and they won't shut me up , hell naw , hell naw
and they won't shut me up , hell naw , hell naw
i do what i want
and say what i want with no apologies
they get mad i keep on talkin'
never mind i beg your pardon
guess i'm just too damn outspoken
they can't take me anywhere
will i ever learn my lesson ?
try hard not to get arrested
guess i didn't get the message
f it , i don't really care
so much in my head , ohhh
( i would let 'em know )
it's so hard not to let go
( i'm about the dough )
the closer that you get , they try to hold you back
but a closed mouth don't get fed , no
( and can't nobody stop me , y'all )
i ain't goin' nowhere
( not even for obama , y'all )
i'm a loose cannon
i'm comin' for yah ( gunnin' for yah )
hope you're ready ( automatic )
ready , aim , fire , fire , legendary
i do what i want
and say what i want with no apologies
excuse me if i'm blunt
i say what i want with no apologies
and they won't shut me up , hell naw , hell naw
and they won't shut me up , hell naw , hell naw
i do what i want
and say what i want with no apologies
they can't be mad at me , look at my family
i guess it's all in my blood line
if you keep ridin' me for my apology
you'll be waitin' for a long time
not sympathetic , i said it , i meant it
you don't like it then i could care less
not sympathetic , i said it , i meant it
you don't like it then i could care less
i ain't sorry , i ain't sorry for nothin' i said
( one hand on the bible , i ain't in denial )
i ain't sorry , i ain't sorry for nothin' i said
( your honor , you can blame it on tiana )
