i've been living my life
but it isn't fair
woulda never thought i'd be
down in this gutter
if i can make it here
i can make it anywhere
when the going gets tough
i've gotta get tougher
sometimes you only get one shot
i've gotta give it all i got
cause i ain't got nothing to lose
so much to prove
i get to far to hear no
gotta go hard or go home
i ain't got nothing to lose
i gotta do what i gotta do
( i ain't got nothing )
oh , how the hell did my back
get against the wall
never thought that i would
be here at rock bottom , oh oh
at least i don't have to worry
about the phone
why did i end up with 99 problems
sometimes you only get one shot
i've gotta give it all i got
cause i ain't got nothing to lose ( i ain't got nothing )
so much to prove ( i got so much to prove to you )
oh god i'm pregnant
i get to far to hear no
gotta go hard or go home
i ain't got nothing to lose
i gotta do what i gotta do ( oh , i ain't got nothing )
