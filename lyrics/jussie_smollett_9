can hold a gun
and hold your heart
can put out fires
and make 'em start
skin and bones
and flesh and blood
with all this nerve
how did we get this numb
cus they can hurt
or they can heal
they can give back
or they can steal
they can break the world
or they can change it too
ooh hands
hands
woooo hands
oh hands
cause they can love
or they can take
they can fight up
until they save
they can break the world
they can change it too
ooh hands
doesn't matter
who you love
all that matters
is your love
i've been watching news
and seeing all this hate
tell me is it wrong
to want a little change
they can hurt
or they can heal
they can give back
or they can steal
they can break the world
or they can change it too
ooh hands

cause they can love
or they can take
