i'll never forget the first time i realized
that the darkness in me can be lightnin' in the night
shooting fire 'cross the sky , burnin' out
and changin' lives , yeah they can try , i'll never die
i'll never forget the first time i saw the truth
that the power in me , it shines brighter than the moon
every dream that i see , it becomes reality
yeah they can try , i'll never die
feel this forever , let it carry on
forever , forever , forever
feel this forever , even when you're gone
forever , forever , forever , ever , ever
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh , forever
i'm lost in the rush , that keeps rushin' through my veins
oh who needs love , who needs love
when the people scream your name
i'm the one , only one who can save us from all the pain
yeah , they can try , i'll never die
feel this forever , let it carry on
forever , forever , forever
feel this forever , even when you're gone
forever , forever , forever
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh , forever
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh , forever
the future brings , champion rings , on every finger
you gotta take some time to let the gold just linger
going gold , yeah solid gold , no time for silver
look in these eyes , these stealing eyes , and watch them shimmer
the purple haze fill up the days , awards the feelin'
walls of stone , they came to home of new beginnings
the moment's now , the broken place , we're dreamin' bigger
the future brings , champion rings , on every finger
feel this forever , let it carry on
forever , forever , forever
feel this forever , even when you're gone
forever , forever , forever
feel this forever , let it carry on
forever , forever , forever
feel this forever , even when you're gone
forever , forever , forever
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh , forever
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh , forever
