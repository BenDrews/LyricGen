i discover broken dreams
fix themselves when you're with me
new dimensions open up
insanity can't get enough
i won't lie , i won't lie , i won't lie , i won't lie to you
i lose my mind
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
i won't lie , i won't lie , i won't lie , i won't lie to you
i lose my mind
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
tied to you
tied to you
tied to you
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
tied to you
tied to you
tied to you
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
so electric , let it slide
inner visions by your side
i don't change on my face
but in my bones , im bendin' space
lovin' rush tidal wave
not making sense , but let me say
i won't lie , i won't lie , i won't lie , i won't lie to you
i lose my mind
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
i won't lie , i won't lie , i won't lie , i won't lie to you
i lose my mind
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
tied to you
tied to you
tied to you
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
tied to you
tied to you
tied to you
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
i lose my mind
i lose my mind
1 , 2 , 3 , 4
i won't lie , i won't lie , i won't lie , i won't lie to you
i lose my mind
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
i won't lie , i won't lie , i won't lie , i won't lie to you
i lose my mind
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
tied to you
tied to you
tied to you
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
tied to you
tied to you
tied to you
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
every time , every time , my tongue gets tied to you
