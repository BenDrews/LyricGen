i can tell this isn't gonna end well
but it's what i want , so i can't stop
i can tell this isn't gonna end well
but makin' love when we're mad's too fun
i can tell
i'll tell ya how it's gonna end
it isn't gonna be as friends
it's gonna be an all out brawl , shout
scratch , claw , get yer guns out
shoot 'til it runs out
fight 'til you bleed out
oh i know it too well
the look and the smell of trouble , oh well
i know we'll excel at crappy motels
so click your seatbelt and brace yourself
here we go jezebel
a smarter man would leave it well enough alone
i know better but i don't
and you know i know you know
i can tell this isn't gonna end well
but it's what i want , so i can't stop
i can tell this isn't gonna end well
but makin' love when we're mad's too fun
i can tell..
this isn't gonna end well
he said it isn't gonna end well
well , i don't give a fuck
'cause i can tell , well , we're shit out of luck
but that don't mean we can't fuck
can't love , can't , 'cause we're never gonna last
but nothin' really does
i'm glad to catch a buzz from fresh blood
feels like flower in the bud
but everybody knows every rose has a thorn
that grows from a poison
never had a choice , and never disappointed
i can tell we're gonna fail
we're gonna crash and burn and i should bail
but like a gory horror movie or a foreign beauty
i can't look away , it's fuckin' stupid
prob'ly i just like the drama , comma
got some karma comin' , comma
like the pain or somethin' , comma
head trauma , marijuana , blame obama if ya wanna
i just wanna get up on ya
a smarter man would leave it well enough alone
i know better but i don't
and you know i know you know
i can tell..
this isn't gonna end well
i can tell..
this isn't gonna end well
yo i hate you
no i love you
no , i hate it that i love you
i'm addicted to the trouble
the dirt and the ruble
but i don't want a shovel
get straight to the point
i ain't much for bein' subtle
at times i don't like you , we argue
fight too , can't live without you
but i ain't tryin' to wife you
creep on each other like the snakes and the mice move
stab the other half in the heart like a knife do
even though this'll never last
when this gun is out of bullets we can say we had a blast
speedin' in the fast lane 'til we runnin' out of gas
won't end until they pullin' both bodies out the crash
this was an epic fail
it's all goin' to hell
but when we get there meet me at the stairwell
fuck until your heart breaks
we can get a hotel
fuck until your heart breaks
we can get a hotel
i can tell this isn't gonna end well
but it's what i want , so i can't stop
i can tell this isn't gonna end well
but makin' love when we're mad's too fun
i can tell..
this isn't gonna end well
