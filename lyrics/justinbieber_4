don't do it to me , don't do it to me , oh no no , oh no no
don't do it to me , oh no no , oh no no

focused , i'm focused
she got a body like that , i ain't never seen nothing like that
like a fantasy in front of me
i think that something special is going down
that's right i think she foreign , i think she foreign
got passports , mi amor started slow , got faster
she gon' work some more , work some more
no stopping her now , no stopping her now
then she started dancing , sexual romancing
nasty but she fancy , lipstick on my satin sheets
what's your nationality ? i wonder if there's more of you
she's got my attention , she's confident
oh no no , oh no no , she's confident
oh no no , oh no no and i'm down with it
oh no no , oh no no , she's confident
you could tell by the way she walks in the room
she said it's her first time , i think she might have lied
feels so good damn and i don't know why
i'm addicted , something like an addict
got me twisted , but still i gotta have it
explosive , explosive
i could still smell her perfume
it's not hard to notice , that i'm open
hypnotised by the way she moves
then she started dancing , sexual romancing
nasty but she fancy , mona lisa masterpiece
what's your nationality ? i wonder if there's more of you
she's got my attention , she's confident
oh no no , oh no no , she's confident
oh no no , oh no no and i'm down with it
oh no no , oh no no , she's confident
you could tell by the way she walks in the room
she said it's her first time , i think she might have lied
feels so good damn , and i don't know why
i'm addicted , something like an addict
got me twisted , but still i gotta have it
( chance , the rapper ? )
tattoos , piercings and she just learned to twerk
she ain't got a heart or a ass , just her brains
gotta ask cause her ass on a learning curve
and she love to hurn the berb , i mean burn the word
that's only legal with a doctor's note
real deep pockets like a doctor's coat
stay faded like diddy's hair , back tryna rock the vote
she the first mate when i rock the boat
she never forget to ride like a bicycle
she like planes , trains , chains with icicles
it goes her , blank , blank , and rock & roll
she say " i know , honey bunny
that's the funny thing "
thots twerk for the goodfellas
she money dance with the money team
igh !
she's confident
oh no no , oh no no , she's confident
oh no no , oh no no and i'm down with it
oh no no , oh no no , she's confident
you could tell by the way she walks in the room
she said it's her first time , i think she might have lied
feels so good damn , and i don't know why
i'm addicted , something like an addict
got me twisted , but still i gotta have it
still i gotta have it , still i gotta have it , still i gotta have it
oh no no , oh no no , oh no no
oh no no , oh no no , oh no no
oh no no , oh no no , oh no no
but still i gotta have it
