mark my words , that's all that i have
mark my words , give you all i got
in every way i will
you're the only reason why
oh i don't wanna live a lie
mark my words
mark my words
so you heard it all before
falling in and out of trust
trying to rekindle us
only to lose yourself
but i won't let me lose you
and i won't let us just fade away
after all that we've been through
i'ma show you more than i ever could say
mark my words , that's all that i have
mark my words , give you all i got
in every way i will
you're the only reason why
oh i don't wanna live a lie
mark my words
mark my words
