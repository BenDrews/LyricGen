you come and go and you'll stay as you please
convinced a moment's time is all that i need
these temporary highs can't make me believe
that your feelings are true
holding out your hand
while you turn your head
i don't want half of your love
empty words you've said
bare unraveled thread
you know it's never enough
you can't love me this way
you can't keep me in chains
you can't lead me astray
from an arm's length away
you search for breathing space while i'm undersea
tell me to wait so you can sort through your needs
keep leaving trails that you’ll follow to me
i can't let you get through
holding out your hand
while you turn your head
i don't want half of your love
empty words you’ve said
bare unraveled thread
you know it’s never enough
you can't love me this way
you can't keep me in chains
you can't lead me astray
from an arm's length away
your absence won't define me now
held up my end with breath i've found
surrendered time to solid ground , solid ground
you can't love me this way
you can't keep me in chains
you can't lead me astray
from an arm's length away
you can't love me this way
you can't keep me in chains
you can't lead me astray
from an arm's length away
you can't love me this way
you can't keep me in chains
