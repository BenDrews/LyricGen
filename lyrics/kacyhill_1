cue the soft recordings
float through dreams instilled
be a soft kind of prison
jail thoughts unfulfilled
drink a soft kind of prison
jail thoughts unfulfilled
breathe a soft kind of prison
jail thoughts unfulfilled
freedom , a state of mind
sold to wandering eyes
substances controlled
to protect the mind
substances controlled
to protect the mind
substances controlled

substances controlled
to protect the mind
substances controlled
to protect the mind
world it offers itself to unravel every inch
sower upon each instinct experience so real
hypnotist of success
love fulfills the rest
become the earth
skin covered in dirt
become the earth
skin covered in dirt
become the earth
skin covered in dirt
skin covered in dirt
skin covered in dirt
skin covered in dirt
covered in dirt , covered in dirt
language a nasty wall
body feels it all
lust rules the water sourcing each breath , each fall
