when will we fall ?
silence over us all
seek peace in chains
rapt in exchange
somewhere farther we both know
take me higher than you’ll go
stuck in feeling something real
skeptic to a new ideal
motion to foreign fields
motion to foreign fields
motion to foreign fields
foreign fields
lost in our mood
afraid to feel truth
succumb to your youth
melt into seclude
velvet touch to swollen brace
languorous movements we both make
lithe perception , who’s to blame ?
osculate until we break
motion to foreign fields
motion to foreign fields
motion to foreign fields
foreign fields
motion to foreign fields
motion to foreign fields
motion to foreign fields
foreign fields
how did we get
how did we get here ?
how did we get
how did we get here ?
how did we get
how did we get here ?
how did we get
how did we get here ?
motion to foreign fields
motion to foreign fields
motion to foreign fields
foreign fields
motion to foreign fields
motion to foreign fields
motion to foreign fields
foreign fields
motion to foreign fields ( i know we can )
