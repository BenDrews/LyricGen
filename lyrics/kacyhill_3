i should have known this time
that you couldn't hold me right
if you've got the moon you don't need my light
what am i to you ?
i've covered up these signs
that tangle in words and wine
when your world comes through
iâ€™ll be left in mine
what am i to you ?
i don't wanna raise white flags up high
when all i can breathe are shades of blue
i can't keep surrendering my time
when you're feeding me these shades of blue
you said these things take time
but silence gives quick replies
is there any truth
in loving your high
or have i been used ?
i don't wanna raise white flags up high
when all i can breathe are shades of blue
i can't keep surrendering my time
when you're feeding me these shades of blue
wasted my days in the chase
while you kept me at reach
hoping you'd change all your ways
and you'd pull me out the blue
i don't wanna raise white flags up high
when all i can breathe are shades of blue
i can't keep surrendering my time
when you're feeding me these shades of blue
