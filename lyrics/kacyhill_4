tell me why you'd want my love when i give you none ?
both your eyes are on my heart after all i've done
but i did what i did and it's alright
to tell me that you think it's not right
but you woke the lion , oh
the lion , oh
you woke the lion , oh
you wanted fire , oh
now i'm alight , oh
you woke the lion , oh
told you twice you'd change your mind
once you knew what it's like
held your pride like all those times
i let go of mine
but i did what i did and its alright
if you play the victim one more time
but you woke the lion , oh
the lion , oh
you woke the lion , oh
you wanted fire , oh
now i'm alight , oh
you woke the lion , oh
so here we are , i'm in your arms
one more time
say what you will , another kill
with those eyes
but you woke the lion , oh
the lion , oh
you woke the lion , oh
you wanted fire , oh
now i'm alight , oh
you woke the lion , oh
