trust is all that i need from you
enough , to restore my faith in you
lights , break when you need them to
'cause your flaws are never your own to use
and you whisper replies that hovers so weightless
string all their lies between our faces , now
and you make it hard to love
you make it hard to...
tell me , nothing has changed
that words still hold all the same
and you , you make it hard to love
you make it hard to
darling , promises filled
you're holding onto their failure now
'cause you make it hard to love
you make it hard to love
speak , only what pleases you
bring into me a weak excuse
clutched to slivers of golden fumes
'cause your lies have become nostalgia's news
and you whisper replies that hovers so weightless
string all their lies between our faces , now
'cause you make it hard to love
you make it hard to...
tell me , nothing has changed
that words still hold all the same
and you , you make it hard to love
you make it hard to
darling , promises filled
you're holding onto their failure now
'cause you make it hard to love
you make it hard to love
you make it hard to love
you make it hard to love
i forgot how your world could make me feel weightless
now you just pull me down from my graces
'cause you make it hard to love
you make it hard to love
'cause you make it hard...
tell me , nothing has changed
that words still hold all the same
and you , you make it hard to love
you make it hard to
'cause you make it hard to love
darling , promises filled
you're holding onto their failure now
you make it hard to love
you make it hard to love
'cause you make it hard to love
