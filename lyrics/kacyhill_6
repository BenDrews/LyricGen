when will we fall ?
silence over us all
seen peace , in chains
locked in , exchange
somewhere further , we both know
take me higher than you'll go
stuck in feeling something real
skeptic to a new ideal
motion into foreign fields
motion into foreign fields
motion into foreign fields
foreign fields
motion into foreign fields
motion into foreign fields
motion into foreign fields
foreign fields
motion into foreign fields
motion into foreign fields
motion into foreign fields
foreign fields
motion into foreign fields
motion into foreign fields
motion into foreign fields
foreign fields
how did we get
how did we get here ?
how did we get
how did we get here ?
how did we get
how did we get here ?
how did we get
how did we get here ?
motion into foreign fields
