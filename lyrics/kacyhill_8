heart was in an empty space
but falling in love never gave me grace
spendin' all my time away
better to want you in retrograde
and how do you love ?
how do you love ?
how do you love ?
how do you love ?
what makes you make me feel like a woman ?
i'm sayin' things that i thought that i wouldn't
and now you cut me , remind me of my beatin' heart
i'll be your venus if you were my mars , yeah
what makes you make me feel like a woman ?
speak to me incredibly
unfolding my arms until i'm in the deep
you bury me shamelessly
and leave me to want inescapably
and how do you love ?
how do you love ?
how do you love ?
how do you love ?
what makes you make me feel like a woman ?
i'm sayin' things that i thought that i wouldn't
and now you cut me , remind me of my beatin' heart
i'll be your venus if you were my mars , yeah
what makes you make me feel like a woman ? oh
what makes you make me feel like a woman ?
i'm sayin' things that i thought that i wouldn't
and now you cut me , remind me of my beatin' heart
i'll be your venus if you were my mars , yeah
what makes you make me feel like a woman ? oh
