i don't want to be your cigarette
i don't want to be your ashtray
i don't want to be your door mat
don't want to be ignored
all o' sudden you're not into me
and maybe it's not deliberate
and i know you never asked me
i just gotta put it out there
i don't put myself out there
usually i stay tucked away
cause i was a loner until i met you
and i let you in after all the persuasion
mind games , manipulations
that's why i'd rather be a loner
yeah i'd rather be alone
i don't even want to know ya
i don't want to be known
cause i'd rather be a loner
i'd much rather be alone
baby it was nice to know ya
packing up and leaving home
no i don't want to be your cigarette
use me up then toss me , step on me
i don't want to be an option
avoidin' interaction cause
i just want to get away
and maybe you got a full plate
know i'm cookin' something better
but if you don't want me now
no boy i don't want you later
don't try to come and eat with me
cause i was a loner until i met you
and i let you in after all the persuasion
headaches and allegations
