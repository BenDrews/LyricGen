i don't gotta hide , no , i don't got reason to lie
i don't need your drama , i don't need you to survive
you don't gotta say it cause i know that you don't like me
you and all your friends can open wide , go on and bite me
i know i'm some shit and i'm cool with it
you can't tell me shit , don't come and share your dialect
ridin' 'round your city like the cops now
cause there's no way that we're gonna stop now
ridin' 'round and my car's low
( what you waitin' for ? )

i know it sounds strange , but i used to count change
on the counter at the grocery store , the bags i would arrange
now his face is looking kinda flustered
he didn't know that i was my own hustler
baby , understand , i don't need a man
fuck me over , i'll fuck you worse then take off to japan
think that i couldn't cross the street without holdin' his hand
and that if he did his dirt he'd get off with a reprimand
oh no , oh no , oh no
oh my , oh my , oh my
now we're ridin' 'round your city with the top down
ridin' 'round your city like the cops now
oh no , oh no , oh no
oh my , oh my , oh my
ridin' 'round your city with the top down
cause my passenger is pretty , we won't stop now
