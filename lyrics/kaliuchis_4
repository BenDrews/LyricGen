if i told you i was yours
you'd probably label me a " bore "
maybe i'm just trying way too hard to keep you
you're an angel and i'm blessed
so i am trying to do my best
want you to know how very nice it was to meet you
so much time i spend to find
something that i could call mine
something real out of all these phony people
and i know our past is tainted
it's a shame , now , baby ain't it ?
but i'm willing if you're willing
i'll be see through
can you take this chance on me ?
( you won't regret it , come on and get it )
love is like the lottery
( yeah , we had issues , can we dismiss those ? )
can you take this chance on me ?
( you won't regret it , come on and get it )
you're the only one i see
yeah , we had issues , can we dismiss those ?
if to you i am indebted
don't expect you to forget it
but it's only gonna stop us if we let it
yeah , it hit me like a gunshot
and from then till my burial plot
i'mma roll these dice until i hit the jackpot
baby , i know i learned my lesson
love was never my profession
i'm just learning as we're growing
and progressing
no , i never meant to hurt you
it's myself , i didn't virtue
now my mind is ready to give our love nurture
can you take this chance on me ?
( you won't regret it , come on and get it )
love is like the lottery
( yeah , we had issues , can we dismiss those ? )
can you take this chance on me ?
( you won't regret it , come on and get it )
you're the only one i see
yeah we had issues , can we dismiss those ?
