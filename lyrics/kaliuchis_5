you are my church , you are my place of worship
i heard you're the plug , can i be the circuit ?
when i got court , i hope that you're the verdict
when you're around , my insides turn inverted
my blood start to rush when i see you , doorman
i know you're nearby and i know your purpose
take one look at you , you're heaven's incarnate
what is this spell , baby ? please show some mercy
melting like an ice cream
when you smile
melting , you're a daydream
stay a while
i pray that i can learn to be funny
i'm watching every stand - up comedy
just hoping that it will rub off on me
so you'll smile at everything i say
you got some soft lips and some pearly whites
i wanna touch them in the dead of night
your smile ignites just like a candlelight
then somehow i know everything's alright
melting like an ice cream
when you smile
melting , you're a daydream
stay a while
melting like an ice cream
when you smile
melting , you're a daydream
stay a while
