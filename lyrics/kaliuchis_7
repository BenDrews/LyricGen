you don't really know what you got yourself into
boy , you think you know , but it just ain't that simple
i don't got the time , you should
read between the lines , cause you're
skimming through the pages , it's
really looking dangerous
when i'm driving in your car
make me feel like i could do anything
but i do not have the drive
i'm in desperate need of your speed
of your speed , of your speed , of your speed
baby i can feel it coming , tell me , is it coming true ?
maybe it was going perfectly the way you planned it to
lately i been thinking all i really wanna do is go
faster , can we go faster
something in the air , i really just don't wanna take it slow
if we waste the time , i think it might just make me miserable
lately i been thinking all i really wanna do is go
faster , can we go faster
you better hit your brakes
'fore you crash , boy , crash
when i'm driving in your car , make me feel like i could do anything
but i do not have the drive , i'm in desperate need of your speed
of your speed , of your speed , of your speed
you better hit your breaks
'fore you crash , boy , crash
