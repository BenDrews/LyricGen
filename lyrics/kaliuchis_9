i was wondering , why you've been acting weird lately
can you please pick up your phone ?
i don't know , i don't know why you're not answering
i know you won't talk to me or anything
but , just think about this
there's only one girl for me
come on , baby you know it
there's only one girl for me
come on , baby you know it
there's only one girl for me , one girl for me
there's only one girl for me , one girl for me
just give me one last chance i promise that i won't blow it
time and time again i said i would leave you alone
stop picking up on the phone
knock knock on my door , no one's home
if you want me to be yours , you got to make it known
imma make you work for it like you're on commission
want to take me out , you better ask permission
tell them other bitches just to mind their business
i ain't no competition
there's only one girl for me
come on , baby you know it
there's only one girl for me
come on , baby you know it ( you're the only one for me )
there's only one girl for me , one girl for me
there's only one girl for me , one girl for me
just give me one last chance i promise that i won't blow it
don't take it personal , but i don't want to hear it
yes your words are pretty , the delivery's coherent
but talk is cheap , and see i've got expensive taste
better hope that i don't catch you lying to my face
actions speak louder than words
go and show me what i've heard
if you don't know , you're gonna learn
just what i deserve
there's only one girl for me
come on , baby you know it
there's only one girl for me
come on , baby you know it ( you're the only one for me )
there's only one girl for me , one girl for me
there's only one girl for me , one girl for me
just give me one last chance i promise that i won't blow it
i'm not that jaded baby , lately i'm just misunderstood
stood by your window 'till the morning rose , morning wood good
had been forever if i didn't do whatever it was
that broke the straw on top the camel's back , get over the hump
it's what i tell myself to tell you but i'm pressing my luck
don't mean to press your buttons
shouldn't have unbuttoned the jeans
i'd make it worse if i admit it didn't mean anything
or maybe it's just a dream
but let me tell you one thing
there's only one girl for me
come on , baby you know it
there's only one girl for me
come on , baby you know it ( you're the only one for me )
there's only one girl for me , one girl for me
there's only one girl for me , one girl for me
just give me one last chance i promise that i won't blow it ( yeah , you best not blow your chance )
alright baby , i don't know what you think i was doing
but , who's going to treat you better than me ?
let's just be honest here...
i heard you talking to somebody
but shit , what's really going on ?
but anyway , just give me a chance
i just want to come back to you
