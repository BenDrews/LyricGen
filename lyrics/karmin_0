i'm jubilant with a stupid grin
which screw's loose ? where do you begin ?
i call my dude and i tell him what room i'm in
then moon him from the window of the looney bin
he's fuming , cause i'm really being rude again
i ruin my connection to my human kin
and so i'm movin' into the kennel
settle down with the goof troop
snoop , and it's juice and gin
took my tylenol , and took a violent fall
when i tried to crawl , up the asylum wall
watsky sippin' carlo rossi
all the foxy ladies , i can drunk dial 'em all
because i can be in seventeen places at once
while seventeen me's puff a hundred seventy blunts
and while i'm chiefin' in dc with eric holder
i'm sharing marijuana with the mayor of boulder
colorado , but the air is colder
when i'm in the south pole , where the bears are polar
i crap on the critics who deny my place
then wipe my ass with the fabric of time and space
no flex zone , no flex zone
they know better , they know better
no flex zone , no flex zone
they know better , they know better
i know , the city , it be full of crap
plastic pretty women , hear my knuckles crack
out on hollywood boulevard poppin' those silicone humps
like it was a roll of bubble wrap
i keep my fingernails sharp , and my mind too
if the dog's gonna bark , then i'll find you
but if you scratchin' on the bark of the wrong tree
and i reach you then i'll eat you , i'm hungry
cause i don't care if you're a sex machine
little man , move along to the next vagine
i can slide up in the west and i bless the scene , the queen
here to flex on the next regime , my team
is impeccable , wrecking every consecutive sucker
that wanna step up and knock us off of the pedestal
you're pitiful , lookin' just like the next goon
put 'em all on a rocket to neptune
no flex zone , no flex zone
they know better , they know better
no flex zone , no flex zone
they know better , they know better
you roll up to attend our bash
and you get whiplash like a ten car crash
with kim kardashian's ass , get a flash
out the passenger side of the jaguar's dash
i come through late like dre with detox
if these elite jocks , i'll say we're ewoks
chumps with weak hops , pull up your knee socks
then pump your reeboks , then jump the tree tops
skintone fair , syndrome rare
the peasant is unpleasant but the king don't care
let them all call , let my ringtone blare
while the beat bump , bump like a ingrown hair
bump , bump like a ingrown , bump like a ingrown
bump , bump , bump like a ingrown hair
cut through the jungle in the middle of nowhere
i'm steady with my machete , i'm ready to go there
i be rubbin' my nipples , givin' the public a sample
of my ridiculous , ample , jiggly , bubbly personality
hit 'em with the fatality , lickety - split
a lot of petty people , they don't get the simplest shit
they don't mean diddly squat , do they ? now riddle me that
we be the pitbulls , nibble on these kittens and cats
eat 'em like kibbles 'n bits , leavin' them stiff on their back
give them a wag of the finger , never a tip of the cap
we be the pick of the litter , keepin' it mentally locked
i got a lot of opinions , more than a centipede's socks
and i open up the door when my enemy knocks
they're gonna be checkin' me , then they're gonna be in the penalty box
lookin' a bit like a hockey player with a messed up enamel
and i be clickin' the button for the discovery channel
until i'm kickin' the bucket , so kiss my butt , i'm an animal
and i get more hump than a couple of camels
