used to be your baby , used to be your lady

i met the perfect guy
he had that colgate smile ,
he had that suit and tie
mama always said get a rich boyfriend
you don’t gotta love ‘em , girl , you can pretend
you bet i totes believed her , yeah , every word she said
thought he was gluten - free , but all that i got was bread
mama always said nice guys finish last
beat ‘em at his own game , honey , take the cash
ooo , and what a lucky girl you will be
but no , he didn’t do jack for me
i want a bean with a beanstalk
and if the magic ain’t right , time to walk
used to be your baby , used to be your lady
thought you were the perfect lover
all the harmony went falling out of key , so
now you gotta find another , yeah

out on our first date , he took me gourmet
we hit that olive garden , my little italy
daddy always said ( let the gentleman pay
never ever go dutch at the buffet )
i saw his bad intention , he didn’t wanna talk
he put the saucy on it ( oops ! ) time to check my watch
daddy always said ( money can’t buy class
you don’t wanna get stuck taking out trash )
ooo , yeah i guess it wasn’t meant to be
because he didn't do jack for me
i want a bean with a beanstalk
and if the magic ain’t right , time to walk
used to be your baby , used to be your lady
thought you were the perfect lover
all the harmony went falling out of key , so
