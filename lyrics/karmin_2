this is more than the typical kinda thing
felt a jones in my bones when you were touching me
uh - oh , didn’t wanna take it slow
in a daze , goin' craze , i can barely think
you’re replayin' in my brain , find it hard to sleep
uh - oh , waitin' for my phone to blow
uh - oh , yup
now i’m here in a sticky situation
got a bit of trouble , yup , and now i’m pacin'
five minutes , ten minutes , now it’s been an hour
i don’t wanna think too hard , but i’m sour
uh - oh , i can’t seem to let you go
see i’ve been waiting all day for you to call me , baby
so let’s get up , let’s get on it
don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
come on , that’s right
honest , baby , i’ll do anything you want to
so can we finish what we started ?
don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
come on , that’s right , cheerio !
what’s the time ? such a crime , not a single word
sippin' on that patrón , just to calm my nerves
uh - oh , poppin’ bottles by the phone , oh yeah
had me up , had me down , turned me inside out
that’s enough , call me up , baby , i’m in doubt
uh - oh , and i don’t even think you know
no , no , no !
see i’ve been waiting all day for you to call me , baby
so let’s get up , let’s get on it

so can we finish what we started ?
don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
come on , that’s right , cheerio !
ay , anything you wanna do , i’ll be on it too
everything you said , is like gold with a view
business in the front , party in the back
maybe i was wrong , was the outfit really wack ?
this kinda thing doesn’t happen usually
i’m on the opposite side of it , truthfully
i know you want it , so come and get it
cheerio
