you said i had it all
you said it took no brains
you promised all the stars
and then you took the reins
i watched it all come down
you set my dreams ablaze
i saw the meteor
coming from far away
every word you say is made to please
oh , i better watch out
everyone's got faces no one sees
well , i guess i didn't know you at all , hey
no , no , i guess i didn't know you at all , hey
oh , before we fly we have to fall
i guess i didn't know you at all
i made it out alive
a couple bruises fade
and so i cover up
and wear a smiley face
i had to sell my car
and gather up my things
i heard you're on to the next
so they can kiss your rings
everyone's got faces no one sees
oh , they better watch out
every word you say is made to please
well , i guess i didn't know you at all , hey
no , no , i guess i didn't know you at all , hey
oh , before we fly we have to fall
i guess i didn't know you at all
like a bird of the prey
out of nowhere you came
do you always get your way ?
like a bird of the prey
out of nowhere you came
do you always , do you always get your way ?
every word you say is made to please
i better watch out
everyone's got faces no one sees
i guess i didn't know you at all , hey
no , no , i guess i didn't know you at all , hey
oh , before we fly we have to fall
i guess i didn't know you at all
no , no , i guess i didn't know you at all
( like a bird of the prey )
i guess i didn't know you at all
( out of nowhere you came )
before we fly we have to fall
i guess i didn't know you at all
( do you always get your way ? )
like a bird of the prey
out of nowhere you came
do you always get your way ?
like a bird of the prey
out of nowhere you came
do you always , do you always get your way ?
