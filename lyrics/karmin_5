ay , ay , ay
is it time ? green light
egotistic battle cry
i was right , you was wrong
called you out , finished strong
whiskey sour lemonade
fences up my barricade
i had heart , you had spades
i could see the color in your face as it fades
and that's how it is , ain't no riddle
crunchy on the edge but soft in the middle
i got a lot , you got a little
i'mma play war drums , you play the fiddle
play it real slow , lean on the bow
everybody sad when they miss a free throw
lost your control , i'm on a roll
right all along and i knew it in my soul
i told you so
don't wanna brag , but you already know , oh - oh
i told you so
don't wanna brag , but you already know
you already know
i told you , i told you
i told you so , oh
i told you , i told you
i told you so
fa - fa - fa
feels so good , doesn't it ?
winnin' while they flubbin' it
i was right , you was wrong
figured i'd write it in a hip hop song
was it so hard to believe
i can make it being me ?
drank too much ouzo
my gosh , you know
people say a lot of things , make you feel real small
push them out the way , iced latte tall
i don't really care , i'm already there
caffeinated up to my eyes , i swear
i'm on the top , you on the flop
going so long , and i'm never gonna stop
lost your control , i'm on a roll
right all along and i knew it in my soul
la - la - la
look at me now , fifteen rounds
bottle in my hand , pour a little on the ground
next time you wanna talk trash i'mma put it on blast
you can get it if you ask for it
put it in the middle finger of the fat ladies singing out
shatter every glass house , ni hao
meanwhile , i smile
then i go animal style
i be racking up another million
making me another killin' superwoman on the top dollar bill
and yeah , i muster up a lot of feelings
tell me what you really think about it
kidding , i don't even care
nobody listens to a full gold - coated hater
be a baller , not a traitor
please , got me on my knees
talk to you later , na - na - na - na
whoop , there it go !
right all along and i knew it in my soul
