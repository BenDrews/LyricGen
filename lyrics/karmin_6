too caught up in the moment , fantasy is gone
came down from the high
stare me down with the tension of a thousand daggers
are you surprised ?
here comes the ache , too much to take
you got to let it go ( let it go )
give me a break , it's my mistake
darling , i should've known ( should've known )
i couldn't help it , sorry i'm selfish
but blame it on my heart
blame it on the beating
no alibi , i had to try , baby
blame it on my heart
blame it on my beating heart
trust i wanted to tell you
no , i never meant for you to be hurt
tongue - tied - up my escape plan
now i got a million bridges to burn
here comes the ache , too much to take
you got to let it go ( let it go )
give me a break , it's my mistake
darling , i should've known
i couldn't help it , sorry i'm selfish
but blame it on my heart
blame it on the beating
no alibi , i had to try , baby
blame it on my heart
blame it on the beating
all the things i said
cross them out in red , honey
blame it on my heart
blame it on the feeling
don't make it worse
i can't reverse it so
blame it on my heart
blame it on my beating heart
blame it on the feeling ( blame it , blame it , blame it )
don't make it worse now
blame it on the beating ( blame it , blame it )
all the things i said
na na na , na na , na na ( na , na )
na na na , na na , na na , na ( na , na )
na na na , na na , na na ( na , na )
na na na , na na , na na
i couldn't help it , sorry i'm selfish
but blame it on my heart
blame it on the beating
no alibi , i had to try , baby
blame it on my heart
blame it on the beating
all the things i said
cross them out in red , honey
blame it on my heart
blame it on the feeling
don't make it worse
i can't reverse it so
blame it on my heart
blame it on my beating heart
