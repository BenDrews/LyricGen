when you got the yams— ( what's the yams ? )
the yam is the power that be
you can smell it when i'm walkin' down the street
( oh yes , we can , oh yes , we can )
i can dig rappin' , but a rapper with a ghost writer ?
what the fuck happened ? ( oh no ! )
i swore i wouldn't tell , but most of y'all sharing bars
like you got the bottom bunk in a two - man cell
( a two man cell )
something's in the water ( something's in the water )
and if i gotta brown - nose for some gold
then i'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

you goat - mouth mammyfucker
i was gonna kill a couple rappers , but they did it to themselves
everybody's suicidal , they ain't even need my help
this shit is elementary , i'll probably go to jail
if i shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
stuck a flag in my city , everybody's screamin' " compton ! "
i should probably run for mayor when i'm done , to be honest
and i put that on my mama and my baby boo too
twenty million walkin' out the court buildin' , woo woo !
ah yeah , fuck the judge , i made it past twenty - five , and there i was
a little nappy - headed nigga with the world behind him
life ain't shit but a fat vagina
screamin' " annie , are you okay ? annie , are you okay ? "
limo tinted with the gold plates
straight from the bottom , this the belly of the beast
from a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king
bitch , where was you when i was walkin'— ( *pop* )
by the time you hear the next pop
the funk shall be within you— ( *pop* )
now i run the game , got the whole world talkin'
