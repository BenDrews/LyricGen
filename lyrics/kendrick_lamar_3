me and my niggas tryna get it , ya bish
hit the house lick : tell me , is you wit' it , ya bish ?
home invasion was persuasive
from nine to five i know it's vacant , ya bish
dreams of livin' life like rappers do
back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
i fucked sherane and went to tell my bros
then usher raymond " let it burn " came on
hot sauce all in our top ramen , ya bish
park the car , then we start rhymin' , ya bish
the only thing we had to free our mind
then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
you lookin' like a easy come - up , ya bish
a silver spoon i know you come from , ya bish
and that's a lifestyle that we never knew
go at a reverend for the revenue
it go halle berry or hallelujah
pick your poison , tell me what you doin'
everybody gon' respect the shooter
but the one in front of the gun lives forever
( the one in front of the gun , forever )
and i been hustlin' all day
this - a - way , that - a - way
through canals and alleyways , just to say
money trees is the perfect place for shade
and that's just how i feel , nah , nah
a dollar might just fuck your main bitch
that's just how i feel , nah
a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
that's just how i feel , nah , nah
a dollar might just make that lane switch
that's just how i feel , nah
a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
that's just how i feel
dreams of livin' life like rappers do
bump that new e - 40 after school
you know , “big ballin' with my homies”
earl stevens had us thinkin' rational
back to reality , we poor , ya bish
another casualty of war , ya bish
two bullets in my uncle tony head
he said one day i'll be on tour , ya bish
that louis burger never be the same
a louis belt will never ease that pain
but i'ma purchase when that day is jerkin'
pull off at church's , with pirellis skirtin'
gang signs out the window , ya bish
hopin' all of 'em offend you , ya bish
they say your hood is a pot of gold
and we gon' crash it when nobody's home
it go halle berry or hallelujah
pick your poison , tell me what you doin'
everybody gon' respect the shooter
but the one in front of the gun lives forever
( the one in front of the gun , forever )
and i been hustlin' all day

be the last one out to get this dough ? no way !
love one of you bucket - headed hoes ? no way !
hit the streets , then we break the code ? no way !
hit the brakes when they on patrol ? no way !

imagine rock up in them projects
where them niggas pick your pockets
santa claus don't miss them stockings
liquors spillin' , pistols poppin'
bakin' soda yola whippin'
ain't no turkey on thanksgivin'
my homeboy just dome'd a nigga
i just hope the lord forgive him
pots with cocaine residue
every day i'm hustlin'
what else is a thug to do
when you eatin' cheese from the government ?
gotta provide for my daughter n'em
get the fuck up out my way , bish
got that drum and i got them bands
just like a parade , bish
drop that work up in the bushes
hope them boys don't see my stash
if they do , tell the truth
this the last time you might see my ass
from the gardens where the grass ain't cut
them serpents lurkin' , blood
bitches sellin' pussy , niggas sellin' drugs
but it's all good
broken promises , steal your watch
and tell you what time it is
take your j's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is
in the streets with a heater under my dungarees
dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree
it go halle berry or hallelujah
pick your poison , tell me what you doin'
everybody gon' respect the shooter
but the one in front of the gun lives forever
( the one in front of the gun , forever )
and i been hustlin' all day
this - a - way , that - a - way
through canals and alleyways , just to say
