ain't no tellin' what i'm finna be on
i'm beyond all that fuck shit
somebody told me they ain't never seen
this much buzz around a teen since jojo
more heat than d - wade in a heat wave
but my shit still cold like fro - yo
and they hating cause they only doing so - so
looking at me sideways , xp's logo
yeah you got bars , but niggas need flow tho
#1 draft pick and y'all ain't even go pro
wait up , hold it now , they gone tell me slow my shit down
look at all these plays i get now , play my shit
and they can't sit down , nope
they'll be jumping like they jordan
zack lavine and aaron gordon
i be saucing cause my flow is a1 , yes it's that important
i made my mixtape and niggas run it back
( god damn , god damn )
ya mixtape got a fee , i want my money back
( god damn , god damn )
" don't wanna fall in love " , they was loving that
off " 100 bucks " , i should've made a hundred stacks
they say they proud of me , they say i'm a prodigy
man this shit is just for fun but please don't think it's comedy , cause when it comes pesos , i don't plato , i ain't socrates
they asking how to get green like us , just tell em eat they broccoli , god damn
in the middle of the party bitch get off me
in the cut i'm rolling up my broccoli
ya i know your baby mama fond of me
yall she want to do is smoke that broccoli
whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me
said that i can get that pussy easily
said that i can hit that shit so greasily
i'm a dirty dog i did it sleazily
ain't no tellin' what i'm finna be on
i'm beyond all that fuck shit
ain't no tellin' what i'm finna be on
i'm beyond all that fuck shit
may have made my bed up but i never left her
bitch i'm only cashing checks in with the best investors
young and reckless but i learned my lesson
he rock a halo like the heavens sent him my flow is evervesant
i know timmy would be mad if i ain't snap here
no job making no mula like its last year
young thot racing to my uber like my pads near
stationed in aruba with some shooters like i'm booling
and any nigga perusing tryna catch a consumer
know a couple grease monkeys put a tool through ya cooler serial killers raising bands take 2 move to just scoop her
to any niggas raising hands better hope that i'm schooling
keep her wet like a scuba
so why would you ever tread light with me ?
nappy hair why would you ever pick a fight with me ?
they stop and stare but the camera don't frighten me
they know what i could be
( the best ever nigga )
in the middle of the party bitch get off me
