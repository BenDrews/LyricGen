after practice yesterday , kevin made us aware of discomfort in his right foot. we proceeded to perform the necessary imaging studies to determine the cause of his discomfort. at this stage , kevin has been diagnosed with a jones fracture. traditional treatment of this injury requires a surgical procedure and recent nba cases have resulted in a return to play in 6 - 8 weeks. we are in the process of collaboratively evaluating the most appropriate next steps with kevin , his representatives , and thunder medical personnel. until a course of action is determined , we are unable to provide a timeline specific to kevin's case.
