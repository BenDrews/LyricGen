yeah
talk to me , a little louder
lost too many chances to be chancelor
lead by a red bone like rudolph and prancer
they crabs in a bucket these niggas is cancer
zodiac signs for these cognac vibes boy i rap like it's mines
i swear they bishop cause before they had a pot to piss in
they was dumping clips in and fucking bitches
pac was the vision but they missed the piercing
you ain't got the juice like that !
baby boy your moves ain't black ! why you move like that ?
even though the passion was jackson or jagger
ain't pop but he back and he better
a rap spitting legend up in his head man he actually 7
grown ass kid man take a look at what these grown ups did odd ass nigga doing grown up shit
hope that i ain't waste my time with teambackpack
hope that i could really get my cashback
back and i'm at it making sure i hit that ladder
so i could reach to the attic they missing the feeling
chipping away at the ceiling
that's why they make me the villain
they keep it secret don't really pray but i'm preaching
so i ain't missing no meals
and do this for mom and them and all of the synonyms
that mean all my friends and them
uncles and relatives so don't need no sedatives
to kill with the penmanship shout out to erica
she helping the air adjust it feel like its clearing up
boy with the silver tongue who growing and beard and now these women can't get enough
now everybody wanna work with the kid
everybody wanna build with the kid
wanna chill with the kid
cause they know how much a genius he is
lyrically and mentally sick
2bars about get a deal like i found a fucking coupon
yo hold on , yo
and by the way yo...
