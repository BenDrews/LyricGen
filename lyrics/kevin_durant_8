yeah...
okay....
( hey yeah )
now what makes you think that your so much better ?
how dare you leave your smell on my sweater ?
how dare you hit me in the night
with a smile trying to skype
like we're still friends
when your the whole reason that it did end
when it did had to cry a little
had to ask why a little
had to wish that i died a little
love is a war
but ain't nothing civil
all the shit i would've paid for
for us to not have blown out the candle
if i show up to your house late night for some sugar
could i still get a handful ?
momma always told me be careful
but i didn't listen
played without a full deck
now i'm going fishing
i guess you're too old to be babysitting
cause i have been bad
oh but you know i still gotchu baby
i've been bad
i had to do what i had to do
but you know i still love you
sorry
still i'll take care of you
( hey yeah )
even if you've got a man now
i'd be forced to understand , now
( ooooh )
