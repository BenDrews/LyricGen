there they go again , one of my lil friends
they don't give a damn how a nigga been
all they wanna know is what i got to give
how much did i spend ? what i got to lend ?
what i did and what i didn't do for them
bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim
section doin' numbers , nowhere by a gym
droppin' bottles spend hustlin' i'm supplin' 10
jumpin' out a honda , i just got it in
askin' what i cop , none of your concern
one day you gone learn what you tryna get
everything on sale , goin' out of biz
partners up in jail , gotta feed the kids
juggin' round the city , you know what it is
bread winner business , put that on the wrist

find me balling hard
come from grinding hard
getting calling cards from your barbie doll
when she round me she know i'm her bodyguard
money callin' for me , baby girl i'm sorry
you just high yella you not that important
weight , shape her , i could pin you to the carpet
smell like tartar , i'mma put you in the water
conversation cost a lot of chips
she don't really get a lot of this
engagin' where i'm gazin' at her hips
and ain't nobody makin' no attempts
amazing clip , hanging , slanging dick
maybe we can make it takin' trips
maybe i was thinkin' too impatient
phone ringing , hold up , what it is ?
i got two phones , one for the plug and one for the load
i got two phones , one for the bitches and one for the dough
