pray to god that don't nobody mess with us ( him )
keep it strong in case anyone testing us
right or wrong , if it's this , you don't mess with it

where she been , trying to read all of her messages
i don't speak on no man , that's irregular
take her phone , disconnectin' her cellular
what you need that for undressin' her ?
what you need that for caressin' her ?
spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
pulling her hair from the back , go to pressin' her
trying to see who tap first , made a bet with her
relationship flaking , no eczema
she catching feelings , she say we inseparable

trunk in the front , do it make me a elephant ?

bad bitches in line , they be really trying
they ask me if i'm high , i say , " really really "
got money on my mind , i say , " really really "
