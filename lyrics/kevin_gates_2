i was tryna get it how i live
i want them dead presidents
i wanna pull up , head spin
get it , get fly , i got six jobs , i don't get tired
and i don't get tired , i don't get , i don't get tired
and i don't get tired , i don't get , i don't get tired
and i don't get tired , i don't get , i don't get tired
get it , get fly , i got six jobs , i don't get tired
full time father , full time artist
asked god , he said " grind a little harder "
learn from every time you ever fail
if it never fail just grind smarter
iron sharpens , you the dagger
on they hindquarters and they all acting
rap game , i'm a pallbearer
kill me and get a call after
first look , it was all laughter
kevin gates , no small matter
made men believe what they didn't believe
dive in the crowd , no safety harness
gun in the booth , no safety on it
aim and i shoot for the stars
at the awards i ain't win no awards
only meaning one thing , don't get tired , i go hard
i was tryna get it how i live
i want them dead presidents
i wanna pull up , head spin
get it , get fly , i got six jobs , i don't get tired
and i don't get tired , i don't get , i don't get tired
and i don't get tired , i don't get , i don't get tired
and i don't get tired , i don't get , i don't get tired
get it , get fly , i got six jobs , i don't get tired
me and the woman i love on an air mattress
we share a cot , my hair nappy
couldn't afford flights , no air travel
stale rice krispies like sand and gravel
our testament to what can happen
the moment you follow your heart
keeping the faith even when it get dark
they say give up as i tell them " get lost "
six weeks ago i just purchased a foreign
most likely the one that you cannot afford
right foot on the gas
balenciaga be accelerating , i'm doing the dash
chick that i'm with
shorty be doing her shit and it's okay to say that she bad
look to the right and i give her a glance
pray to god we don't , pray to god we don't crash
i was tryna get it how i live
i want them dead presidents
i wanna pull up , head spin
get it , get fly , i got six jobs , i don't get tired
and i don't get tired , i don't get , i don't get tired
and i don't get tired , i don't get , i don't get tired
and i don't get tired , i don't get , i don't get tired
get it , get fly , i got six jobs , i don't get tired
only meaning one thing , don't get tired , i go hard
don't play with the hustle , you eat or you starve
don't mimic pretenders , just be who you are
ain't never change , been like this from the start
only meaning one thing , don't get tired , i go hard
don't play with the hustle , you eat or you starve
don't mimic pretenders , just be who you are
get it , get fly , i got six jobs , i don't get tired
i was tryna get it how i live
i want them dead presidents
i wanna pull up , head spin
get it , get fly , i got six jobs , i don't get tired
and i don't get tired , i don't get , i don't get tired
and i don't get tired , i don't get , i don't get tired
and i don't get tired , i don't get , i don't get tired
get it , get fly , i got six jobs , i don't get tired
and i don't get tired
and i don't get tired
and i don't get tired
get it , get fly , i got six jobs , i don't get tired
