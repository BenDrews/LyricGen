let me at them
say you love me , yeah
say you love me , yeah
i know that i'm not the only one
struggles i done overcome
i killed that nigga for my dog and now he owe me one
lay me for a brick layer slangin' weight
fell in love , made a new mistake
baby momma arguin' , askin' where was i
instead i ask her " how we do today ? "
breakin' through the safe in pin with solid ye
i most likely blew through 28
women shady , how come i ain't choose to hate ?
loyal to 'em how come i ain't see the play ?
couldn't see no wrong in people tryna help 'em
wanna see my youngin's really eatin'
goaltending , blocking blessings for no reason
one bedroom apartment watchin' killer season
had my share , funny tell you while it's secret
people that you love and they not sharin' nothin'
see you pockets ugly , won't reach out for nothin'
i can't wait to catch you bitches out in public
buyin' out the mall , fuck your bitch in front you
okay too aggressive , other women love it
i don't kiss and tell , lot of artists wonder
cut the bra , and punch it longer in her stomach
rough and rugged , took some losses , money doubled
toilet bowl , thinking shittin' on 'em , fuck it
playin' chess and the bishop on the muscle
you would never love me like my daughter love me
i can't be the one you love
and i can't be the one you love
struggles i overcome
killed that nigga for my dog and now he owe me one
say you love me , yeah
say you love me , yeah
i know that i'm not the only one
say you love me , yeah
say you love me , yeah
say you love me , yeah
i know that i'm not the only one
actors got stripes they ain't never earned
not a freak for fame , rather wait my turn
say he taddle - tailing put him in the dirt
fuck his family members , they can wear his shirt
every rapper talkin' cookin' dope
flippity flip , break - break your wrist
i desire now to be alone , no attention if it's ignorance
to say it frankly , i don't give a shit
breathin' hard , come on say what's in your thoughts
somethin' on your mind , i could take it off
money mean nothin' , i want my respect
death before dishonor tatted on my flesh
holes in my clothes , underarms smellin'
million man march this ain't malcolm x
welfare , receivin' government assistance
get up out the bed , spend up all they check
how you don't know that , you ain't never yeah
what you mean by ye , talkin' sellin' crack
embalming fluid runs through montana
thinking going back and peddle weight
pills that reedy stuck stopping up the brig
renegade hoes settin' up the trench
junkies usin' h , it's a better feel
i can't be the one you love
and i can't be the one you love
struggles i overcome
killed that nigga for my dog and now he owe me one
say you love me , yeah
say you love me , yeah
i know that i'm not the only one
say you love me , yeah
say you love me , yeah
say you love me , yeah
i know that i'm not the only one
ain't been havin' no dreams
don't be gettin' no sleep
how can someone call me those things
they don't even know me
i lost everything i love a week ago
loyalty which probably mean the most
heart played on every time i gave
makin' me afraid of being close
big dog , mouth full of gold
big loud , ounce getting rolled
we dive out 20 shows
radio stop playin' songs
i ain't really feel like i was wrong
southside finest get it on
right back grindin' , teeth grittin'
ship sinkin' , cry about it ? no
catch 'em with the lyrics on a whim
the one who spoke the laws i am him
started out , we wanted us some ends
late night discussion of a benz
late night we fussin' bout the rent
eviction notice posted , i ain't notice
focused tryna get another flip
wasn't makin' half of what i spent
tee newman passenger , we lit
i just got with mocha that's a lick
conversation with the boss man , look
we was talkin' signin' him again
women wanna clown in front they friends
like you was not respectin' what it is
listen when i tell you what it is
to be around you signin' a consent
you know i just got married to your friend
i done threw a ring around the dick
diamonds dancin' every time i spit
had to throw some bling up on a bitch
self made stand up guy
god first , hands to the sky
all i do is ride nigga , yeah
i don't even argue about the bread
that lil' money that you owe me , you can have
i can't even see me gettin' mad
i can't even see me goin' backwards
know you wanna see me on my ass
cuttin' up with dreka fine ass
swagger matchin' , where'd you find that ?
i just rode a stick with mad air
please me let me enjoy the ride back
please me let me enjoy the ride back
could you please me let me enjoy the ride back ?
i just rolled a stick with mad air
cuttin' up with dreka fine ass
swagger matchin' , where'd you find that ?
see i live my life like you know i'm gonna enjoy this bitch 'cause you never know when this gon' be over. i can't be the one you love
