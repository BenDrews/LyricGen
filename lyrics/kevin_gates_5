yeah
do you think iâ€™ll ever need you , love , more than you need me ?
show me your true colors girl , i just want to see
'cause i done had too many come around and change on me
she screamin' please don't waste my time
i say i totally agree
see girl i'm fine with that
i done gave my watches away , ain't got no time for that
askin' where's my heart , good luck findin' that
how long could i see her round still think i'm timin' that
think i'm still timin' that
pretty teeth with a nice demeanor
i'm in a rush , it was nice to meet ya
collard shirt , no elongated t's , cheaper to be yourself
ain't no wrong way to be , accomplished a lot
came from the block , ambitious in the trenches
i got a long way to reach
sorry if i was offensive , but not at all
you got to pardon me at times , okay problem solved
when i hear the word can't take it like a challenge
i don't understand why the hell i can't have it
help me understand why the hell i can't have it
i was blessed with a swag and i ain't braggin'
insecurities get covered with designer fashion
if i'm not intimidatin' tell me why you're bashful
if you not feelin' what i'm sayin' , sorry for the hassle
but if you leavin' here with me it'll be fantastic
do you think i'll ever need you love more than you need me ?

askin' where's my heart , good luck findin' that
how long could i see her round think i'm still timin' that
think i'm still timin' that
ain't no relaxin' , they pillow fightin' on the sofa
not at all my main focus though i was hopin'
pull your hair , kiss it soft while you bendin' over
after that we could shower and i could hold ya
havin' deep conversation and now you open
pretendin' that i was asleep while you on the phone
listen to you tell your girlfriend how i stroke it
only that it was a foot i already know it , mind blowin'
phone rang bout to go , is you rollin'
playin' poker no cards , throwin' hands exposin'
rest in peace soulja slim , slow motion
kicked out of everywhere , expulsion
do you think i'll ever need your love more than you need me ?
