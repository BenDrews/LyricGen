she says i'm a dog , but it takes one to know one , alright
and i can go for hours , ain't believe me , had to show one , alright
see i prefer the floor , not the bed
fiendin' for me , i can get it wet
she says i'mma dog , but it takes one to know one , alright
let me see you drop it , throw it back
i'm bout to pin you to the carpet
like a slur , you goin' fast
i'm bout to make you get up off it
couple bald head hoes , lotta long weave
got a tall red head ho , swear she wants me
shawty need some transportation , but she can't afford it
how bout you ride this dick to work , but just watch where you goin'
take my time grippin' on her waist line
started this at night now it's approachin' daylight
she says i'm a dog , but it takes one to know one , alright
and i can go for hours , ain't believe me , had to show one , alright
see i prefer the floor , not the bed
fiendin' for me , i can get it wet
she says i'mma dog , but it takes one to know one , alright
don't nobody else compare the way gates do you
pull your hairs , smack your ass , knock your break shoes loose
other lames take you out shoppin' , dinner , and a movie
suck your titty in the mirror with a finger in your booty
top drop in a foreign , blowin' smoke up into heaven
right hand on your inner thigh , gently i'm caressin'
say it make your pussy moist every time the engine revvin'
gettin' dressed inside designer stores , you know how we be steppin'
she says i'm a dog , but it takes one to know one , alright
and i can go for hours , ain't believe me , had to show one , alright
see i prefer the floor , not the bed
fiendin' for me , i can get it wet
she says i'mma dog , but it takes one to know one , alright
gon' be a while before it's over
don't say i didn't warn ya
i can't even lie girl , you the truth
bedroom or the sofa , your legs around my shoulder
my attention , givin' all of it to you
it'll be an hour before it's over
gon' be a while before it's over
i can't even lie girl , you the truth
bedroom or the sofa , your legs around my shoulder
my attention , givin' all of it to you
she says i'm a dog , but it takes one to know one , alright
and i can go for hours , ain't believe me , had to show one , alright
see i prefer the floor , not the bed
fiendin' for me , i can get it wet
she says i'mma dog , but it takes one to know one , alright
