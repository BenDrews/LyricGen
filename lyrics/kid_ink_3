money and the power
once you get a 'lil they just want to take you down ( cause )
i got the money and the power
once you get a 'lil they just want to take you down ( cause )
we’ve been going hard for too long
can’t get enough , what is you on ?
really ain’t nothing , i could drop that
wake up in the morning , make it all back
it’s nothing , nothing to get it poppin’
wanna roll. roll up , up , and away
here we go now
now martin had a dream , i’ve been dreamin’ ’bout gold
tell ‘em i just wanna shine , and i gotta let it show
show up on the scene , walk right through the door
got a nigga on repeat , it’s my double up flow
vibrate the whole building , i ain’t ringing through your phone
waiting ’til the smoke clear , can you see me through the fog ?
fall back , it could go all bad
we be goin’ hard with your ex , oh tic - tac
tacky motherfuckers must not be hip yet
life is a bitch , but i bet i get that bitch wet
we , we’ve been going hard for too long
can’t get enough , what is you on ? ( yeah )
really ain’t nothing , i can drop that
wake up in the morning , make it all back
we , we’ve been going hard for too long
we , we’ve been going hard for too long
ma - money and the power
once you get a little , they just wanna take you down ( cause )
but i’m ready , ready , so you can tell ‘em to bring it on
on a whole other level of high , no phone
foes all mad ’cause the dough don’t fold
forget about your plans , we ain’t leavin’ ’til it close
close to the top , i can barely see the ground
with the whole team here , everybody get around
look like a parade when we’re coming through your town
one hand to the sky , two feet to the ground
wait , can’t stop ’til the sun’s up
party everywhere ever since i got my funds up
yup , pray to god it never run out
off that loud , burnin’ rubber , need to slow it down
mon - money and the power
once you get a little , they just wanna take you down , ( cause ( x2 ) )
that , that’s how it is
when you fuckin’ with me , you should know how it goes
that , that’s how it is
i’ve got a bottle in my hand and a pocket full of dough
