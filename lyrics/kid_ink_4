get a couple shots when it's crunch time , ducking from my ex like a one time
throw a sign when you really tryna go , got the car parked right at the door
i don't know your name , but you've heard my name
i know why you came , tryna get that name
but you heard my name

i said fuck whoever you came with , who you came with , i told her " fuck that nigga " ( i don't know ya )

i might'a poured you a drink , but don't let it go to your head
i know why you came , tryna be my main chick
passenger side when i lane switch , top back , two seats only , ain't no room for your friends , i don't know them
we just seizing the moment , up all night , throw a deuce to the morning
fly motherfucker , everything is imported , don't try to act too important , i know your game
you got a gang of niggas , all over you , but you all over here , on me
girl , i ain't tryna dog ya , bad bitch only thing i'll call you
i don't know your name , but you've heard my name
i know why you came , tryna get that name
but you heard my name
girl i know you wanna be my main chick , my main chick
i said fuck whoever you came with , who you came with , i told her " fuck that nigga "

i don't know your name , but you've heard my name
i know why you came , tryna get that name
but you heard my name
