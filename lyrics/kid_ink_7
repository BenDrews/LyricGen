came in at first , had bad luck
got a whole lot , remember i ain't had nothin'
we done sold out , now everybody mad at me
tell 'em roll out , now everybody smashin'
get ready cause you know we 'bout to be a problem
hope you ready cause you know it 'bout to be a problem
it's the only way we know to go
squad up , never roll alone
and we gon' ride on forever
we ride out together
pull up right in your zone
take over the street , that's how we roll
and we gon' ride on forever
we ride out together
fancy when i drive , six cars in the driveway
cash in the driver door , spend it , do it my way
i fight you like a matador , fresh out the catalog
one fall we all fall , crew like dominoes
paper chase , vamanos , all my dogs riding smoke
mob heavy like the pope , for that pot of gold
we are not alone , boy , better check your tone
you gone need a lot of help , i ain't talkin' bank loans
sit with us , table last supper
toast to the brothers , some bad motherfuckers
yeah , ain't nothin' but pure luxury
you lookin' left to me , should be looking up to me
preferably one of the best
she ridin' cause we next now and forever to death
be loyal , real , and respect , stay ahead of the rest
we just sit back , relax , doin' things to impress
it's the only way we know to go
squad up , never roll alone
and we gon' ride on forever
we ride out together
pull up right in your zone
take over the street , that's how we roll
and we gon' ride on forever
we ride out together
got no time to waste
and no way these niggas stoppin' me , oh no
flyin' from a mile away
it's not a problem , only real ones follow me
and i can do this with my eyes closed
blindfold two times over
ride solo , i got women and got soldiers
i ain't trippin' , you try to get it your night's over
talkin' on melatonin , get it and fight coma
what's defeat to a giant , niggas feedin' the fire
history , niggas be less them niggas flee when they flyin'
you don't believe it ? then try it
we don't believe in just tryin'
i call it peoples and leave 'em in 100 pieces divided
that's cold - blooded
and i've been this dope for like four summers
and i ain't really going for the he say , or she say
keep it g for pete's sake
i know this shit that bone you pick
might leave you niggas fillets
it's the only way we know to go
squad up , never roll alone
and we gon' ride on forever
we ride out together
pull up right in your zone
take over the street , that's how we roll
and we gon' ride on forever
we ride out together
it's yg 4hunnid !
is you ridin' ?
is you with all the burglarizing and the violence
if jimmy got caught up , but you was right there with him
so the police askin' you questions , is you gone keep quiet ? ?
is you loyal , is you real , is you fake ?
when i can't tell that's the type of way that i hate
you got that fake - friend syndrome
there's no cure so them symptoms is gon' show
you know the code , stick around , hold it down , never fold
like it's a crease up in your dicky browns
hold up , each one teach one
motivate each one to be something
cause i ain't just another statistic
i do this , this , and that if you wanna get specific
i'm just tryna make bread come quicker
for me and my day one hittas
ride out !
