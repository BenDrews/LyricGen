egh , yeah , okay
now , just picture me , high up with my top down
on highland and sunset , doing 85 on the top deck
see , step by step we walking on stars
if you're looking for some action , you ain't gotta go that far
now , just picture me hollywood living
riding through the sun , riding through the sunset
now , stop tripping , just give me a minute
and wait until the sun , wait until the sun goes down
man , you know how it go down , man , you know how it go down
i'll entertain ya , just wait until the sun goes down
you know how it go down , you know how it go down
might get a little crazy , just wait until the sun goes down
underground , any city i come in town
it's touchdown , hail mary , getting to the dough like pillsbury
all night , don't feel worried , high up is where we will be
nah , you ain't gotta feel guilty , won't judge you , gon' be free
so pour what you want , go head , roll what you want
fuck they say somebody walking 'round here like they somebody
don't know what kind of day i had , with all this weight , couldn't hold my bag
don't hold me back from my habits , live the fast life for the magic
i'm just looking 'round for the baddest hollywood face with an ass from dallas
big - ass crib , nigga living in a palace
we rolling out and my hands on the wheel so tight , got a callus
get so fabulous with everybody here , only thing that matters
now , just picture me hollywood living
and wait until the sun , wait until the sun goes down
man , you know how it go down , man , you know how it go down
i'll entertain ya , just wait until the sun goes down
you know how it go down , you know how it go down
might get a little crazy , just wait until the sun goes down
and it's go time , i swear this feeling's like we inches from the goal line
now or never , better make your mind
might hit her with a line like " what's your sign ? " hit her with a glass of sparkling wine
hit her on the ass , she might not mind , acting like a 10 , look more like a 9 , but
don't be stuck up , really , how could you not see us ?
doing it big , it's obvious , you ain't gotta say much , cause
i know you're sick and tired , sick and tired of all that bullshit
then don't be afraid , take a shot and bite the bullet
that's one in the hole , can't get enough , need one or two more
tell 'em catch up , they're running to slow , out the gutter , i learned to bowl
and finally it's movie time to show them i play the role
of a champion , you see the goal , light shine bright , can't see the road
now , just picture me hollywood living
riding through the sun , riding through the sunset
now , stop tripping , just give me a minute
and wait until the sun , wait until the sun goes down
just picture me hollywood living
riding through the sun , riding through the sunset
now , stop tripping , just give me a minute
and wait until the sun , wait until the sun goes down
man , you know how it go down , man , you know how it go down
i'll entertain ya , just wait until the sun goes down
you know how it go down , you know how it go down
might get a little crazy , just wait until the sun goes down
