i'm just what you made god - not many i trust
i'mma go my own way , god , take my fate to wherever you want
i'm out here , on my son , won't stop 'til i get me some
club - hoppin' , tryin' to get me some , bad bitches wanna get me sprung
early in the morning , i'm wakin' bakin' , drinkin' , contemplatin'
ain't no such thing as satan , evil is what you make it
thank the lord for that burning bush , that big body benz i was born to push
on my way i'm burning kush , nigga don't be worried 'bout us
neighbors knockin' on the door , asking can we turn it down
i say , " ain't no music on " she said , " naw , that weed is loud "
nigga , we ballin' , straight swaggin' , lost hawk , but i'm maintainin'
i've been told that i'm amazing , make sure keep that fire blazin' , we livin'
i need smoke
i need to smoke
who gon' hold me down now
i wanna get high y'all
i wanna get high y'all
need it need it to get by y'all
can you get me high y'all ?
i wanna get high y'all
i wanna get high y'all
need it need it to get by y'all

i'm just what you made god , just what you made god ( nee - need it )
i'm just what you made god , i'm just what you made
( nee - need it ) i'm just what you made god
i'm just what you made god , i'm just what you made god
let me tell you ‘bout my month y'all , endless shopping , i had a ball
i had to ball for therapy , my shrink don’t think that helps at all
whatever , that man ain’t wearing these leather pants
i diagnose my damn self , these damn pills ain’t working fam
in my spare time , punching walls , fucking up my hand
i know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you’d understand
but , i can’t fold , some poor soul got it way worse
we’re all troubled , in a world of trouble
it’s scary to have a kid walk this earth
i’m what you made god , fuck yes i’m so odd
thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren’t my friends all along
hm , when it rains it pours , whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
everyday to find sane’s a chore , amidst a dream with no exit doors
i need smoke
i need to smoke
who gon' hold me down now
i wanna get high y'all
i wanna get high y'all
need it need it to get by y'all
can you get me high y'all ?
i wanna get high y'all
i wanna get high y'all
need it need it to get by y'all
can you get me high y'all ?
i'm just what you made god , just what you made god ( nee - need it )
i'm just what you made god , i'm just what you made
( nee - need it ) i'm just what you made god
i'm just what you made god , i'm just what you made god
need it to get by , ya
