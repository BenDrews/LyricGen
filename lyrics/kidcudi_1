mmmm , ay - oh
heyyy...
ratatat
yeah !
na - na - na - nah
na - na - na - nah
crush a bit , little bit
roll it up , take a hit
feeling lit , feeling right
2 am , summer night
i don't care , hand on the wheel
driving drunk , i'm doing my thing
rolling in the midwest side and out
living my life , getting out dreams
people told me slow my roll
i'm screaming out : " fuck that "
i'mma do just what i want
looking ahead , no turning back
if i fall , if i die ; know i lived it to the fullest
if i fall , if i die ; know i lived and missed some bullets
i'm on the pursuit of happiness , and i know
everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
hey , i'll be fine once i get it
i'll be good
i'm on the pursuit of happiness and i know
everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
hey , i'll be fine once i get it
i'll be good
tell me what you know about dreaming , dreaming
you don't really know about nothing , nothing
tell me what you know about them night terrors , every night
5 am , cold sweats , waking up to the sky
tell me what you know about dreams , dreams
tell me what you know about night terrors , nothing
you don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow
i'm on the pursuit of happiness , and i know
everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
hey , i'll be fine once i get it
i'll be good
i'm on the pursuit of happiness , and i know
everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
hey , i'll be fine once i get it
i'll be good
i'm on the pursuit of happiness
i know everything that shine ain't always gold
i'll be fine once i get it
i'll be good
i'm on the pursuit of happiness , and i know
everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
hey , i'll be fine once i get it
i'll be good
i'm on the pursuit of happiness , and i know
everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
hey , i'll be fine once i get it
i'll be good
pursuit of happiness
