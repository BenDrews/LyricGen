it’s just me and my niggas
and my family
and people that care about me and my fans
fuck all these other niggas
i can’t decide
what if life’s a lie ?
i push the lames aside
they’ll learn
i can never front , know why ?
it’s not my style , no lie
fuck all the talk
in time , they’ll burn
i can’t decide
what if life’s a lie ?
i push the lames aside
they’ll learn
i can never front , know why ?
its not my style , no lie
they’ll never take me alive
king wizard !
you love that little bit of new , now throwback
cleveland city snakeskin snapback
niggas know the uniform , keep the brim low
you doubt him , don't know a damn thing about him
what is hip hop without him , y'all niggas just really don't know
go , all day every day , hold on with all might
i gave the world my heart and they gave the kids insight
yup now fuck you i ain't left
i'm outta my mind like all the time
and a nigga ain't missed one step ( yet , yup )
i can’t decide
what if life’s a lie ?
i push the lames aside
they’ll learn
i can never front , know why ?
it’s not my style , no lie
fuck all the talk
in time , they’ll burn
i can’t decide
what if life’s a lie ?
i push the lames aside
they’ll learn
i can never front , know why ?
its not my style , no lie
they’ll never take me alive
king wizard !
my head hurt , gotta give me something that'll make me feel good
i remember couldn't tell a nigga nothing , man i wish you would
niggas ain't working , like me i had to put my bid in
all this rose gold i'm dipped in
juste un clou , while i coast through clouds
that's my life babe , crystal clear , no cascade
i'm going , going i'm on a crusade
to save the kids from the weak shit
it's finally gonna be my world
here all the girls can be my girls
just sit back count stacks girl
hold a nigga down all the time girl
i can’t decide
what if life’s a lie ?
i push the lames aside
they’ll learn
i can never front , know why ?
it’s not my style , no lie
fuck all the talk
in time , they’ll burn
i can’t decide
what if life’s a lie ?
i push the lames aside
they’ll learn
i can never front , know why ?
its not my style , no lie
they’ll never take me alive
king wizard !
