i am the smartest man alive !
i tried to tell all my friends when i was a kid that i had powers
and nobody wanted to believe me
all right
spent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself
i couldn't speak anything of real hope
and the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
a sudden change in my groove , in my walk ( hmmm )
i got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
shocking waves make me feel i can float
it's like the city is mine and the dark is my cape
i can't explain this sudden peace in my walk , i sure hope
i'm living my life as if i got powers
and tonight i feel immortal
i said tonight i feel immortal
tonight i feel immortal
hmmm hmmm , hmmm hmmm , hmmm hmmm
hmmm hmmm , hmmm hmmm , hmmm hmmm
bet you want to see me weak
not sort of my thing you see
i'm too damn cool , my mojo too dope
it's the same old thing getting lost day n' nite , young and lost in the pain
so many times i've broke this vicious cycle
i got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
shocking waves make me feel i can float
surely i'mma do what i want , ain't got no one to blame
i can't explain this sudden peace in my walk , i sure hope
i'm living my life as if i got powers
and tonight i feel immortal
i said tonight i feel immortal
tonight i feel immortal
hmmm hmmm , hmmm hmmm , hmmm hmmm
hmmm hmmm , hmmm hmmm , hmmm hmmm
i'm living my life as if i got powers
and tonight i feel immortal
i said tonight i feel immortal
tonight i feel immortal
ohh , tonight i feel immortal
hmmm hmmm , hmmm hmmm , hmmm hmmm
hmmm hmmm , hmmm hmmm , hmmm hmmm
dont fuck with me. fuck with me. don't , don't fuck with me. fuck with me
