plain pat , what up ?
my heart thump
not from being nervous
sometimes i'm thinking god
made me special here on purpose
so all the while , til i'm gone
make my words important
so if i slip away , if i die today
the last thing you remember won't be
about some apple bottom jeans
with the boots with the fur
maybe how i dreamed of being free since my birth
cursed , but the demons i confronted would disperse
have you ever heard of some shit so real
beyond , from the heart , from the soul , you can feel
and if i die before i wake
i pray the lord my soul to take
but please don't cry
just know that i have made these songs for you
and if i die before i wake
i pray the lord my soul to take
cause i'm ready for the funeral
my mind runs
i could never catch it
even if i got a head start
god please help me
i am feeling so alone , wait
i don't need to worry
cause i know the world'll feel this , nigga
blessing in disguise , but
i am not hiding who i am , open your eyes , bro
if i ever met you , i appreciate the love , yo
girls that i dated , it's okay , i am not mad , yo
unless you stabbed me in the heart , no love ho
the shit is so ill
play it back from the top if you recognize real
and if i die before i wake
i pray the lord my soul to take
but please don't cry
just know that i have made these songs for you
and if i die before i wake
i pray the lord my soul to take
cause i'm ready for the funeral
and if i die before i wake
i pray the lord my soul to take
but please don't cry
just know that i have made these songs for you
and if i die before i wake
i pray the lord my soul to take
cause i'm ready for the funeral
i'm ready for the funeral , hey - hey
i'm ready for the funeral , hey
i'm ready for the funeral
hey , i'm ready for it
i'm ready for it
i'm ready for the funeral
