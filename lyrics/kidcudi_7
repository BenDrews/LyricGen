she said i don't spend time like i really should
she said she don't know me anymore
i think she hates me deep down , i know she does
she wants to erase me
a couple days , no talking , i see my baby
and this what she tells me
she said : i keep on running , keep on running
and nothing works , i can't get away from you , no
i keep on ducking , keep on ducking you , nothing helps
i can't stop missing you
it's like i'm her new nightmare , she ain't escaping
it makes me feel a bit complete
knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
memories they soon delete
a couple weeks , no talking , i see my baby
i missed you so damn much
hey , i wish we could start over , i told my baby
this what this bitch tells me
she said : i keep on running , keep on running , and nothing works
i can't get away from you , no
i keep on ducking , keep on ducking you , nothing helps
i can't stop missing you
yeah , cause i'm in the magazines , on the tv
no matter where you are , you might hear me
i'm in the magazines , on the tv
no matter where you go , you might see me
i'm yeezy , she say " hi , i'm aria "
no , you a angel , you wave " hi " to aaliyah
i got a show in korea , they built a new arena
why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
i know i seen you before , but don't know where i seen ya
oh i remember now , it's something that i dreamed of
don c says she cool , but don't let her fuck your cream up
monica lewinsky on the dress , you take her to the cleaners
sure enough , a week later , i'm in extra love
and everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
every bouncer , every club show her extra love
we just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
but all good things gotta come to a en - a
she let it go to her head , " no , not my aria "
the height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
i couldn't get my shit out anyway , i hope you die aria !
i keep on running , keep on running
and nothing works , i can't get away from you , no
i keep on ducking , keep on ducking you , nothing helps
i can't stop missing you
