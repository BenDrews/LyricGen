yeah , i see you hatin' over there
see you jockin' over there , see you lookin' at my girl over here
why you worried 'bout this girl over here ?
keep your eyes over there , it is creepy when you stare
come on , hey , i see you hatin' over there
i see you jockin' over there , think about your own life
why you talkin' 'bout the young hippy ?
i'm just doin' my thang , if you know what i mean , get it right
and they think they know
and they think they know the deal , for real
i'm just doin' my thang , if you know what i mean , get it right
and they think they know
and they think they know the deal , for real
i'm just doin' my thang , if you know what i mean , yo
i don't love who i am so i'm workin' on a fix
i don't need a bitch try'na tear my mind on my grip
if i had one wish , it'd be to have more wishes , duh
fuck tryna make it rhyme
throw them stones , with your bitch ass
cutting me deep and even though i bleed
i stand alone , alone i'll be
heart of a lion still shining on your sucka ass
workin' , workin' , workin' , for inner peace
fightin' for the freedom of my soul , i can hear the speech
yeah i mumble while i'm trippin on so many pills
hah , they figured that they know a nigga
yeah , i see you hatin' over there
see you jockin' over there , see you lookin' at my girl over here
why you worried 'bout this girl over here ?
keep your eyes over there , it is creepy when you stare
come on , hey , i see you hatin' over there
i see you jockin' over there , think about your own life
why you talkin' 'bout the young hippy ?
i'm just doin' my thang , if you know what i mean , get it right
and they think they know
and they think they know the deal , for real
i'm just doin' my thang , if you know what i mean , get it right
and they think they know
and they think they know the deal , for real
i'm just doin' my thang , if you know what i mean , yo
