alright , run it
i never gave a fuck
i never gave a fuck about what niggas thought about me
i mean , i did , but , like , fuck it , you know what i'm saying ?
you gon' love me man
you gon' love me mane
they can't comprehend
or even come close to understanding him
i guess if i was boring they would love me more
guess if i was simple in the mind
everything would be fine
maybe if i was a jerk to girls
instead of being nice and speaking kind words
then maybe it would be ok to say then
i wasn't a good guy to begin with
but my mind is all crazy
they got me thinking i ain't human
like i came in from above
feeling like an airplane in the sky
but then they say i'm crazy
they got me thinking i ain't human
like i came in from above
feeling like a bird sitting high
i be that man on the moon , i'm that man on the moon
and i'mma do what i do , so do you , hey - hey
i be posted with my blunt and a brew , my dude
i'm that man on the moon , i'm up - up on the moon
it's like , i'mma play all my stuff for everybody
and you know , and all my people they give me feedback
you know , and they be like
" yo , yo , why your shit sound so different ? "
you know what i'm saying ?
" why your shit , like on another level - -
why's , why's it sound so different ? "
like that's a bad thing
and i be like
" why not ? nigga "
close my eyes , hide in the dark
it's a curtain call ; come one , come all
all i do is try to make it simple
the ones that make it complicated
never get congratulated
i'm something different , all aspects
don't want a woman just to love her assets
i'll still wife her up , even with her flat chest
the type to get hurt , but that's the past tense
my mind is all hazy
i be thinkin' that i'm wrong
cause they used to call me lame
my swag was a little different
but then my mind is hazy
i be thinkin' that i'm wrong
but they the ones who lame
i got the last laugh , nigga
i be that man on the moon , i'm that man on the moon
and i'mma do what i do , so do you , hey - hey
i be posted with my blunt and a brew , my dude
i'm that man on the moon , i'm up - up on the moon
