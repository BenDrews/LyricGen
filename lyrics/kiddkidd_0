tell all my haters this is payback
and i ain't talkin' givin' change back

a dozen bottles comin' my direction
smoke presidential like i got elected
young nigga ball so hard i got ejected

a dozen bottles comin' my direction

i say all of my niggas trigger happy
we poppin' bottles like we shootin' at you

come on pussy nigga , try your luck , better be lucky
shut up , let the money talk , don't interrupt me

and if i make it through the night i pray i wake up
to a bad bitch with no makeup

they tried to say that i was worthless
and that my life , it had no purpose
they want indict me with the rico
they say they caught me talkin' kilos
me and my people off the east coast'll
beat the game like a cheat code
money never on vacation , my corner never vacant
got what it takes to make it , i don't make it i'ma take it
i was local , i was nation , i went global , they start hatin'
i come from the end of somethin' so i spend
