i'm giving y'all real shit , yeen ain't even know it

wayne messed up off that lean , and i'm still pourin
my p.o. piss testing me , but i'm still smokin
before rap nigga i was a crack dealer , yeen ain't even know it
why scrap with you , pull a gat quicker , yeen ain't even totin
pay a thousand dollars for a pair of pants , yeen ain't even know it
you saw the tag and you walked past , couldn't even afford it
that rida gang what i claim , that's my slogan
feel squirt off , with the shirt off , quicker than hulk hogan
this rap beef is just rap beef , i ain't even worried
i know real killers that's after me , and i ain't even worried
my mixtape a whole masterpiece , but you don't even know it
something that tyson be glad to see , can't even show him
i'm outside , park where you sleep , you don't even know it
look how a nigga got you on beam , you don't even know it
your main bitch was a one nighter , you don't even know it
you went cuffed her , you went wifed her , cause yeen ain't even know it
that's fake titties and fake ass , but yeen ain't even know it
you runnin round like that bitch bad , cause yeen ain't even know it

i mean liquor , you thinking cash , cause yeen ain't even know it
this audemar 'bout 80 thou , but yeen ain't even know it
i'm in the hood , but i got a big old house , i don't even go in
way out of state and i barely stay , but yeen ain't even know it
they like kidd you one hit away , i already know it
this rap game only getting worse , you don't even know it
trinidad james song had one verse , yeen ain't even know it
on forever track with drake first , but yeen ain't even know it
been tooken over a few hit songs , i learned you gotta keep going
i come straight from the bottom , tell me how you ain't know it
everytime that i'm rhyming , i be telling my story
i jump for joy and they free my pa , you ain't even know it
18 years behind bars , you ain't even know it
consequences come when you hustle , you don't even know it
your best friend's an undercover , but yeen ain't even know it
they in the life with the struggle , i'm the king of my jungle
where niggas die right in front of you , trust who , i don't even know it
i got shot about 6 times , but you don't even know it
you could ask me how did i survive ? i don't even know it
must be fate cause i'm still here , no wheelchair but i'm rolling
got nightmares of kanye walking on stage stealing my moment
i'm blowin purp and i'm pourin purp and i'm poppin percs and i'm zonin
