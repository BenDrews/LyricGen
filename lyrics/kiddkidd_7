when i die hope my soul don't fry
lord knows i done tried
on my grind , pyrex on that fire
money on my mind , look in my eye
you can see i'm high , bitch , respect my mind
step aside , you ain't 'bout that life
you just tryna rhyme , my bitch would die
and she keep an eye , hand her 9 to 5
i wanna fuck , she gonna give it up
she don't waste no time , doing fine
i'm dumping shots , one of a kind
you must be blind , can't see me shine
the world is mine
i'm a g , bury me a g
in a pair of sneaks , fresh tee
true religion jeans , man , i rest in peace
bitch , i'm a g , bury me a g
bitch , remember me , bitch , i'm a g
bury me a g , bury me a g
yeah , i'm a g , bury me a g
in a pair of sneaks , fresh tee
true religion jeans , man , i rest in peace
man , i'm a g , bury me a g
bitch , remember me , bitch , i'm a g
bury me a g , bury me a g
flipping coke back when i was broke
all i had was hope
selling dreams , i'm selling soap
just until i scope
got my dough , now i want some more
you know how i go , hit the floor
move or get smoked , it ain't a joke
boy , i need cheese like pizza , pizza
gimme all your cash and visas
introduce my millimeter , please to meet you
it's wrong but life goes on
another song , sing along
one to the dome , that nigga gone , leave me alone
i'm in my zone , them zone i'm repping , it's my own
i'm never stepping without my chrome
shit is real , i'm in that field
i might get killed , i'm overdue
before i do , i need a mil'
i ain't gotta tell you , bitch , i'mma show you
nobody know you , heavy metal , we rock and rollers
we pop them coasters in your section
go fuck that ' we split the dough up , we young soldiers
15 and older , nobody told us
if they did , we wouldn't notice , we on that corner getting loaded
this pistol loaded , i heard your crib is fully loaded , we 'bout to go in
mask on , kick the door in , which room the dough in ?
we in them streets , beefing never cease
rest in peace , man , i'd rather you instead of me
i can never be , play it like a sucker , never me
i'm a g , kept it g , you know where i'm from , 9th ward to the death of me
