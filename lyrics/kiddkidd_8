street fame
this big gun in my pants go boom
like a bad smell it'll air out the room
in the morning right before your kids go to school
who would have knew by lunch time that he’ll be on the news
reporting live from the city of the blues
investigators looking for clues , blues
these hard rhymes come from hard times
my pa was doing life , he caught hard time
somebody died , here come the second line
time to crack a smile , hold your cries inside
you see the pain in her face through a smirk
celebratin' with your face on a shirt
you thought katrina was the worst thing that happened to us ?
you thought that fema money was enough ?
but we gotta get it by all means
trynna survive in the city of new orleans
so fuck yesterday , say yes to the day
because who knows if we gon' see tomorrow anyway
only lord knows if we gonna die today
so we livin' everyday like it’s friday , hey

we livin' everyday like it’s friday , hey
only lord knows if we gon' die today
so we livin' everyday like it’s friday
high grade adidas , anybody lead us
we left the house of blues and then we took it to anita's
my niggas got the heaters , say they comin' out to meet us
we headed to together , said they'll prolly try to cheat us
trippin' off my homie , i’m knowin' that he a rat
he be reachin' out his hand at me , i don’t be reachin' back
be like , oh since you got money now nigga that’s how you act ?
i read the paperwork and , yo homie , i know the facts
i had trouble with the law , but this ain’t the same issue
now i realize we ain’t cut from the same tissue
i was tryin' to trim my mustache , but the lights went off
nigga trynna joke about i used to pipe them off
back in early magnolia when boys done had flippers
when tourin' in ? was four and a half niggas
the hood is all chains , the spirit is gold in it
none made the same , the feeling was authentic
