they'll say you won't be nothing
they'll say you'll miss the shot
nah you ain't warren buffet
you ain't kendrick lamar
they'll say your just as stubborn
as a cemented wall
she comments alcoholic
yet the most sober of all
they say you hide your intentions your emotions is phony
hope you get parkinson's by 20 and die in your 30's
doesn't matter the method but best rotten and lonely
yo this the anthem for the dick riders that's all below me
( facts )
this another one this for all of those hating niggas
they want me boxed in with pity checks
you safe nigga
nah i got hope and dreams to relate but i ain't nigga
you match the words to fit in your pleasures
ya' hip flexor
prolly' getting fucked up after perps , weed and drinks , sour
diesel loud packs of the 8ths is putting these hoes in stretchers
bet they switched the track looking for a man
this ain't a lecture
stop assuming this what they do right after they think they better
than the bro with less education iq and no collective
short term memory but remembers his ethic's wetter
than some new pussy lips reported by " chetyou betcha "
we know good girls only in cartoons
heaven sent a child to get better not monsoons
scratch wounds , penetrate through like a harpoon
introverted tryna' evolve in my cocoon
telling yall this voice a gold mine yo bless you
especially non - believers don't pray to " atchoos "
i'm waiting patiently one day know they go " salu "
like a new recruit i'll be ahead of my squad too
phalanx formation we moving in platoons
and i just
and i just wanna go
and i just wanna go
and i just wanna go
and i just
and i just wanna go
and i just wanna go
and i just wanna go
as i grow and you recite these bars
i hope i can lead on my dreams and not this god damn job
college always the plan but know my time worth more
they say it's the journey , not the destination
though i'm steady racing time
forcing my mind to get into preparation
know the grind will suffice for the sacrifices i'm taking
randomized
whatever demise
formulating coordinates
fuck the xys
team the top echelon
knd trailblazing in tuned with my bros i'm
applying all my data in chips stored the hard rhymes
left it in the software installing the right mods
fixing the load order hustling for coins why
we gotta' shoot back like socom
tired of seeing my niggas on corners for so long
mix that dirty sprite inside the lean man its so strong
neon ice just made my confidence soak up
and i just , ( hey )
and i just wanna go
and i just wanna go
and i just wanna go
and i just
and i just wanna go
and i just wanna go
and i just wanna go
