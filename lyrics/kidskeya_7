donahue i hear you fine
i'm trying to think of something nice to say
about this bad brother put on ice today
he sure was sure of himself but he threw all my good advice away
he thought there may be only one god
he thought stadiums brought jobs
he thought bums failed to follow the crumb trail
and thought of females as a series of thumbnails
he thought people was different on accout of color
the only person crying's his brother white culture
own up , he wasn't no grown - up
no love. he died alone , yup
he was defoe like willem
and when he 'proached my chirren
that's when i had to kill em
he stepped to my baby and he asked me , " what's
the big deal ? " for real , i shot him in gee dash deez nuts
i gave him up like adoption
his bottom had topspin
human auction's been an option since the truman doctrine
( loud pounds on the massive wooden double doors )
what's going on outside this here church ?
what i just heard makes me freeze in my tracks
with knees bent backs but know what ?
it's all of our beeswax
white culture , i know you called five oh
you just bought a ticket to a front row live show
i'm going to send you to your room for real
you'll be my human shield
but before they make all of us celebrate christmas
i guarantee we'll take some of them with us
technology's cold , the knowledge we hold
will last seasons beyond clean seas of blue gold
come on now people , let's go
israel will put you in a box like a disney kidsmeal
for throwing rocks across the border ( hurrican fence )
import orthodox voters to restore order ( americane planes )
read to understand
the old testament's the deed to the land
resist and then bleed in the sand
murder ain't controvercial till it turns to erotica
the star of david takes six lines and so does the swastika
all walls in the world fall
surround around and second flood ?
all yall drown
you came full circle like the lip of the grail
you're the snake i bit on the tip of my tail
look man , you only live once
mind what you say homeboy
