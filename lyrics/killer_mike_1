hardcore g shit , homie , i don't play around
ain't shit sweet bout the peach - - this atlanta , clown
home of the dealers and the strippers and the clubs , though
catch you coming out that magic city with a snub , ho
lurking in the club on tourist motherfuckers
welcome to atlanta - - up your jewelry , motherfucker !
these monkey niggas looking for some luda and jermaine
and all a nigga found was a ruger and some pain
pow , motherfucker , pow ! come up off the chain
pow , motherfucker , pow ! one off in the brain
we some money - hungry wolves , and we down to eat the rich
your bodyguard ain't shit , we strip him like a stripper bitch
these real - ass killers move in silence with violence
the minute it set off , we the motherfucking wildest
how you from atlanta they ain't never speak upon
where everybody got a sack of dope and a gun
and you know just how it go
we ain't playing round with that bullshit
nigga , we ain't let that shit go
when you come here , you better come correct
this real g shit , you gotta show respect
once upon a time in the projects
an o.g. saw a young bun b as a prospect
thought that i would understand the streets from a very young age
so he opened up the g code to the front page
he sat me on the porch , said , " this where little dogs sit "
pointed at the yard , said , " that's where big dogs shit "
he said , " don't leave til your ass get growed
and don't come back til your ass get throwed
whatever you want is whatever you can have
bring the pain and leave em wet , like they soaking in some salve
when you step out on the ave , make sure they wanna see ya
cause being trill is an onomatopoeia
be about it like a g , a hater wanna catch you slipping
try to be a jordan , but settle for a pippen "
player , i ain't even tripping , but i don't really care
cause my pistol's in your face , so put your hands in the air
'96 i'm riding with a pistol grip , banana clip
from simpson road to adamsville , i'm repping this atlanta shit
nigga trying to handle up , let's see can they handle this
a hundred round at em , that ain't no louisiana shit
drinking on that hennessey , blowing on that cannabis
amerikkka's nightmare , trap nigga fantasy
a record full of felonies , searching for a better me
but choppers go off in my hood like iraq , cuba , tel aviv
shoot a nigga , let him bleed - - fuck him , shorty
sucker nigga i'll never be , don't give a fuck about it
quick to run up on that audi , make em get the fuck up out it
nigga better be about it , he deserve it he allow it
what's a coward to a kamikaze ?
he ain't robbed a man , ain't predator or prey ; the law of nature where i stay
i catch you slipping with that k , ain't no illusion , no confusion
better come up off that cake and all that jewelry or you're snoozing
wha - da - da - dang , wha - da - da - da - da - dang
listen to my kimber .45 go bang
bang bang , grindtime , rap game
we the readers of the books and the leaders of the crooks
predators , we eyeballing all of y'all lames
let me fall off , i'm taking all of y'all chains
all of y'all watches and all of y'all cars
well , who he talking to ? all of y'all stars
all of y'all rappers and producers and such
no homo promo , homie , you might get your ass touched
like def jam circa '83 , you get rushed
if you rolling with some winners , then you rolling with us
i know some dumb country niggas , but them niggas ain't me
know they dress and look the part , but them niggas ain't g
i don't make dance music , this is r.a.p
opposite of the sucker shit they play on t.v
