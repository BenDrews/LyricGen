( yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah )
looking for the truth , yeah it's me
everything polo to the floor though , even at the grocery store though
picture perfect , take a photo , and take the pic you biting bitch
and go and stitch a logo ( yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah )
hit you with the quatro , but my girl mercedes
with the audi say that quatro was a two door so a typo
you can put on killer kill , fat boy , or just michael
call me what you want but still never call me rival
they will call you dead and i will call you gone
the lord , sweet jesus , will be weeping calling your ass home
if underground rap royalty is what i’m meant to be
then i will be the shit and you ain't shit to me
we the ones , we the winners , we the champions
champagne at the end of our campaign
spit fire , naked truth like the blue flame
like the blue flame ( yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah )
let me see your hands up if you do the same
caught the plug and we bolt like usain
more money , more power , more butane
burn the motherfucker down , down
life's a bitch so i mack on her immaculate
i don't wear no monkey watches , rolex is too accurate
my rhymes are actually accurate , meaning i don't fiction in my diction
to the masses , this perfection is performed through many practices
like prostitutes on mattresses , this shit just come naturally
easy as osama’s bombers takin many casualties
like columbine i’m down for mine i’m here to kill the faculty
killin them or killin me , this is my soliloquy
iller than the illest beat , i will spit the illest shit
from right here to infinity , till i reach the dirt
i will search the earth endlessly looking for the illest , see
ain’t nobody lyrically as ill as me , 'less eazy - e
come back from a.i.d…s yes
get a beat from e - l - p , ghostwritten from my partner t.i.p
cube and me and we time travel back to 95
jumping in a 63 impala playing cuban linx
yo mike they fucked up putting us together man
yo , i'm a grinch with a grin , i will shit on your kids
get a life , get a grip , get a hold on my dick , bitch , make a wish
i'm a knife , i'm nothing - that's - nicer - than - getting - sliced - up
the switch , the machete , the feti yeti , the shyster
icer , getting - closer - to - christ ya
might just find that the design of your life is an angel hair short of divine love
i stink , i just stuck up a truck that said brinks
i'm a sphinx , snorted so much that my nose just broke off , think
i’m alone again , clutching a loaded glock soaked in chromium
hoping that the thought police just don't bust in my home again
life is tough , you'll get snuffed in the buff
so dystopian , ruff ruff , hear the call of the copper mutts on the hunt
what the fuck , this is not what my mother said i'll become
star - spangler wranglers got my hopes on the run
getting closer now , maybe our society's supposed to drown
middle fingers up on the titanic as it's going down
