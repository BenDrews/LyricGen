this phone isn't the greatest , well , for writing songs
but a vessel nonetheless for fantasies and shrouded thoughts
and as the light comes in and lays in wait across my wall
i gather all i've got and toss the veil once and for all
i'd like to say that it's just fine
could never be a wasted night
5 am before the light
and if you wake up feeling right
just give me a call , it won't be awful
i lose sleep to think of you , i find it awesome
i've been looking pretty hard
but i come up empty
i've been thinking that the only one
for you , is me
baby , baby
babe
laying here in bed , this blue pen and pad in hand
i try to face the fact that i think you're the one
i have just embraced the laughs and all the good fun that we've had
i want to tell you so , but i don't think you'd understand
you sure have a funny way of playing with emotions
mixing up a strange little potion
etched in red and number 9
ten , eleven
and seven minutes in heaven
think i'd kill to spin the bottle with you on the other side
or even be at a party or when you didn't try
to hit on one of my friends only then to pass me by
just give me a call , it won't be awful
i lose sleep to think of you , i find it awesome
i've been looking pretty hard but i
i've been thinking bout the only one
i've been looking pretty hard but i
i've been thinking bout the only one
for you , is me
