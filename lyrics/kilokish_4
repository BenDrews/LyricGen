sitting here wearing acid washed jeans
pressing in to the scenes of all the things i've seen
slight twitch of your skin on my lips
could it be a lie if i think about this ?
hearing sickened thoughts you now
hold my breath counting back a lot
professional no sleep , just you wake
in a place where ghosts start to take shape
i spy with my eye
all the buzz around my hive
when i'm with another guy
you're the one that haunts my mind
one floor beneath me , you're
your ear to the ceiling
feeling all i'm feeling
peaking through hidden meanings , said
and everywhere you are
i fall in love and scared in
the dark i can pretend
you're all that i need
i love the thing you are
holding on to this
lost in the dark and you pretend
you're here to save me
ghost
i mean it , yeah really , i mean it
it's the king you were hoping for
he mean with the open doors
he mean with the text that say " i like you "
smiley face , one with hearts - y eyes
dude who's smiling
man , these toodles island can't be reached
for like a week it's hide and seek
now she wildin' ? but keep it cool , mama
you know the rules , mama
he gets to say you fuckin' cray
you act a fool mama
have your older cousin pull them tools on 'em
anyway , anyway
it's that everyday , everyday
and them pirates in pyrex are giving ladies that baby face ?
you notice
that's why the whole flow precocious
these lubricated magnums to magnum opus
i miss you
