everything to say and nothing left to do
i just wasted 6 months and a day , and all that's left is you
things that aren't done , things that just become acceptable
situations run , a lot of things have grown questionable
looking at my hands , find the lines , i scan all of the things i planned
pick and prove all you've got are girls , living in the world you choose
said you'd play with me today inside your dream house
wait for tomorrow , she'll be barbie , i'll be kicked out
cause she's better , she's better
she's better than me
so why do you keep
on playing me
you say that she's better , she's better
she's better than me
then why do you keep me on my knees
and i'm begging , i'm begging
just leave me
just leave me
just leave me , alone
boy , you just keep on hanging on
you wanna know what lately i can't stand
" girl , just do the best you can "
that phrase sucks
either you're hot or your cold
either you win or you won't
addressing smoke and mirrors still i find you
won't compete for two let me remind you
let the spotlight find you
so there i sat the light was yellow
wax in some wood filled bar
the drinks slid back
i wonder where you're at because i know your heart
you said you'd play with me
inside your dream house
wait for tomorrow , she'll be barbie i'll be kicked out
