just one look at your body girl
i want to move with your body girl
i want to live in your vortex
you know what is coming next
i'm close to your body girl
can i have it ? can i ? please ?
can i have it ? can i ? please ?
i gots to have it , just let me grab it
got an ass so big she gotta drag it
don't mean to come off like a savage
but this the talk when you tricking like it's magic
this is london ( yes ) , this is harrod's ( yes )
missed opportunities could be tragic
and once i bag it , you know i bags it
celine section of your closet look like a parrot
all colors , all shapes , all sizes
bows on 'em knowing how you like surprises ( yeugh )
the world is yours baby , more or less
anything just to lay up in your vortex ( go )
just one look at your body girl
i want to move with your body girl
i want to live in your vortex
you know what is coming next
i'm close to your body girl
can i have it ? can i ? please ?
can i have it ? can i ? please ?
i've never been so ready to be caught off guard
had a menage in a car parked in the yard
she a thug , she keep a weapon , she look angelic
her skin tone is hypnotizing , let you tell it
she doctor romaneli my telly and suck me heavy
she gross heavy , her net worth is ever steady
when she was young i gave her game , now she cold
yea she keep them whips , mama live alone
she took me shopping , we got it popping , her body nice
my time is money , she want to spend it , she got a price
she got a home girl just as bad and uber - rich
the world usually cold , mama you a glitch
my neck hurt from double taking a second look
even though you got money , was hoping you could cook
was hoping you'd make a nigga squirm on the couch
put this in your soul 'til you whisper ouch
just one look at your body girl
i want to move with your body girl
i want to live in your vortex
you know what is coming next
i'm close to your body girl
can i have it ? can i ? please ?
can i have it ? can i ? please ?
