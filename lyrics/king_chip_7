uh , wa - wa - watch your head in my spaceship
me plus two cause i'm in third person ( hey , chip ! )
floating to another destination , resperating
vapors coming from a volcanic eruption , roll up son
and blaze up the cactus , red carpet actress
dropping on you dingleberries who can shart with that shit
don't you start with that chip
literally killing fools by dropping all these syllables
i love watching you niggas lose
and me i just keep growing like a sour diesel plant
i'm mr. let you hold a stack and by the hour need it back
and sprinkle in a little interest and since
had to new play 2k12 with my n's bitch
and swish ! dropping trays on you hot dog mans in the stands
all these rappers is is a bunch of fans ; fucking stans

wa - wa - watch your head in my spaceship
floating to another destination , resperating
vapors coming from a volcanic eruption , roll up son

chilling with your fiance no wonder you ain't seen her
up all night with two girls like " fuck sleep "
she got bbc ( what's that ) booty butt cheeks ( damn )

i'm always sad but some head sure would cheer me up
i'm in the telly with these chicks hoping i get lucky
me and four girls thats eight legs getting octo - pussy
lets wrestle this money , nigga tag team
you gotta get it by any means what does that mean
many eyes watching even when you don't know
some genuine ally , most heartless foe
i know , lets live the happy life and get paid people
the lack of money is the root to all evil ( word )
i'm that off white ufo chilling i'm finna knock in this weed
i gotta make the ceiling drop , so
wa - wa - watch your head in my spaceship
floating to another destination , resperating
