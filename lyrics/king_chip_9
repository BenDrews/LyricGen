bitch i feel good
don't i look stupendous ?
my shine is so endless
ain't shit you can do to end this
even when i'm dead niggas still gon' bump that chip shit
coke white escalade on sixes for you dipshits
so we won't forget this , midwest nigga be the coldest
cleveland is the city where you hustle or you hopeless
and my closet's like a store bitch
only difference is you ain't gon' find this in no store bitch
i'm fresher than your whole clique
g shock over d.c. grinding every time you see me
that louis vuitton complete me
now r.i.p. to ant while i'm out here stunting with keke
i be ridin' super tint
i'm a ghost you never see me
cause i'm up above , i'm in the clouds , i'm rolling up , i'm looking down
chip in the house , y'all stop ya breathin
i'm a superhero , like hancock to cleveland ( nigga )
chorus :
hell yea , that nigga shine all the time but look at him you can tell he from the hood

hold up , roll up , we just smoked 4 blunts and i'm feelin like i should
bitch , i feel good
nigga where the liquor ? where the cups ? where the ladies , where the sluts ? i'm drunk , what
bitch , i feel good
and i'mma stay a fresh , fly nigga doing everything you would if you could
bitch , i feel good
don't i look tremendous ?
damn i feel so splendid
i walk up in yo shindig
higher than the ozone , damn i can float home
just call me when you want some
i'm out here by my lonesome
pack a bape jacket for the winter polo v - neck for the summer
i'm a young hood boss , i do what i wanna
if you tryna fuck with me then you better have some commas
i be with them og's , i'm probably stuntin' with yo fathaaa
problem is you don't want it , nada
my nigga's got hella choppas , you gonna need hella doctaaas
and i rep my city proper
