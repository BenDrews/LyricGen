grew up around some brandy wood chastain niggas/
wasn't no bad neighborhood we played ball and we drank pitchers/
kool aid somebody momma made , our jersey's that can't fit us/
while we wait plot on girls wit bangs , that was the main picture/
alot of those little boys eventually turned gang members/
now i hear bout murder cases involving them same niggas/
i see the eyes of childhood friends and i can't picture/
none of them just hoppin' out and then aiming to flame niggas/
trying not to remember how i last saw em/
i would of expected it how they was looking last autumn/
when i was home to visit , talkin bout my new endeavors/
tryna show my niggas the future but then they past caught em/
us
you don't ever hear about us/
don't nobody ever care about us/
when a young brother gets killed murder don't get found , they don't ever know the whereabouts us/
wonder why they always scared about us/
don't nobody shed a tear about us/
everbody always fear about us/
so i'm trying to make everything clear about us/
