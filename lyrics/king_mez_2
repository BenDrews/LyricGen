the lord gave me my first winter and called out
get used to the cold and the hard drought
and i think that i fell in love with it
cause i feel like my heart never properly thawed out
when i was younger i'd blunder and i would ball out
on all of them new jays i never had thought 'bout
my mama dying , me and my brother crying
but we stayed strong cause that was something that we were taught 'bout
made to be kings though , i feel like it's brought out
reign in me and the rest of my world had been caught out
in it 'till the point when umbrellas were sought out
by our friends and family watching the way we fought out
the jaws of defeat so somethin that you distraught 'bout
wouldn't even phase me , these instrumentals i chalk out
you niggas lazy , and i work like there's no tomorrow
if you think i'm leaving now then your crazy
yeah
nigga , what you 'sposed to be king of ?
uh
matter fact , how you know what a king does ?
yeah
i just know i want that throne
it ain't gotta be the main one
long as don't nobody living got the same one
i born 'bout as remarkable as dry erasers
and broke the norm although society would tried to make us
i was exotic , elementary to college
and all of yall reminding me of reggie the the 90's pacers
and held my own two , even in your grimy places
stepping in your spot with one them " try me " faces
my team only see the dream , you could try to wake us
but we got heart and we be wondering how high it take us
so i ain't caring what your benz will cost
keep your biggest eyes on your girlfriend , tracee ellis ross
cause i naturally attract , no i don't ever floss
they love a gps , yo i ain't ever lost
i thank god how i found myself
other than he no help
wearing my crown myself
got back when - ever i was down myself
so before i kick it with yall i be around myself
it's like
yeah
nigga , what you 'sposed to be king of ?
uh
matter fact , how you know what a king does ?
yeah
i just know i want that throne
it ain't gotta be the main one
long as don't nobody living got the same one
now , i won't say fashion that important
but honestly i learned roman numerals from studying my jordans
walking through the hallways clean every morning
now it's mourning cause it's funerals whenever i'm recording
all my old homies say i'm changing when they mention me
i don't see how , but i knew they would eventually
we wearing crowns , everybody be in dentistry
trying to take from you but for me that's not eventually
or ever. too clever , he never miss like he shoot beams
jesus shuttles worth , living out my hoop dreams
like my pc crash driving on this new scene
riding with my windows down like i'm getting blue screened
everybody loving it children to old folks
and especially the women that smile is cold coke/
no joke
all raleigh baby even when i'm touring for my city
stand up , wale
no falorin , king mezatron
