what the name of my team be
fresh heirs believe me
only kings in my circle boy
instrumental they feed me
women from your television trying be where my seed be
we be like pardon , but no hoes in the garden
tv watered from the rain that i started when i departed
i left the average niggas who wondering where they heart is
equivalent to none like one minus one
or the catholic women who skin don't see sun
yeah , i could have been arrogant , but i was humble by my tears
always was bright , but now my candle chandeliers
i was supposed to get degrees , live life as an engineer
but surpassing all of my peers , got my mind on damier , yeah
elegant women and they friends , in my 700 benz
they wondering what i spend , i'm wondering 'bout my spins
they said i get my rank up when i'm adding onto my sins
but i really don't see the stripes like the bottom of my 10's
but then when i think again , i won't be caught up in this trance
but how do i know for sure , it's different when you see them ends
my nigga go for broke , only got one life to live
i mean i know you got your girl but now every city it's some tens
in every hotel lobby , who know your name and probably came
so you can get 'em naughty
and beat it up til' it may weather , no arturo gatti
i mean it's tempting , these are the fruits of my labor
but i contradict , telling her respect the body
but about that quick , baby girl that fit , but my mind on my paper
margiela killer , louis , louboutin all in my favour
but my girl better have some j's , it be that or the vapors
bonnie & clyde type , stride committing our capers
infrared lasers at this evil minded enterprise
princess says only into guys prince is only in her thighs
to all the ignorant entertainers that's helping our demise
even when a fool hold his peace he considered wise
ain't no need to flow nigga , rain says the weatherman
leave that job to me pimping , flash flood veteran
never ride with niggas only trip with who they better than
imagining the crowns on my sisters and my brethren
i'm looking up in the night sky , trying to find my stars
passing by them dealerships , trying to find my cars
but now i see you artists and question your moral targets
i won't judge you but i sentence you rappers behind my bars
and that's life dog , somebody in my city won't make it through the night dog
and i'm supposed to be throwing money , that's right dog ?
i mean , alright dog
i walk into the corner shop
somewhere i never been before
i ain't tryina die no more
and right now i
like it's never been before
i'm ready i'm sure
see the allure
