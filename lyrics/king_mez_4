over paper with pyramids on their back
people hold chrome , with small cylinders attack
bet you that they red octagon you in your tracks
pull off in the whip , with the diamond on the back
and the sunroof top , thinking they gon' be a star
when their hood get hot , no relation to your car
but they won't be going far , they just make up dope dares
after l's in their circle , then they start to smoke squares
pentagon chilling , politicians don't care
long as the office with the oval can get the good glares
so the king and the queen never really understand
why their hex ain't gone , and this is what the hood bears
no hearts , they hate on the living
so they try angles , that can hinder our vision
six by eight , rectangular prisons
i know we better shape up when making decisions
it's like that...
( and they keeping me boxed in )
( and they keeping me boxed in like )
( and they keeping us boxed in )
( why they keeping us boxed in like ? )
seven digits for your people with the hammers , man
blam , cannons flash , sixteen in the handle , man
one in the chamber that'll shoot , like the camera man
when you done , only need three for the ambulance
where i'm from , they rep that five with a passion , man
move white , like avalanche , fiends at a trance
they buy the tens and the twenties and the fifties too
cause they only want the highs man , like the madden stance
uh , now you ready to vacate
cops tried to stop him , the last one ate eight
to the face , four five dispersed , and make waste
five - 0 get divided like weight to make base , uh
hope they get em a new grind
only reaching eighteen when gripping them two nines
why i want to for ? like star on lakers
forty ounces instead of acres and yall dudes fine
like that...
( and they tell me my days numbered )
( and they tell me my days numbered like )
( and they tell us our days numbered )
( why they tell us our days numbered like ? )
my hue , the same as huey newton's was
black pride and gold crowns , i'm shooting for
cause all my city need it , i want em on the dean's list
and hope they get their vanilla papers to hit the scene with
not for the dutch right , brown paper crutch light
blow purple till the room gray , that's a tough sight
when i know they could be read cause they such bright
individuals , people would read if they just write
they wanna make your block light up , like billie jean
push white through your system , like midi keys
take green from the victims , with the silver things
make sure that they blew up , by any means
color numbers shape , so the children take rule
hope they take mind , that way they won't have to take tool
uh , we giving you the playskool
so you won't play dead when learning to play cool
like that...
( to all my pretty brown mothers )
( shout out to all my white brothers )
( to all my strong black mothers )
( they define us by our color like... )
