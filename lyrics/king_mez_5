comish' , what it do ?
what they want from , what they want from me and all my niggas tho ?
raleigh , north carolina , we knocking down the door
east coast and southern flow , whenever i feel as tho
never no point in imitating i was thinking yall should know
i grew up watching them chevys bending corners , awesome glow
candy paint and leather seats and wood grain finish on all the doors
and jordans on pretty women , bad girls , lord knows
cookouts on the block was 'bout equivalent to award shows
now i see that coming , oh , enemies build rapport so
when they see me , it won't make em feel it all in they torso
even though they should cause nothing changed , but the numbers on my door so
if you thinking bitter with me , you foreclosed
young king mezatron , ready for war , my sword shows
back to back platinum plaques on my wall , in my dreams , how my decor go
after that back to rap , good with all my cream and my reward tho
i'mma be reinvesting , pay attention , these is lessons from a king boy
what they want from , what they want from me and all my niggas tho ?
all we thinking is get that dough , never what they taught us , that's all we know
if you throwing hands , understand , you better not hit that floor
pocket full of cash , in your pants you better not let that show
if you pride your intellect , then i suggest you just let that glow
cause in the world we living in , if you suppress it you will not blow
stokley carmichael resemble , my mental and sentences leave my dental
so you be stuck with my pencils , mementos , because i'm passionate
fly as well , something you never should try to sell
they often do , but when you be imitating homie i can tell
we call the crew , women with gucci , louie v , or in chanel
always gaining interest in us , guess we good investments , well
how could you blame em tho ? its expected tho , where did i change the flow
and game em tho , i got it perfected , that's any lane i go
only hang with kings , very few in this world
but i know i'm worthy of my title , if you may not know
