charm is deceitful and beauty is vain
said a woman with aids
homies used to call her the train
when addressing instead of calling her name
she tried to stop , but she backboarding all the squares , calling the game
her decision is she don't love herself , all of its pain
thats the world that we living in , she dont like giving in
but she's marked with the heaviest stains
stood outside , hoping to wash away with the rain
but it won't though , and she don't know
how to get a clue on what she gotta do
for making sure it don't show
cuz it ain't romance whenever she come around
matter fact , no chance , they hopin she gettin down
she don't know what she worth , wandering on this earth
young black queen , im hoping she get a crown , found
baby me and you can make it to the stars
long as you think you can make it with your scars
and i know it get hard
just make sure you remember who you are
so im at the house party with two of my friends
and i go into the room trying to get on my phone
and its funny cuz she come into the room that im in
and i didn't give a look like i'm trying to bone
you see ? even when them women jock barely i was skeetin
i didn't want them leaving , bereaving , about them meetings
some teaching , so i be teaching , tell em to love their features
homies think im cutting , im in the room and im reaching for her self respect
she tellin me about her self neglect
and how a couple niggas hitting had to no protect
and how she only think she worth the worth that niggas set
and just to keep she had no problem to give them sex
and her abortion and how the thought of it get her vexed
and how she itchin and knowin she should be getting checked
she's interrupted by a yell behind the door , homies raw
mez hurry up my nigga cuz i get her next
baby me and you can make it to the stars
long as you think you can make it with your scars
and i know it get hard
just make sure you remember who you are
worry he won't love you for you girl ?
do whatever he want you to do girl ?
but he always out chillin' with new girls
you need to worry about looking out for you girl
tears in her eyes , she had started to cry
then she bust out the door for the people to sigh
dipped out in the whip , party wondering why
among the guest was a fella , who was one of the guys
that did the dirty
he was the first of them all , being flirty
way before she was loose , she was nerdy
but he wanted to body , baby girl was pretty
but yo it hurt him
to know he was the start of her being wicked
so he rushed out after her , all black acura
knew where she resided and she kicked it
but on the way to the neighborhood he saw her maxima
engine still running with the door wide open
walked into the woods and to god he hopin'
she was good til he found the letter she had never spoken
with his name on it , next to the gun still smokin , like that..
