through the glasses the wine be flashion/ and
all the food come in tiny rations/ plus
all the ladies gone be fine and dancing/
but i'mma get to it a timely fashion timeley fashion/
to the labels tryna sign me fastest/ cause
they can tell that im gone be lastin/ yo
though i want it wit a timeless passion/
i know i'mma get there in a timely fashion
see i see the game like a party/
cosigns have the same effects as bacardi/
take it to the head you may never leave your bed cause you drunk off coulda beens and hardlys/ yea
i been known to handle bars like a harley/
even after feedin me compliments i be starving/
when i get to it i may never leave the game , establish longevity ill be farving/ number fo/
and ill be teaching rookies anything they wanna know/
og's did the same for me , so i wanna show/
that same love/
and show strength like zangief in the game/
but it'll all come in time , won't be rushing tho/
they mighta said i wouldn't make it theyll be hushin tho/
alot people told me they havnt seen such a glow/
or worked as merry since the now legendary were they teamates/
and i won't be gettin comfy so/
errybody callin my phone like my nigga/
you need to hurry up cause its girls and mad liquor/
but to be really honest , that ain't really the reason that im goin , i just wanna feed my fam wit my figgas/
and , use words to breed some rad scholars/
teach the next generation over cuffin mad dollars/
gucci louis and keep my lady in mad prada/
i would really rather just drop gems like mancala/
but
they sayin that ain't the rapper thing to do tho/
get gold fronts show teeth like kujo/
be flashy , you know/
so they know its numbers in yo hand like uno/
i mean
thats cool i appreciate your offer/
but if i do decide to get jewelry it be armor/
cause if you gone floss just be ready the scope or be brushed from the teeth of lady karma/
