yeah
fresh heir
yeah ( x3 )
uhh
i need a few classic albums , and a couple mil before i put my feet up
just to dust them off , i don't recline i keep my seat up
nigga be thinking having broads mean it bout to heat up
i want my spot and dimes never pay the parking meters
labels slaving niggas crazy thing they really need , us
time to eat , niggas ain't waiting for waiters to seat us
comfortable rap niggas better hope that they feed us
call me number two but i'm the leader , guess i'm derek jeter
why you think they rolling weed up , trying to be g'ed up
stereotypical depictions little niggas eat up
thats why instead of trying to fight the kid when they get beat up
these coward rappers niggas talking murder never seen nuttin'
not many kings but the world astonished when they meet one
put they hands up in abundance and hope to greet us
only give praises to god , even if you need us
what we do can help you through but still the devil could defeat us
parts of my city in the dark , i pray with all my might
we was young but niggas never kept the drama light
went to a party niggas shot up at apollo heights
she came to get me i was fearing for my momma's life
bottom hall walking home one of them college nights
nigga walk up put a barrel in my line of sight
make a mockery of religion cause shit was easy for you
you ain't never have to pray to god that you don't die tonight
leave the club , bloods everywhere , they trying to fight
trump for the china white and they mental like dynamite
to the point our conversations had eventually gotten like
'i saw that nigga yesterday , ' homies leaving us every night
true stories , all i tell is true stories
when i hear the lies there's nothing they can do for me
seen a lot at twenty three , ain't a lot thats new for me
if you can't tell the difference , then its wild to you surely
but i ain't really appalled
i see the future in the crystal that they cooking , so part of me methanol
most of me is for y'all
most of me want to haul
all the problems in the world on my back i hope i don't fall
but some of me want it all
spring , summer and fall
i woulda been the running type but piece of me know to crawl
the rest of me want to ball
get a car shipped to me
if it come while we at dinner
please pardon me for this call , my nigga
huh , let me get this call
should went to canada and wrote this in montreal
man wanted just that my frozen heart ain't never thaw
i ain't mention winter prior cause the winter is my dog
hard to do good , this world wrapped up in sin
you try to change it for better , they pulling you back again
kennedy wanted more , you seen what happened to him
and we like ink the way we back in the pen
over bullshit , shorties load up full clips
laying in pulpits , elementary school shit
some people born into money , now thats some cool shit
we inherit death , thats some cruel shit
