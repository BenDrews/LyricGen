watch how you talk to me about what you know me
never trust him much , i doubt you my homie
got advice , i doubt that it's for me
no one tips on getting money from you niggas
i doubt you could show me
that homie lead till they see you with the range
well i'm reggie miller ; pull up with the range
they don't believe till they see you with your chain
what i been such a warrior
since early on i would bump notorious , glorious
felt euphoria , southern rap niggas call more of you up
hating already ? we starting up
least wait till i open the ferrari up
i'm sorry about the past homies
but i'm willing to bet that you sorrier
am i right ? well i bet i am ;
just chill till the red - eye land
you ain't the best ; never said i am
but i'm part of the argument
before i'm dead i am
but i keep my soul , my nigga they sell those too
yeah , they say heaven only know , but some of us hell knows too
and that's real
hol' up hol' up , hol' up ; i know i deserve a moment
made the beat and my flow steady swerving on it
a lot of the niggas that want to talk now , they were curving on it
call that magic man , now i feel like ervin on it
hid lights on my benzo , make it hard to observe the doughnuts
so rj dunk with the white on black
by the time i get that , man the world will know me
cut real deep like a surgeon on me
never did act like a burden on me
everybody be looking at me different that me
and you too girl , now yeah i know you want it
why you lying , you know you want it
try to hide it now but i won't matter
by the way you wave , you already show it
always knew i'd rap the flows , even at the lunch table , i'd catch the o's
so i knew it was on the way
that homie lead till they see you with the range
well i'm reggie miller ; pull up with the range
they don't believe till they see you with your chain
why you lying
always knew
no tutorials...
look , this song ain't about no suv
it's about the way you see me
and i , pretty soon , want to grow into
everything a nigga said i can't be
like it's impossible , nah my g
say they got my lock , but i got my key
and they lie to you , if they told you that
i don't do this for raleigh
that homie lead till they see you with the range
well i'm reggie miller ; pull up with the range
they don't believe till they see you with your chain
that homie lead till they see you with the range
well i'm reggie miller ; pull up with the range
they don't believe till they see you with your chain
