blest pæan , come , propitious to my pray'r ,
illustrious pow'r , whom memphian tribes revere ,
slayer of tityus , and the god of health ,
lycorian phœbus , fruitful source of wealth .
spermatic , golden - lyr'd , the field from thee
receives it's constant , rich fertility.
titanic , grunian , smynthian , thee i sing ,
python - destroying , hallow'd , delphian king :
rural , light - bearer , and the muse's head ,
noble and lovely , arm'd with arrows dread :
far - darting , bacchian , two - fold , and divine ,
pow'r far diffused , and course oblique is thine.
o , delian king , whose light - producing eye
views all within , and all beneath the sky :
whose locks are gold , whose oracles are sure ,
who , omens good reveal'st , and precepts pure :
hear me entreating for the human kind ,
hear , and be present with benignant mind ;
for thou survey'st this boundless æther all ,
and ev'ry part of this terrestrial ball
abundant , blessed ; and thy piercing sight ,
extends beneath the gloomy , silent night ;
beyond the darkness , starry - ey'd , profound ,
the stable roots , deep fix'd by thee are found.
the world's wide bounds , all - flourishing are thine ,
thyself all the source and end divine :
'tis thine all nature's music to inspire ,
with various - sounding , harmonising lyre ;
now the last string thou tun'ft to sweet accord ,
divinely warbling now the highest chord ;
th' immortal golden lyre , now touch'd by thee ,
responsive yields a dorian melody.
all nature's tribes to thee their diff'rence owe ,
and changing seasons from thy music flow
hence , mix'd by thee in equal parts , advance
summer and winter in alternate dance ;
this claims the highest , that the lowest string ,
the dorian measure tunes the lovely spring .
hence by mankind , pan - royal , two - horn'd nam'd ,
emitting whistling winds thro' syrinx fam'd ;
since to thy care , the figur'd seal's consign'd ,
which stamps the world with forms of ev'ry kind.
hear me , blest pow'r , and in these rites rejoice ,
and save thy mystics with a suppliant voice.
