bacchus i call , loud - sounding and divine ,
fanatic god , a two - fold shape is thine :
thy various names and attributes i sing ,
o , first - born , thrice begotten , bacchic king :
rural , ineffable , two - form'd , obscure ,
two - horn'd , with ivy crown'd , euion , pure.
bull - fac'd , and martial , bearer of the vine ,
endu'd with counsel prudent and divine :
triennial , whom the leaves of vines adorn ,
of jove and proserpine , occultly born.
immortal d√¶mon , hear my suppliant voice ,
give me in blameless plenty to rejoice ;
and listen gracious to my mystic pray'r ,
surrounded with thy choir of nurses fair.
