raised on songs and stories , heroes of renown
the passing tales and glories that once was dublin town
the hallowed halls and houses , the haunting childrens' rhymes
that once was part dublin in the rare auld times
( chorus )
ring - a - ring - a - rosey , as the light declines
i remember dublin city in the rare auld times
my name it is sean dempsey , as dublin as can be
born hard and late in pimlico , in a house that ceased to be
by trade i was a cooper , lost out to redundancy
like my house that fell to progress , my trade's a memory
and i courted peggy dignam , as pretty as you please
a rogue and a child of mary , from the rebel liberties
i lost her to a student chap , with skin as black as coal
when he took her off to birmingham , she took away my soul
( chorus )
the years have made me bitter , the gargle dims me brain
for dublin keeps on changing , and nothing seems the same
the pillar and the met have gone , the royal long since pulled down
as the grey unyielding concrete , makes a city of my town
( chorus )
so fare thee well sweet anna liffey , i can no longer stay
and watch the new glass cages , spring up along the quay
my mind's too full of memories , too old to hear new chimes
and once was part of dublin , in the rare auld times
( chorus x2 )
