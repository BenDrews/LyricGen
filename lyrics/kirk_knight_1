i know , i know , i know
you gone say you feel me
i do not believe you
tell me what you know about the struggle , nigga
that shit do not leave you
not if you a man
have you ever had to cool a nigga head
when he had a fucking burner in his hand
( i know , i know , i know )
shit like that is normal , southside call it lamron
damn near made it formal
red line like a portal
i been taking l's , i been smoking l's
you can catch this l in 2k
like i took about three painkillers
i don't really feel it today , i'm moody
i mean lately a nigga been overwhelmed
i do not expect you to understand
like the kind of mood that will match overcast
or when a pitch nigga throwing shade underhanded
i mean bases loaded
this ain't softball , holes in your clothes
these ain’t moth balls
switch the style up
it was south pole
and now it's south paw
you can fight me now !
i know , i know , i know
you know , he know , she know
man , what the fuck do we know
man , what the fuck do we know
y'all motherfuckers can't feel me
y'all don't feel me
y'all motherfuckers can't feel me
y'all don't feel me
working with no ceilings
deep within emotions
they gone say i'm in my feelings
they gone say i'm in my feelings
y'all motherfuckers can't feel me
y'all don't feel me
y'all motherfuckers can't feel me
y'all don't feel me
i know , i know , i know
you gone say you feel me
i stop make believe
and if i go broke , they got homeless rights to give me
what was the odds after every single evening
i’m just proceeding my nigga
what is your status , don't see characters
i see these escolar twisting
more aliens i know i needed distance
ever had that homie that didn't listen
contemplating life , only cut wrists
too much ridiculous
why i gotta talk my homie out of death
taking baby steps
step on the floor
crawling on my knees
crushing all these dreams
blinded so hard
i had a step that was forcing my all in , i’m appalled
shit gettin' blown at the park
side
user of the words or the gun i might smite
uh , live do or die
never settle for the less
can't afford suit and tie
my man’s still deaf on suicide
forced to keep itself and scrutinize
i don't wanna jeopardize everything i built
because of people i socialized with
this is where i from
but the truth is , me and them have different types of idolizing
i know , i know , i know
you know , he know , she know
man , what the fuck do we know
man , what the fuck do we know
y'all motherfuckers can't feel me
y'all don't feel me
y'all motherfuckers can't feel me
y'all don't feel me
working with no ceilings
deep within emotions
they gone say i'm in my feelings
they gone say i'm in my feelings
y'all motherfuckers can't feel me
y'all don't feel me
y'all motherfuckers can't feel me
y'all don't feel me
i know , i know , i know
y'all motherfuckers can't feel me
y'all motherfuckers can't feel me
you know , he know , she know
working with no ceilings
working with no ceilings
deep within emotions
motions....
y'all motherfuckers can't feel me
i know , i know , i know
you know , he know , she know
man , what the fuck do we know
man , what the fuck do we know
y'all motherfuckers can't feel me
y'all don't feel me
y'all motherfuckers can't feel me
y'all don't feel me
working with no ceilings
deep within emotions
they gone say i'm in my feelings
