it would last , breaking bad
but it's out of the charm , you holdin' my arm
tryna go far
but you got tendencies
like a maid , making sure your man is up to par
i got a grip as a shooting star
i would board your body but it's truly scarred
by them other dicks

i know you screamin' that you hate the fact
& my faith to you is just act
you test my love

just want a menage or a late night skeet
no facade , get high
reach the sky with her
but ain't no trust
cuz this is just a fuck
& you think im scum
& you say im young
say i don't know what a relationship is
just how wet the clit is
shit , get out my business
i like my own space
said i like ya but you play it cool
hold me down , when i need a boo
& un - need - able
& i don't need a boo
& you say im wack
but you love it when i hit it from the back
& to that changes , fatal attraction
you hate me & i hate you
i love you foo , i love you boo
cuz you my type of bitch
