yeah , yeah
shit i seen and eh
with the figure s , nigga
it’s kirk killa , shit !
i smoke backwoods and dutchies
the extra dusty young fly motherfucker
oh my god it must be — triple - k cutter
brooklyn life - and - deather
cross me , be the first and last like alpha and omega
so , what's the dilemma hon' ?
niggas with hella guns
residence medieval so watch my umbrella , uh
bright like candella with statements like mandela , uh
stank - face still stainless , it's whatever bruh
think and lead a coffin right there , we headin' awol
my getaway , it's that stick shift call it 8 ball
hopped in the hot seat i'm drunk nigga
leave you slump nigga
don't get dumb nigga
i know it's time for change so we snatch quicker
not measly shit i seen as a little figure
i dare some
to try to flash clothes and fair guns
because where i'm from for amusement shoot the fair one
the mind of a brooklyn nigga
go brooklyn , go brooklyn , go brooklyn
brooklyn's in the house !
i said nowadays brooklyn ain't the same
and life's a scam and i'd rather be paid
credit card by that fuckin' boa
but if you want a couple stacks than you're going to chase
if you play your cards right than you're heading the fast way
and them niggas in the clash just fillin' up plates
so i just keep on , reachin' , lying to my teachers
with the hammer pants , i keep security cards in my sneakers
i'm heading for the trust funds , bonds , and planned speeches
all i ever knew was a atf procedure
transaction , gotta eat , serving all the status
no fan could catch me that bmw fashioned
black tinted , mac 10 , oh yes the bitches
circle round scan them pockets for the double digits
and these things around me make my wants money , bitches
but my conscious told me just look back and listen
the mind of a brooklyn nigga
go brooklyn , go brooklyn , go brooklyn
brooklyn's in the house !
now i ain't gonna tell your fuckin' ass you owe me motherfuckin' money ! now strip motherfucker strip ! strip ! come on. now everybody know that money is the root of all evil. i'll show y'all how the loot work
