i consider myself a storyteller
i'm a writer , i'm a producer , i'm an author
i'm an actor , i'm a director
let be able to go into these different worlds is very powerful for me
so i love to work
i don't know any other way
part of it in the beginning was
i was running from poverty
i thought
everything's messed up
i don't know what to do , where to go or look
who i am ?
has to be
pure
i'll get it , just patience
work , earn , learning
will he ever see to perceive me as other than pure
so check me in god ( check me in , check me in )
check me in god
to your gates , to your heaven , to your hymns god
check me in , check me in
check me in god
the streets dissect me by the limb
check me in god ( check me in , god )
to your gates , to your heaven , yo your hymns god
check me in , check me in
give me your soul , give me your beat
give me everything i need just to unleash the beast
darkest angel , but i come in peace
i flew over heads , i'm a traveling man
one sick motherfucker with a way fare plan
to eliminate the feeling of the devil on my shoulders
i remain a soldier , starving artist with composure
if x marks the spot , give me three x's
bare strength , hands like i hold them
more or less i mold them
i even turn my actions into diamonds if i smould 'em
not a simpson , but finally felt what home is
and my spirit needs fine tuning
a caveman and i'm finally a conan
ayo peter , i'm also a family guy
so please , would you just let me in the house tonight
i know the night is young and a nigga was still taking baby steps
until the light , struck and everything became radiant
so check me in god ( check me in , check me in )
check me in god
to your gates , to your heaven , to your hymns god
check me in , check me in
check me in god
the streets dissect me by the limb
check me in god ( check me in , god )
to your gates , to your heaven , to your hymns god
check me in , check me in
i'm just pleading for the right , my nigga
to walk heaven grasses and be alright , my nigga
narrow my vessel like a vascular constrictor
i'm the agent that was sent from rags to riches
to rise in pitches , but life's hard
i could really argue my linguistics of this shit
who really are you to judge a man
tryna make it in this day and age , g
don't expect silver spoons the way i was raised
tear ducts dried up , some people walk in the rain
others get wet , i show you how to walk with the pain
imperfect world , i'm an angel , the same
same sin that was on paul trying to make a name
look , now i'm a ghostwriter like i'm nicolas cage
and the enemies and friends i couldn't mention a thing
i left behind a whole life just to turn a new page
now i'm just trying to show you the ways
so check me in god ( check me in , check me in )
check me in god
to your gates , to your heaven , to your hymns god
check me in , check me in
check me in god
the streets dissect me by the limb
check me in god ( check me in , god )
to your gates , to your heaven , yo your hymns god
check me in , check me in
but it has to be pure , be infinite
like me and me
but it has to be pure , be infinite
like me and me
