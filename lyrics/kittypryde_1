get out of my roooooooom bleh
once upon a time , i spied on you
bud light lime in my hand and i stand over there
and listen to your little lies about your cool life
you say she will be your wife , but i am
whites red , irises brown , and your eyes wide
you apologize to me when i see you do a line , but like
i'm open - minded and it's fine
i don't do the shit , but i don't really mind it
i'm not heartless but i'm hardened , a rotten tooth
it's my party , couldn't cry if i wanted to
and the more you taunt me the more i think i'm wanting you
and ever since , you're the prince and i'm the one that's haunting you
now you're tryna dip , without me
but i'm the princess , read my lip , it's pouty
and the sky is lookin kinda cloudy so maybe you should stay inside
and you and i can get a little rowdy
lordy , shorty you're a 10 and i wait for your drunk dials at 3 : 30 am
i love them
excuse me , you're a hell of a boy , your cigarette breath , well i thoroughly enjoy it
lordy , shorty you're a 10 and i wait for your drunk dials at 3 : 30 am , i love them
so call me sober when you're ready , not goin steady , but babe i planned our wedding already
i don't care how long it takes to get you after me i wrote our names on my binder
and everybody laughed at me
but it really doesn't matter , you are radder and cooler
a hooligan and my flattery makes me look like a fool again
you are a tool again , but you're the one that i've chosen
i'm not familiar with this type of devotion
i used to be a pimp without emotion but now you got me simpin
and singing the frank ocean and thinkin bout you
ooh no no no , i been thinkin bout you , ooh no no no
i been thinkin bout you , do you think about me ?
lordy , shorty you're a 10 and i wait for your drunk dials at 3 : 30 am , i love them
so call me sober when you're ready , not goin steady , but babe i planned our wedding already
lordy , shorty you're a 10 and i wait for your drunk dials at 3 : 30 am , i love them
so call me sober when you're ready , not goin steady , but babe i planned our wedding already
