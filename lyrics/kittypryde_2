i don't think i'll make it hanging here another day
i wanna get spirited away
every time i'm near it i run clear the other way
and disappear and never stay , i'm spirited away
i don't think i'll make it hanging here another day
i wanna get spirited away
i run clear the other way
i disappear and never stay
i'm out on the balcony , i can see the ocean
i'm practicing alchemy on you , pour a potion
i conjure a spell , wish you well
i can say i'm joking when i call my city hell
tossing dollars and pennies in wishing wells
and i promised i'd be gone and forget it by 2012
and i thought if i got out i'd never visit
when you talk i think you're all a bunch of bitches
and never listen
i hide in closets , the smallest that i can fit in
getting restless , i fuss and i fidget and
i feel so grey in the city , it's a prison
i just wanna shine my colors on the walls like a prism but
no one answers when i ask how their work's been
or smiles back on the street or at the church and
i don't speak and i don't care , it isn't worth it
soon i'll be meek enough to inherit the earth but
i don't think i'll make it hanging here another day
i'll get spirited away
every time i'm near it i run clear the other way
i disappear and never stay , i'm spirited away
i don't think i'll make it hanging here another day
i get spirited away
disappear and never stay
bitter and sad is how i'm feeling like i'm celery
and i could draw the pattern on my ceiling from my memory
i grow balls to show up at my old fave places
deep breaths kitty , very brave face , chest out
remind myself i deserve this
even though they'll be whispering that i'm worthless
my mama says to show 'em what i'm made of
but they already know it all and that's what i'm afraid of
i build up my powers in tower 2 and devour you cowards
i'm spending hours and hours on sims and sour patch kids
i'm hidden in bows for my hair and shiny pairs of shoes
bitch , i'll embarrass you when i'll be in paris soon cause
i don't think i'll make it hanging here another day
i get spirited away
every time i'm near it i clear the other way
i disappear and never stay , i'm spirited away
i don't think i'll make it hanging here another day
i wanna get spirited away
and disappear and never stay
and disappear and never stay
