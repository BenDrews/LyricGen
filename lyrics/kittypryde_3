hey , be careful with that , no , stop
the monster in my closet fought the one under my bed
and in the middle of the battle i said
" don't tell my dad or he'll probably get mad
and he'll stop payin' for all the adderall "
i don't want that , i don't wanna get fat at all
in a room with the admiral , the bruiser brigade
it's been a really , really messed up week , month , day
and i just rack up the hate , it comes as fast as a play count
and i'm just gonna chill on the playground
while you spend your whole day down in the depths of the net
wanna bet ? it upsets you
you want me to fade out and i am the rap game pest , get your raid out
and i got your ass obsessed , no shame
i'm not really interested in hittin' the tip top
and i got you mad but you're watchin'
you say , " this little white girl is ruinin' hip hop "
i say , " damn right ! " and take a lick of the ring pop and smile
no way near the tip top
and i got you mad , but you're watchin'
you say , " this white girl is ruinin' hip hop "
i say , " damn right ! " and take a lick of the ring pop and smile
i'm the kitten kaboodle and now i'm all over google
and i am very youtubeable
with the beautiful lou beats and hideous cuticles
you hide out in the cubicle and ponder whose daughter i am
a diabolical plot of the industry and
we didn't think anybody would be into me and umm
i don't give a crap , i get happy
enough to have your favorite rapper twitterin' at me
and a&r sayin' i could be a star
and i'm way stressed , i just wanted a betsey j dress
and some time off from claire's so i could chill for a while
so i take a lick of the ring pop and smile
