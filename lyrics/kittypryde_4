i don't have an opening , i guess i'll go ahead
i'm bo peep , no sheep , just white dresses
red tresses and white laundry
i sing a song to my zombie army , i sing
" who do you voodoo bitch ? you can't harm me
who do you voodoo bitch ? you can't harm me "
you can't charm me , i'm a patrician
i'm singin pounds in the trashcan , kitty do the dishes
singin pounds in the trashcan , kitty do the dishes
and i love ny cuz there's so many bridges to jump off
the backyard's where you get dumped off
lil kim wanna let the hive pump off
i just wanna drag you through the marigolds
i just wanna preach you every parable
wiz is black and yellow and i'm white and fucking terrible
i'm out in rocking chairs in front of cracker barrel
with a red nose like a character of carols at christmas
i hear " miss kitty , come here and sniff this "
but i just wanna be like doom with it
i wanna kill a beat and resuscitate it in two minutes
no committee of clones to ride cock
and say , " leave kitty alone "
they're chris crock to me
you don't know why all the boys flock to me ?
bitch , draw your eyebrows on then talk to me
draw your eyebrows on then talk to me
you don't know why all the boys flock to me ?
you don't know why all the boys flock to me ?
you don't know why i get blogged ?
you're unable to discern if i'm the wunderkind or underdog
so fuck it all , i'm the wonderwall
i'm the one to call , i'm a slab of muscle under fat
i'm in battle like a thundercat
i'm a thunder kitty , what a shitty little pun
but that's why i need a gun , a gat , something like that
i get bottles thrown and shot a lot
i think my body needs an otter box
i'm hot a lot , i gotta get some otter pops
i'm the optimus , i boss around the autobots
and i bounce in my own crowd
i need to get the fuck out of my hometown
and i bounce in my own crowd , bounce in my own crowd
bounce bitch , bounce bounce
bounce in my own crowd , bounce in my own crowd
bounce bitch , bounce bounce
you're unable to discern if i'm the wunderkind or underdog
so fuck it all , i'm the wonderwall
