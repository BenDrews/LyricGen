i should be less creepy and less easy sounding
please can you freeze me up zero degrees freak me
even though i'm greasier than pizza
more tweezers i need , jesus , my teeth they just need bleaching
i'll be sweet to you , always free , i can leave with you
birds and bees are a mystery , teach me ?
with books thicker than tolstoy , descriptive
and most boys would liquor me up , poison trickery
but i predict that you’re gonna see me and split
cause you’re dirty sprite , hi , i’m kitty , your gold teeth are the shit ,
and i’m mary jane and you’re petey , in the street , i’ll invert you
so greet me with kisses iconic and sweet
we aren’t even acquainted but i’m gonna wait and listen ,
i really want you to want me , i really wanna take off with you
really want you to want me , cause you’re flexing in the trap
every time i hear your voice i have relapse
ay shawty , let me holler at you
ay shawty , let me holler at you
ay shawty
ay shawty , let me holler at you
ay showty , let me holler at you
ay
first off , i don't love 'em , i bag 'em , i gut 'em
and , b , i don't know where i put 'em
angie teresa look like jalisa from bet , she came to see you
i'm pleased to pieces but i ain't see you , no
yeah , you see me at the party , i see you at the party
you said , you don’t like to talk at the party
like i’m a fireball at a party , c'mon
i can sit and smoke a ciga - cigar - gar from cuba - cuba - ba
this shit ain’t a mai tai , it’s dirty sprite , show you right
sure you really really really really wanna be my lover ?
say you wanna go home and watch cartoons ?
yeah , me too , but not with you
ride around town like a mobster do
high off weed and lots of booze
meat in her tail like a lobster do
and she dominican too , so i ain't fucking with you
listen , mami , you really want me to want you ?
then don't want me , i got you
you really want me to want you ?
turn into a pack of bogeys
it’s cool you thought you could know me but...
