their stares level me , the devil made me do it
when really i've been craving for days to misbehave with you
and i know if we're caught you're not the type to save me
but i'll be brave , and take the blame if we can misbehave
their stares level me , the devil made me do it
when really i've been craving for days to misbehave with you
and i know if we're caught you're not the type to save me
but i'll be brave , and take the blame if we can misbehave
a scapegoat , i'll tell em it was me
when we stole your brother's car with the little rubber key
and my mother , she'll blubber to the fuzzes and she'll plea
" he's the bad seed , it wasn't my kathryn - leigh " please
pardon me , but i did it
i'm more mischievious than previously thought and i'll admit it
and the minute that you dare me to , i'm scared but i'm committed
call me square , it isn't fair how bad you make me wanna fit in
it's hazardous , the magic of your smirk
and the spell that i have fell in makes me kind of a jerk and
i'd hit a felony to see that smile , and if you laugh
i'll kick the neighbors leaves right out of their piles
the fences that you make me jump , the hikes you make me hitch
and the bikes you make me ride so you can skitch
i'm like , it makes me itch to disobey , you say " don't be a little bitch "
which i shouldn't be okay with but we're dingin - dongin - ditchin
and i was gonna snitch until you turned on your charm
and it's the bully sort i'd pull like forty fire alarms for
you know i'm wooly soft , i'm not very hard
so you pull me when we're runnin from security guards , their stares
level me , the devil made me do it
when really i've been craving for days to misbehave with you
and i know if we're caught you're not the type to save me
but i'll be brave , and take the blame if we can misbehave
their stares level me , the devil made me do it
when really i've been craving for days to misbehave with you
and i know if we're caught you're not the type to save me
but i'll be brave , and take the blame if we can misbehave
their stares level me , the devil made me do it
expel me or sue , i'll never tell em it was you
