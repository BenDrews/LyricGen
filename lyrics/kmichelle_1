he got older but never grew
for his life he can't tell the truth
how to love he ain't got a clue
playing games like he'll never lose you
try to talk to him can't get through
every day he's a different dude
these are the signs of a grown ass boy
better run for the hills i'm just trying to keep it real
you can't raise a man
he's already grown what you gonna do , you wonder why he
acts like a boy
it's cause he wasn't raised right before you
girl , you ain't never gonna change nobody
if he don't wanna , you can't make nobody
cause you can't raise a man
coming home any time at night
expecting you to let it ride
how many tears are you gonna cry ?
playing games like he'll never lose you
you know that the love is changed
how many times he called you out your name ?
these are the signs of a grown ass boy
better run for the hills i'm just keeping it real
gonna take more than a miracle
to change him just let him go
tell me when will you decide
to do better with your life ?
if his momma couldn't do it , what makes you think
you can train a boy to be a man ? it's too late
better off letting him go
no matter how hard you try , you can't raise
