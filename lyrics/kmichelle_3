heart beats , but i don't feel
i touch , but it ain't real
they say i move too fast
going man to man
always holding a new hand
why can't they understand
sex is irrelevant
just a game in my head , i'm playing and i'm winning
( oh ) i broke another heart today
( oh ) and i didn't care until i walked away
cause they think i love 'em
but i love 'em all , love 'em all ye - yeah
i need another one to get over the other one
another one , ye - yeah
cause they think i love 'em
but i love 'em all , love 'em all ye - yeah
i need another one to get over the other one
another one , ye - yeah
they all wait for my call
they all want me to fall
all these men , they're a mess
want me like the rest
i'm continuing not giving my best
why can't they understand
sex is irrelevant
just a game in my head , i'm playing and i'm winning
( oh ) i broke another heart today
( oh ) and i didn't care until i walked away
cause they think i love 'em
but i love 'em all , love 'em all ye - yeah
i need another one to get over the other one
another one , ye - yeah
cause they think i love 'em
but i love 'em all , love 'em all ye - yeah
i need another one to get over the other one
another one , ye - yeah
maybe one day i’ll settle down
but for now
i’ll just play around
and i’ll make em all feel good
that’s how i get ‘em
making all feel special
then i forget them
so i won’t hurt
i keep a lot of them
and i love 'em all
cause they think i love 'em
but i love 'em all , love 'em all ye - yeah
i need another one to get over the other one
another one , ye - yeah
cause they think i love 'em
but i love 'em all , love 'em all ye - yeah
i need another one to get over the other one
another one , ye - yeah
