long distance in the way of what could be
even when you're here , you're not with me
she's having the child i should've carried
i'll be damned if yall get married
how's the baby , how you adjusting ?
ain't gon work , you got problems trusting
let me stop , i'm supposed to be focused
but these nights are the coldest
will you ever let her go ? i don't know
will i ever be first ? i hope
but i ain't just sitting around , can't wait for someone to see my worth
damn i can't compete with a baby
is there any room left in your heart for me
i love him , i love him , i love him , i love him , i love him
maybe i should call , maybe i should call
i love him , i love him , i love him , i love him , i love him
but i never call
maybe that's my flaw
maybe that's why i ain't got a man
cause i be doing too much thinking
tryna compensate for your absence
but no drug can take me where you can
no i just want you where i am
1 , 000 of them , just want one him
drowning in all of my excuses
heart is feeling useless
probably should've used it less
will you ever let her go ? i don't know
will i ever be first ? i hope
but i ain't just sitting around , can't wait for someone to see my worth
damn i can't compete with a baby
is there any room left in your heart for me
i love him , i love him , i love him , i love him , i love him
maybe i should call , maybe i should call
i love him , i love him , i love him , i love him , i love him
but i never call
maybe that's my flaw
after the last time we talked
oh , i was a mess
you had me stressed
oh no no no no no
i wrote the text , i didn't send it
dialed your number , but said forget it
oh , what would it change
she's still in the way
but i
i love him , i love him , i love him , i love him , i love him
maybe i should call , maybe i should call
i love him , i love him , i love him , i love him , i love him
but i never call
maybe that's my flaw
