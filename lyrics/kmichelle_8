and every city i be in , you know she fly with us
it's like hov got bey , it's like bey got jigga
really though let me take y'all back
'09 , double r drop top with the top down
pulled up , double parked , hopped out , tried to spit my game

but i can tell by the bag , by the wrist , by the ring on that
somebody had it on lockdown
the moral of the story not to speak on that

and we don't ever ever ever make love
and we don't ever ever ever say " love "
unless i'm all up in it , she tellin' me she love that d on that , say yeah

mama said don't need no nigga
daddy said don't trust these niggas
so i started to stack them figures
and then my ass got bigger
and that's when shit got realer
and then shit got worse
so many wounds , still ain't heal
but the shit don't hurt

when shit wasn't all good
but i'm tryna change everything
still misunderstood
anybody , anybody , yeah
