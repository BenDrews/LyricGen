mary - beth is living in a world of her own
sitting in the schoolhouse she sews all day with twine
making up a picture , making up a song
some people say she's unusual in the mind
they say that she's unusual in the mind
my name's abe , i run the general store
mary - beth's a strange one , pretty in her way
sitting in the classroom , a - rocking and a - swaying
a - sewing and a - knitting to the rhythms of the rain
stuff from what she's seen mixed with stuff from in her brain
and some say that you'll see america in there
folks say you'll see america there
one day i had a strange dream and mary beth was in it
i dreamed i plucked a bunch of flowers and went to make a visit
i marched up to the schoolhouse and bent down on one knee
asked mary - beth respectfully if she would marry me
asked mary - beth if she would marry me
i said 'my name's abe , i run the general store'
mary - beth gazed down from the chair where she was sitting
said 'abraham i thank you , and i will , on one condition
change the name of the store you keep , call it us knitting
and move it stone by stone to the top of sugar mountain
move that building up to the top of sugar mountain
we will rebuild the general store
'there we'll sell my samplers , make paintings and sing songs
wait for the lion of judah who is rising like the sun
our pets will be the eagles , our crest a rampant bear
and we will see the whole of america from there
some of it is pretty , and some is pretty queer
but we'll see the whole of america there'
mary - beth's proviso didn't seem so strange
i told her 'that scenario is easily arranged
we'll live on sugar mountain , i'll bring my general store
we'll call it us knitting and sell samplers by the door
our pets will be the eagles , and our crest a rampant bear
and when the lion of judah roars a mighty roar
we'll see the whole of america there'
