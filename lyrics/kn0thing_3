i'm going to knit myself a sweater
a sweater that will keep me warm at night
just how many days here must i weather ?
just biding my time...
'cause when i call you on the phone
i'm still lost , i'm still alone
who's going to make it right ? ( oooh wah ooh )
who's going to make it right ? ( oooh wah ooh )
i'm going to write myself a letter
a letter that will make me feel alright
i'll read it to myself five times or seven
but i can't deny
i'm going to need a little more than just some thought that i adore to keep me warm at night. ( oooh wah ooh )
to keep me warm at night. ( oooh wah ooh )
nine days don't amount to much when you cross them off a wall
and i thought i was out of luck 'til you came along and made me fall
now there's nothing more to say , since you left and gone away
and i just don't think i'll get through the night
because i need a little more than just some thought
that i adore to keep me warm at night. ( oooh wah ooh )
oh keep me warm at night. ( oooh wah ooh )
because i need a little more than just some thought that i adore to keep me warm at night. ( oooh wah ooh )
oh keep me warm at night. ( oooh wah ooh )
