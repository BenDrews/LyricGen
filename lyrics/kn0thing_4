i'm knitting myself a hat
and i'm sewing up a head to wear it on
and i'll never be this lonely again
i'm making myself some mittens
and i'm stitching my fingers together to keep them warm inside
and i'll never think about it
and i'll never touch myself again
i'm knitting myself a sweater
to cover the body i'm wearing
and the sweater will hang to my knees
and my hair will grow to the floor
and i'll never go outside again
