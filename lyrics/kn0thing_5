eleanor they stole you now you're sold for parts
they said all the right stuff
they did everything they could just to get you
and now you're mad
you didn't notice when they said
if you miss the last bus
don't be scared 'cause one day soon you'll be like us
eleanor , your life's a song without the hooks
and behind these grey walls
time's not your friend 'cause friends would stay put
and eleanor you're way behind and now you know
will you stay as the bus goes just to get paid ?
