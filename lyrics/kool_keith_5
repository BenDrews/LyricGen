yeah
every morning i wake up , lookin in the mirror
i am , the original black elvis
that's right when you see me , with my wig to the side
wearin my short leather jacket
marilyn monroe on my back
i'm livin that life
i'm for real with this
that's what i think about
i like to tell my fans
i got my shades on , big rock star compared to elvis
signin autographs for rappers , while girls move they pelvis
write songs strictly , for elton john or lionel richie
call up my butler , get clothes washed by the maid
ivory soap , dishes clean , feel like cascade
i count the bills , roll through detroit in sedan deville's
i throw my skully on , big robe like marvin gaye
step in the front row , primetime i move your way
budweiser fest soundcheck , demanding more respect
i come correct through the metro , and turn y'all petrol
i'm up here early bitin donuts sippin on espresso
while you sleep , i creep , gainin ground by the week
ampex reels , makin phone calls , i'm closin deals
i move with skill , ride through philly streets and cherry hill
i'm doin it well , i'm doin it swell
yeah
flying saucers , spaceships move at warp speed
mtv level three when i fly on bet
livin' astro , tell me how you feel
one two , one two
movin roughly , straight to the desert , san antonio
i talk swift the rock king black romeo
i pack clubs , promoters put me out in tokyo
damage your area , i'mma launch a fierce missile
i roast fools , movin butt like i'm toilet tissue
what is your issue ? you over man , i don't miss you
scottie soft , you play like jan van breda kolff
new jersey nets real man , you ain't no darnell hillman
bald head like slick watts , i run rap like mayor koch
forward your info , while tony liu , crank the benzo
move out your driveway , while girls look , turn they eyeway
jealous in fact , tryin to rip the capes off my back
i move with timing , potential , through instrumentals
y'all front on bet with slum gold , drivin rentals
i get real dino , runnin groups like a rhino
endin careers , that's my job , yo your rap is final
cancel your in - stores , your new job is moppin floors
fixin tiles , stoppin potholes up on the roof
you work for service no tips man i speak the truth
flying saucers , spaceships move at warp speed
mtv level three when i fly on bet
livin' astro , tell me how you feel
one two , one two
flying saucers , spaceships move at warp speed
mtv level three when i fly on bet
livin' astro , tell me how you feel
one two , one two , one two
pull your hoods down , i bumrush your afterparty
have your manager scared , the radio station saying sorry
pack your bags , i move my luggage to the coliseum
infinite prime piece with statues in the rock museum
changin my zones , drinkin cocktails on cellular phones
i tour with anthrax , through texas with the rolling stones
booked by the agency , famous artists payin me
hotels with fly room , with sneakers starin at the moon
mad atmosphere , ridin first class on british air
lobster and steak , while y'all back in time , doin remakes
i'm futuristic , nine - nine , to the year 4000
i make announcements , drop skills , then i bounce with
fly young ladies , amg kicks , two thousand mercedes
brand new models , only seen one , in colorado
light green metallic in the shark bar , eatin salad
lorenzo wheels , valet park , shoppin in beverly hills
step up your wildest spaceship kid , in the plymouth prowler
comin down
flying saucers , spaceships move at warp speed
mtv level three when i fly on bet
livin' astro , tell me how you feel
one two , one two
flying saucers , spaceships move at warp speed
mtv level three when i fly on bet
livin' astro , tell me how you feel

flying saucers , spaceships move at warp speed
mtv level three when i fly on bet
