like a soft blue glow on the radio dial
a song comes on and catches your monroe smile
you light me up
like a spark wheel spinning on a silver lighter
the kick of your heartbeat couldn’t be brighter girl
‘cause you light me up
like fireworks
gasoline on bonfires
the flash before a gun fires
no matter what you do yeah
baby you light me up
like an old hollywood spotlight
or a sunset painted just right
with everything you do yeah
baby you light me up
baby you light me up
like a lighthouse shining out to the sea
there’s no way you won’t get to me
‘cause you light me up
like a lit fuse burning up a bottle rocket
whatever you're doing girl don't stop it
‘cause you light me up
like fireworks
gasoline on bonfires
the flash before a gun fires
no matter what you do yeah
baby you light me up
like an old hollywood spotlight
or a sunset painted just right
with everything you do yeah
baby you light me up
baby you light me up
with everything you do yeah
like a blinding flash of a lightning strike
i see you cutting into the night to light
to light me up
like fireworks
or gasoline on bonfires
the flash before a gun fires
no matter what you do yeah
baby you light me up
like an old hollywood spotlight
or a sunset painted just right
with everything you do yeah
baby you light me up
