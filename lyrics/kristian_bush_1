credit card on the counter room 213
started popping bottle tops on the balcony
listening to the waves whispering to me
welcome back down
down
thank god i'm down
denim blue eyes the pride of some small town
dirty blonde hair like honey dripping down
the georgia in her voice is such a sweet sweet sound
calling me
me
and it's calling me
like southern gravity
getting lost in the moss and the shade of an old oak tree
nothing takes the troubles of this world from me
like the pull of southern gravity
you shower off the sun and run into the night
bare feet on the boulevard ready to take flight
every neon’s buzzing but the house band ain't tight
still it feels so right
right
not a cloud in sight
don’t you know rivers run this way for a reason
‘cause its all downhill once you catch that feeling
of southern gravity
getting lost in the moss and the shade of an old oak tree
nothing takes the troubles of this world from me
like the pull of southern gravity
tomorrow we’ll wake up with a memory
so i don't dare move with her lying next to me
‘cause she's my southern gravity
and i’m lost in the moss and the shade of an old oak tree
nothing takes the troubles of this world from me
like the pull of southern gravity
southern gravity
getting lost in the moss and the shade of an old oak tree
nothing takes the weight of the world off of me
like the pull of southern gravity
