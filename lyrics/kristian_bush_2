i wanna buy you a drink , maybe one for this whole town
i may not have that much , but i don’t mind spreading it around
everybody chasing something , i don’t know why they’re running
i take my time to the finish line , cause we all end up with nothing
i don’t know why , know why
everybody wanna die rich
diamonds , champagne
work your way down that list
we try , everybody tries
tries to fit into that ditch
you can’t take it with you when you go
never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch
never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch
started my day , giving away
all of my baseball cards
it felt so good by the afternoon , i gave some guy my car
it ain’t about what you’re driving
or about the gold you’re piling
the less i have to worry about
the more time i got for smiling
don’t know why , know why
everybody wanna die rich
champagne , new plane , work your way down that list
we try , everybody tries
tries to fit it into that ditch
can't take it with you when you go
never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch
never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch
you can stack it up , pack it up
tie it with a red bow
get a great big truck
back it all up , but you can’t take it with you when you go
can't take it when you go
i don’t know why , know why
everybody wanna die rich
diamonds , champagne , newest of the new planes , work your way down that list and
we try , everybody tries
tries to fit it into that ditch
can't take it with you when you go
never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch
never seen a hearse with a trailer hitch
