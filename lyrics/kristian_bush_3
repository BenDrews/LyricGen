if you lean in i'll lean back
don’t be scared of love going this fast
cause every day with you's a dream
and i always remember the whole damn thing
hey baby let the world go round
you can spin it on your finger i'll slow it down
count the stars above till we fall asleep
then wake up and make another memory
hey baby
well you laugh and i smile
and time stands still for a just little while
and in the moments in between
i fall into you and you fall onto me
hey baby let the world go round
you can spin it on your finger i'll slow it down
count the stars above till we fall asleep
then wake up and make another memory
hey baby
well you throw a spark i'll blow on the flame
if you , you need a storm i’ll bring on the rain
we’re like two hearts on a runway running
with our arms out to the wind
yeah , yeah , yeaaah
hey baby let the world go round
you can spin it on your finger i'll slow it down
count the stars above till we fall asleep
then wake up and make another memory
hey baby let the world go round
you can spin it on your finger i'll slow it down
count the stars above till we fall asleep
then wake up and make another memory
hey baby , hey baby , hey baby
