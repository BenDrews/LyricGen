i’m giving up the ghost of old lovers that rattle round my brain
giving up those black crows sitting on my weathervane
giving up my addictions , i won’t hide behind that mask
and when we fall let’s fall together , girl that’s all i ask
giving it up , whoa oh
giving it up , for love
giving it up , yeah yeah
giving it up , for love
i’m giving up the dark blue places that are never gonna heal
i’m folding up my cape , i am no man of steel
i’m giving up the grapes of wrath and all these dust bowl fields
i prayed for rain and now i know just how good it feels
giving it up , whoa oh
giving it up , for love
giving it up , yeah yeah
giving it up , for love
red letter words say two are better than one
lost like the moonlight in your hair waiting on the sun
tomorrow’s horizon where the road will lead
and yesterday’s so bitter
but tonight your kisses taste so sweet
neon sunsets that shine so cold
a house of cards that always seems to fold
all the lies i’ve bought and i have sold
yeah yeah yeah , yeah yeah
fear of flying , fear of dying , growing old
of never finding another hand to hold
i rest my weary soul , i lay this burden down
finally surrender and wrap your arms around me
giving it up
take it cause i’m giving it up
giving it up for love
