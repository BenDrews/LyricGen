if you were here right now
you’d be wrapped around
my waist with your hands
you'd have that grin
ten kisses in
and twenty toes in the sand
you'd push my hat back , and you’d pull me in
i love this picture , so i'm hitting send
i'm sending you a sunset
i’m thinking of you
this big old sky full of purples and reds is making me blue
i’m sending you a sunset
wishing you were here with me
when i close my eyes i can almost see your silhouette
i want your heart to know that my heart will never forget
so i’m sending you a sunset
if you were here right now
your hair falling down
to the sound of the busy streets
it’s just a matter of time
until the city shines
and you're tangled up in the sheets
yeah you'd move closer and i'd be through
i love this picture , i just sent to you
i'm sending you a sunset
yeah i’m thinking of you
this big old sky full of purples and reds is making me blue
i’m sending you a sunset
wishing you were here with me
when i close my eyes i can almost see your silhouette
i want your heart to know that my heart will never forget
so i’m sending you a sunset
everytime i take a picture of the sun when its going down
i just gotta send it to you
so you'll know what i've found
so you'll know what i've found
if you were here right now
you’d be wrapped around
my waist with your hands
