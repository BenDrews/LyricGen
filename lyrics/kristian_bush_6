they say the measure of a man
is what he does when he’s in trouble
when you face the fires of hell
will you stand or will you stumble
it ain’t the easiest way of life
to push a demon in the night
can’t be scared to pick a fight
you gotta do right
yeah we all walk tall in the daylight
yeah we all walk tall when it feels right
if ever wanna be a man
if you ever wanna be a rebel
you gotta walk tall in the moonlight
there'll be days when you’re alone
there'll be days you wanna crumble
it'll bring you to your knees
you can rise out of the rubble
put it all on the line to lose
yeah you bet it all on the truth
it doesn't matter what you say
it only matters what you do
yeah we all walk tall in the daylight
yeah we all walk tall when it feels right
if ever wanna be a man
if you ever wanna be a rebel
you gotta walk tall in the moonlight
