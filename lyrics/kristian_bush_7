i ran into a wall of liquor tonight
i really need a cab and there ain’t one in sight
i’m wandering and stumbling and falling all over myself
i wish this old sidewalk would just stand still
long enough to get me back to my hotel
i’m starting to think that maybe i could use some help
just trying to stay on top of my flip flops
at least until this old world stops spinning , spinning
people in the bars all laugh when i pass
they’re laying down bets that i’ll bust my ass
it looks like a mile but i only gotta make it one more block
just trying to stay on top of my flip flops
just did a little fred astaire around the last street sign
i think i might have kissed a palm tree and asked it to be mine
here i come ready or not
even jagger wishes he had the moves that i got
once i get going yeah it feels like i just can’t stop
just trying to stay on top of my flip flops
at least until this old world stops spinning , spinning
people in the bars all laugh when i pass
they’re laying down bets that i’ll bust my ass
it looks like a mile but i only gotta make it one more block
just trying to stay on top of my flip flops
spinning , spinning
people in the bars all laugh when i pass
they’re laying down bets that i’ll bust my ass
it looks like a mile but i only gotta make it one more block
it’s a balancing act
just trying to stay on top of my flip flops
