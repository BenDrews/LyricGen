empty glass summer hot
not a single drop
waiting on an angel that never comes
taking bets that i can beat
this losing streak
waiting on an angel that never comes
a dreamer’s dream is never done
hey girl where you been
can’t you see the shape i’m in
i’m waiting on an angel
you sure take your pretty little time
wish you'd put your lips on mine
waiting on an angel
that never comes
another day up all night
i can't shut my eyes
waiting on an angel that never comes
bare feet in her jeans
letting down her wings
waiting on an angel that never comes
a dreamer’s dream is never done
hey girl where you been
can’t you see the shape i’m in
i’m waiting on an angel
you sure take your pretty little time
wish you'd put your lips on mine
waiting on an angel
been keeping my place in line
waiting on the devil to apologize
yeah you know i love a good surprise
i said hey girl where you been
its about time that you walked in
i was down to the bottom of the barrel of luck
i was just about to give up
and she said " hey boy where you been
i can tell from the shape you're in
you've been waiting on an angel”
you sure took your pretty little time
come on come on put your lips on mine
waiting on an angel
i’ve been waiting on an angel
i’m waiting on an angel
there she comes
