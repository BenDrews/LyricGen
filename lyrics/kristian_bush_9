i’m feeling fine in california
i’m doing fine right here in l.a
i love the sunshine and the way it warms ya
people treat me so good here
treat me so good here that i just might stay
there’s a sinister side to this civilized town
there’s a lot going on when the sun goes down
all the hippies and the freaks sitting out on venice beach
they all got a game going
they come at you from every angle
and somehow you always know they’re gonna win
i’m doing fine in california
i’m feeling fine right here in l.a
i love the sunshine and the way it warms ya
people treat me so good here
treat me so good here that i just might stay
people stuck in traffic on saturday afternoon
like park benches on the 405
the other suckers on the 101 they got to keep on moving to survive
concrete on the backbeat drop down the groove on the interstate
well i’m here in this bar with this cute little waitress
who keeps on bringing cold beers my way
i’m doing fine in california
i’m feeling fine right here in l.a
i love the sunshine and the way it warms ya
people treat me so good here
treat me so good here that i just might stay
well i miss your smile back there in tennessee
miss the love and the kisses you used to give to me
and when it all started coming apart it tore my heart in two
when i go outside and i look around
i think about the palm trees in this town
i see the red in the pacific coast sunset and i don’t feel so blue
i’m doing fine in california
i’m feeling fine right here in l.a
i love the sunshine and the way it warms ya
people treat me so good here
they treat me so good here that i just might stay
i’m feeling fine
i just might stay
