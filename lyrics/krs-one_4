if you don't like what you singing , you sing a different hook
if you don't like what you cooking , you get a different cook
if you don't like what you wearing , you get a different look
you wanna escape armageddon , read a different book
when knowledge is right there , we don't even look
december 2012 got this whole world shook
but look , the last days for others are the first days for us
the question to ask is who can you trust
respect to all that 2012 stuff
but when you really study it it's fear , it don't apply to us
yo , hollywood lies to us , all day
the question is what does your culture say
where's your culture at ? who's your prophet ?
what history guides your spiritual logic ?
it starts with a story , then it's hypnotic
then any myth that comes along , you just adopted it
why ? because your culture , you forgot it
december 2012 , let's continue this topic
turn the page , the present world age
began 3114 bc
according to the mayan calendar , this age concludes december 21st 2012 ad
this 5125 years cycle of calm is one world age
nothing changes overnight , it's all a process
a transition , it happens over many days
in the mayan calculation a k'in , is one day
the mayan winal , that's 20 days
the tun is 360 days
a k'atun is 7200 days
the b'ak'tun is 144 , 000 days
and they applied that to the milky way
in the cycles they saw the sun
moving across the milky way's equator
lining up with other galactic neighbors
we've been shifting for 30 years it seems
from 1980 to about 2016
the shift is now , it's occurring now
but if you're learning from the movies you won't know how to survive
or stay alive after the storm
cause after that a new world order is born
oh , you don't know , man ? about they programs ?
you still watching lindsay , you don't see that low hand ?
let go , man , the flood is coming
don't be scared , get prepared , keep your motor running
rock with me
higher level
yep , it's all mass control , here's the philosophy
cortés knew about the aztec prophecy
before he invaded their society
he studied their cultural psychology
he knew they had armor , guns , and steeds
so he arrived in the aztec year 1 - reed
that's the year quetzalcoatl
was prophecized to return from exile in fact
cortés played out the aztec myth
and took away those people's will to resist
cortés played on religious beliefs
and blinded the aztecs , cause he was a thief
look , the yucatan , that's a mayan book of cycles
it lets the mayans know when the gods are gonna strike you
in fact , every 13 k'atuns you see
the mayans were visited with a catastrophe
so every 200 and 56 or 7 years
the mayan people lived with this fear
so on the island of tayasal now flores
the spanish came armed with this knowledge
they knew according to the mayan heavens
that the next cycle was 1697
so as the mayans stood there fixed on the heavens
the spanish showed up with all of their weapons
march 13th , 1697
the mayan people learned a terrible lesson
your fears and tears are used against you
cause 80% of world control is mental
but back to the mayans , they getting some more
257 years after tayasal
a us - backed coup overthrows their democracy in 1954
that's exactly 257 years from when the spaniards arrived at their shores
i'm getting to the core of the lesson
lets see what happens in 2211
that's the next cycle , that people remember
like 2012 , the 21st of december
the consciousness may shift , you may turn the light
but you are the universe , you're gonna be alright
the pole may shift , your soul may lift
to higher consciousness but you know all this
the edutainment style will persist
forget the fear , it's knowledge that runs all this
