ah yeah , that's whatcha say when you see a devil down
ah yeah , that's whatcha say when you take the devil's crown
ah yeah , stay alive all things will change around
ah yeah , what , ah yeah
so here i go kickin' science in ninety - five
i be illin , parental discretion is advised still
don't call me nigga , this mc goes for his
call me god , cause that's what the black man is
roamin' through the forest as the hardest lyrical artist
black women you are not a bitch you're a goddess
let it be known , you can lean on krs - one
like a wall cause i'm hard , i represent god
wack mc's have one style : gun buck
but when you say , " let's buck for revolution "
they shut the fuck up , can't get with it
down to start a riot in a minute
you'll hear so many bowe - bowe - bowe , you think i'm riddick
while other mc's are talkin' bout up with hope down with dope
i'll have a devil in my infrared scope , woy
that's for calling my father a boy and , klak klak klak
that's for putting scars on my mother's back , bo
that's for calling my sister a ho , and for you
buck buck buck , cause i don't give a motherfuck
remember the whip , remember the chant
remember the rope and
you black people still thinkin' about vot - ing
every president we ever had lied
you know i'm kinda glad nixon died
this is not the first time i came to the planet
but everytime i come , only a few could understand it
i came as isis , my words they tried to ban it
i came as moses , they couldn't follow my commandments
i came as solomon , to a people that was lost
i came as jesus , but they nailed me to a cross
i came as harriet tubman , i put the truth to sojourner
other times , i had to come as nat turner
they tried to burn me , lynch me and starve me
so i had to come back as marcus garvey , bob marley
they tried to harm me , i used to be malcolm x
now i'm on the planet as the one called krs
kickin' the metaphysical , spiritual , tryin' to like
get with you , showin' you , you are invincible
the black panther is the black answer for real
in my spiritual form , i turn into bobby seale
on the wheels of steel , my spirit flies away
and enters into kwame ture
in the streets there is no eq , no di - do - di - do - di - do
so i grab the air and speak through the code
the devil cannot see through as i unload
into another cerebellum
then i can tell em , because my vibes go through denim
and leather whatever , however , i'm still rockin'
we used to pick cotton , now we pick up cotton when we shoppin'
have you forgotten why we buildin in a cypher
yo hear me kid , government is building in a pyramid
the son of god is brighter than the son of man
the spirit is , check your dollar bill g , here it is
we got no time for fancy mathematics
your mental frequency frequently pickin up static
makin you a naked body , addict and it's democratic
they press auto , and you kill it with an automatic
