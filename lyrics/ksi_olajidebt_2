way too young for the ring ting
now you wanna dance on a king ping
sixty - eight plus one , that's a win - win
time to slide in like a penguin
you don't need ice , no bling bling
no hubby , no wife , just a friend ting
live your whole life to the ending
there's no point pretending
let's be friends , with benefits
we can chill , and netflix
no strings , like hendrix
let's pimp , like kendrick
let's go deep into a world , that only we can see
they can't touch us , they can't judge us cuz we're crazy young and free
it's not me troubling you
it's not you troubling me
can i trust you not to love me ?
let's be fwbs
