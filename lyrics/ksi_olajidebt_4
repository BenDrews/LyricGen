done with all the past now i’m all about tomorrow
little did you know , i’m the one they follow , all you other fools are hollow
opposition here like oh no

workflow is beyond no time here to be
take time to respond when you texting me
got no time for your shit
i'm tryna get lit
climbing to the top is why i had to go and split
destined for better
so watch me go get it
trying to stop the man
pfft , pathetic
i see what you’re scheming
but the man is so blessed that he’ll fuck up your demon
