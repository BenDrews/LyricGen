look at myself , i see my face
in blurry visions everyday
smoke 'n' mirrors
blind me from the way
smoke 'n' mirrors
blind me from the way
i see your hidden agenda
had to send me shit , but i'm killing the sender
run it on my shit , then i left it to render
and nigga i'm the shit , came up quick like i'm slender
man , i'm on a high one
counting all my worries ( oh no , i've got none )
counting all my monies ( oh wait , you want some ) suck one
i don't give a shit and i'm not wearing your tees
i've got my old girls down here , chilling on knees
i've got my new girls down here , willing to please
i'm on the next ting , quick thing , wired up , cheque please
still i’m still a young thing , ain't that something ?
living life like i never thought i could
with my team here around and everything is all good
and then i
look at myself , i see my face
in blurry visions everyday
smoke 'n' mirrors
blind me from the way
smoke 'n' mirrors
blind me from the way
i grew up poor , everyday i wore that same dirty yankee cap
low over my eyes , i didn't wanna talk to no - one , i was angry fast
forward to a month ago i was in the new era office
and they let me take what i like imagine that
i guess things do change , couldn't afford family holidays
growing up , but today i've been on two planes
never begged it , why you have to go making a scene
my bars go over heads like michelangelo painting a ceiling
life's like a motion picture , we’re blinded by smoke ‘n’ mirrors
and lies that were told to give a desire to go and buy
all the things we that can't afford , we're convinced that we need
i just want to be happy and not live in the street
they fucking with my chakra , i'm just tryna do me
you idolizing guys that lie and hide behind their jewelry
their heart is empty and their soul is hollow
living like there's no tomorrow , i know every moment's borrowed
like a walls of sorrow
smoke 'n' mirrors
blind me from the way
smoke 'n' mirrors
blind me from the way
i don't wanna get lost on this long road
i've been looking for something hoping it unfolds
but i see a lot of smoke in the air
and i've been looking in the mirror but the reflection is unknown
am i going mad , losing my mind ?
i tell myself i'm doing just fine too many times
but man are dead weight , my boy said , " get your head straight "
i'm like " brothe' , you can say that again "
but i never would've imagined this chain of events
i remember when i just wanted some fame in the ends
trying to do it all the same as my friends
and it's funny how it switched up , maybe sing your next song
why we tryna see clear ? looking through the mist , but
i don't wanna be here , when i get a glimpse up
look at myself i see my face
in blurry visions everyday
smoke 'n' mirrors
blind me from the way
smoke 'n' mirrors
blind me from the way
