fuck the rocks , man upgraded to a hublot
twenty million later , still dismissing like i'm pluto
still i'm going every time they come and see me
still i'm going , wiling in my lamborghini
la - lamborghini , la - lamborghini
bitch , i know you see me in my lamborghini
la - lamborghini , la - lamborghini
ride so quick , you would think i'm houdini
round 2 motherfucker , still i'm riding low
satin black with tron cause you know i got to change the flow
he goes so bitter , like killing the room
think that you're hot like the reapers of doom ?
over nine thousand , i'm feeling a boom
so what are you saying ?
cause i'm on a roll try and catch me , fully stacked
like an apache 17 starting , nuke missiles coming
grab my dick and now i got a list of girls , i'm cumming
change the lyrics , still i'm winning with the remix incoming
course i had to hop up on the remix ( my brother )
swah the super's always been the prefix ( burning rubber )
studio with jj like we got one
then he actually went and got one
then the team said let's release it , let them stream it , let them pree it
i'm going kinda slow for the fellas , levels up and i'm still speeding
my engines warming up the scenic route so you can see it
they see me at a show , they're like " oh lord , i don't believe it "
( super swah ) everybody left in the dust , better rush
when it comes to the flow man are best , think it's us
going like a lamborghini when i'm next to the bus
and a cosign , anybody next to the boss
tell 'em don't second guess that the next thing is us
so we chilling in the flat just collecting the bucks
no officer
i ain't try'na get arrested in cuffs ( no way )
if you wanna give me points
you better put out the req with the stuff
i ain't gonna stop unless it's petrol or stuff
i was built for the speed , gotta rep for the stuff
gotta rep for the team and the direction is up
everybody meet my brother tef , give it up
you take it to the streets , why they take it to the tweets ?
i'm a good fella , sleek with manners and dressed neat
after the king speak , they blasting the repeat
it's a game but we play for keeps , don't sleep
i wish i had a genie , i would probably have a 'ghini
i ain't got neither , but i promise you gon' see me
little nigga greedy cause i never had a freebie
then i fell in love with the white girl before yeezy
i'm a menace , you're a medi , what's a judas to a jedi ?
gots to get my own cause mummy told me never redeye
i'm eating but i'm try'na grab myself a mil
and i ain't even eden , i'm a hazard on the field
them man ain't scoring points , they switched sides like falcao
i been running them miles though , trill nigga till the outro
them man flow ups up , my style more south pole
my style more south pole , you was indoors , i'm an outlaw
man better know their place on a beat
man better know their place on a song
can't clash me , that's long
i'll lyrically spin a brudda all day long
ain't gonna gas , ain't gonna lie
whenever i'm on a riddim , i'm bringing that vibe
if you don't know , better get locked on
i don't think them man are ready for the don
i can't lie brudda , i ain't got a lambo
but i was on that backroad , riding with that rambo
badboy , rudeboy , show me , what's your angle ?
'nough of them are talking the talk , but they can't even handle
but back to the subject , let me get real up
see man driving a german beemer
shout out ksi for the feature
let me do it , they're beginning , really can't see us
let me get deeper
i don't wanna say too much
but i'm flowing like i'm wiling in a lamborghini
la - lamborghini , la - lamborghini
bitch , i know you see me in my lamborghini
la - lamborghini , la - lamborghini
ride so quick , you would think i'm houdini
