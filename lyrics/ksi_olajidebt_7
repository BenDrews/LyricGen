they see us now we're on the internet
we don't care bout what they say or what they said
let them know that this is my house
we're blacking out like somebody just turned the lights out
it goes off like
we know that it ( goes off ! )
she knows that it ( goes off ! )
we know that it ( goes off ! )
every time we roll up say
we know that it ( goes off ! )
she knows that it ( goes off ! )
we know that it ( goes off ! )
