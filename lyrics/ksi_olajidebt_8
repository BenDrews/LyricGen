saving moments in the pictures on my phone
and i know i never wanna live it on my own
i don't want to care about the problems in my zone
so i feel no pain when you throw your sticks and stones
so i'm saving moments in the pictures on my phone
and i know i never wanna live it on my own
i don't want to care about the problems in my zone
so i feel no pain when you throw your sticks and stones
i remember the days when you laughed at division
telling me to stay in the lane with the peak of my life is the whip for permission
nah impossible mission imma do it
and no riding the wave and not lose it
didn't come here for life to live but live the life
i don't care if you're a cynic
just like the rock in '01 imma bring it
bring a new vibe in the taste for the better
i don't care for the weather
bring the whole team and they'll win it all together
yea yea
ain't laughing now
getting on the flashbacks and the throwbacks look at all these pics
moments that i live for
standing on the cliff for
where you always find me
saving moments in the pictures on my phone
and i know i never wanna live it on my own
i don't want to care about the problems in my zone
so i feel no pain when you throw your sticks and stones
so i'm saving moments in the pictures on my phone
and i know i never wanna live it on my own
i don't want to care about the problems in my zone
so i feel no pain when you throw your sticks and stones
this my life i'm gonna live it
didn't come here to stop and just quit it
didn't come here to flop and just bin it
didn't come here to listen to
all the people who hate the fact that i did it
thinking never slave for the come up
and rather team risk wanna prismata
took it on the chin and then kill with a celeb
i came , i saw , and i conquered
how did i give up the reigns and i plondered
just gotta do it again
and kill it again , and do it again
and kill it again , and do it again
everything i do , no i do it all for you
so savour the moment
these are all the moments that i live for
standing on a cliff for where you're gonna find me
saving moments in the pictures on my phone
and i know i never wanna live it on my own
i don't want to care about the problems in my zone
so i feel no pain when you throw your sticks and stones
so i'm saving moments in the pictures on my phone
and i know i never wanna live it on my own
i don't want to care about the problems in my zone
so i feel no pain when you throw your sticks and stones
mmm mmm mmm mmm
