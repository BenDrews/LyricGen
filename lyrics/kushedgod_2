money talks , so shut the fuck up and listen
you fuckin' kids in intermission , i'm in pole position
and you're in no position , i'm itchin' to close - in in it
zone and kill it , close , conceal it , leave that bitch with no forensics
bitch , it's not a stain on me little homie
you don't know me , better know your role jebroney , little phony
tryin' to clone me , i'm my only
like i'm kobe in the post , you can't control me
spittin' scriptures , niggas feel like i'm holy
niggas know he bound to be a problem in this rap shit
i snap bitch , my stats went from average to classic
went h.a.m. and did damage , y'all mans will get sandwiched
my plan is the planet where the middle of my hand is
alpha male , you niggas do what you manage
i'm shootin' for the stars , really feelin' like i can't miss
my flow is australian money , bruh , you can't rip
keep it live , smokin' , gettin' high until i'm dead , bitch
right , kushedgod in this mu' fucka
right , i smoked the whole jar like oh lord , au revoir
girl scout cookie and not them little hoes , y'all
talkin' that west coast , i got it from my home boy
i hate green weed like guru fans hate solar
got no respect for it like a grown man with a mohawk
or a big mouth with no heart or a black bitch with a nose job
just some shit i don't go for
i don't really give a fuck 'bout offendin' , just my opinion
ill nigga , full off philepe chow an i'm ventin'
tryin' to gas this asian broad for a bj and a happy endin'
still pitchin' like i'm in the ninth innin'
i'm a closer , i'm mariano with the flow , bruh
see me suited , five panels with the bears on 'em
every bar they ric flairin' for 'em , dza
okay , i got a little somethin' somethin'
we gon' crush it down , roll 'em up , and offer it to her
and see how she act about it , right ?
