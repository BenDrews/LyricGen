183rd shit

cooking up a batch
ladies show they titties
real niggas tip they caps , real trappers
for my hustler niggas with no choice
posting up , slanging that oh boy
stay on your grind , only way to turn a 300 to a rolls royce
life is good , nah , life is great , now i'm 'bout to get my niggas straight
god bless a nigga with some legal ones so i can stay off the interstate
not everybody getting money , not everybody selling out shows
not everybody toured the world like four times , three albums in stores
from australia up to montauk , i kill 'em with the don talk
and when it comes to this indie bread , i'm the hip - hop thom yorke
i'm too real for the radio heads , i'm an underground king
but these bitches can't stop my show and that's word to the pimp
low eating lobster and shrimp , all the bad bitches want to link
i'm like , fuck with a real nigga and stop feeling bad for that simp
that's the other species , come sip some of this pj
and smoke some of this sweet tree and everything will be geetchi
dza
i told your bitch like alex rawls
mister jones , full riding laws
pop my calls in a ride with paws
got a lot of nines , got a lot of fours
i'm a lane ward man , got a lot of goals
know how to get the kitchen like a lot of o
know when to burn out , before it's time to go
i'm a highlight reel so rewind it , ho
pick them up , out the pound
lighting up every time the saints get a first down
hold the flow so you can show us right now
you can get a purse and some work right now
this mack hand , ho , don't get the backhand
she chase ghosts like ms. pacman
he paid a ho to come back , fam
god damn
they respect the don
eighteen karats with the red rubies and piguets is on
platinum rolex , double - roll bezel , and walk around with alexis on
courtside in my concords
with my niggas wiling out , smoking out tours
life's about choices , got to make yours
the right set of keys open up the right doors
we trying to turn a little something to a lot more
you gotta go a little further than you won't go
it's like a hundred out there , had enough blow
i'm talking enough blow to make it below , zero
i'm the underdog's hero
to that dope boy , praying for a kilo
to the little nigga praying for a way out
keep your head up , shorty , we gonna make it out
made it out now
hella stamps in my passport
overseas airport
coming through the hood up in foreign cars
bitch , letting the weed flow
i'm hood rich , i can't change , ho
meeting , smelling like weed smoke
negotiate my record deal like a dope deal
probably why a nigga take like a ki of dope
nigga , you need a plug
top soft , but i grind hard to afford
to weld them switches to my dashboard
lowriders and all , exotics to nascars
amongst all these stars , seven grams in the raw
that's a grammy award in my granddaddy car
with my granddaddy kangol , higher than a halo
sliced like tomato with precision on them blades , ho
it don't go down until he say so
extra cheese , hold the mayo
got stacks in san diego , now i'm hiding out
large amounts to count , just fill them duffel bags and weigh 'em
spitta slayed 'em , no santa
she's thirsty , get a fanta
bitch passing out , somebody fan her
drive in theatre
