what you skippin' steps for ?
i thought you poppin' collars bout them dollars like you creflo
you can fall off if you step wrong
either move over or get stepped on
shit
catch me at pappadeaux cracking crab and peeling shrimp
nigga , wait your turn , fly a plane or catch a blimp
sideways sitting , bubble eye blade chipping off the corners that i bend
on some 20 - 20 twins , watch your mouth
we don't play with children 'round these parts
even titans kill gods , you ain't eating then you starve
i ain't fucking with no sobs , dem broads and petty frauds
it's hard talking bars , good lord won't get you far
these days and times i raise the ways of rhymes
nigga , fuck that bullshit you could cut cocaine with mine
pyrex flow , my exo - skeleton heaven sent
heavy as cement sediments walked only by elephants
ever since i was 7 pounds it was evident
that a legend i was meant to be and everything else is irrelevant
selfishly , king remember in time i coined that phrase
you could never be the same because you ain't got no change
baby steps , nigga
done dap writer , tight rope walker
big top 10 giant , i hope you all watchin'
i'm awesome , attention undivided
defeat my competition landslide style , fuck an undecided
i got it , i'm on it , you driving , i'm focused
i push on my opponents cause fronting i don't condone it
bitch , you better get a grip , better yet get a gip
life is short , the good die , mostly over bullshit
and that bullshit costs
you working for a worker , walking 'round holling ''boss''
talking 'bout you're blood , but your lights cutting out
ya'll boys got the game lopsided , you don't walk polished
parachuting off your palm pilot
is you seeking or reaching ? either way better stretch for it
upside down , look what i rep ho
o - g
riiiiiight
do anything for breakfast from pan pans
up early thinking about a grand scam
grand scheme , damn fiends
beating down the door , got it jumping like a trampoline
ain't my fault you into mud , kid
pride damage more hearts than love did
gift wrap flows ribbon and bow
they remind me i'm that nigga , but i already know
on deck , man these niggas never saw paper
fam , i'm still spending small faces
gold bracelets , rolex's , no small faces
kushed god bitch
