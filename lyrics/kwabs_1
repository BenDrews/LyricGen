how long can lovers stand
to prove they were right ?
why did i fold my hand ?
why choose another fight ?
how long would we have gone
to know we shouldn't stay ?
i saw you walk the wire
i watched you burn away
and somehow it moved me
your love has powers over me
oh what dream is this ?
somehow it towers over me
send your love to move me
my world has powered over me
in perfect ruins
somehow it towers over me
who said we had it all ?
our hearts no longer lie
who knew the veil would fall ?
whoâ€™d guess that we would cry ?
what more were we to do ?
two souls who had their fill
your love it keeps me here
you keep me wondering still
somehow it moved me
your love has powers over me
oh what dream is this ?
somehow it towers over me
send your love to move me
my world has powered over me
in perfect ruins
somehow it towers over me
in perfect ruins
somehow it towers over me
