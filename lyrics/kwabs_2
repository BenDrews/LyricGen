it’s safe to say we made it
along the path we tread so well
and the shades we use to paint it
can’t start to show our lives parallel
eyes to the ground
we watch our feet
we’re a little bruised and battle - worn
but the walls they built to keep us
cannot shield our storm
we prayed for love
we prayed for love
we prayed for love
someone in the distance
who will listen
listen to our breaking hearts
we prayed for love
someone in the distance
who will listen
listen to our breaking hearts
the endless days of thunder
seemed to leave us here without a chance
feeling like a world around us
is falling down like an avalanche
we look ahead you know our hearts
are gunna lead us through another fight
the negative like string between us
strong in our desire
we prayed for love
we prayed for love
we prayed for love
someone in the distance
who will listen
listen to our breaking hearts
we prayed for love
someone in the distance
who will listen
listen to our breaking hearts
wherever the road takes us
the winds began to break up
just stay by my side
wherever the road takes us
the winds began to break up
just stay by my side
we prayed for love
someone in the distance
who will listen
listen to our breaking hearts
we prayed for love
someone in the distance
who will listen
listen to our breaking hearts
oh we prayed for love
prayed for love
oh we prayed for love
