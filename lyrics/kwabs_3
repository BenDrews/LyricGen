lately i , i've been rolling with the tide
it swept me away , to another place
lord knows , you ain't seen enough of me
why did i fall asleep , on a love so deep ?
i fell apart when i couldn't see
i was cheating on me
broke my own heart , when i couldn't see
i was cheating on me
our love is like a fading melody
a song i should've sung , a note i should've reached
a loneliness , that i find hard to describe
stayed up so many times , i could've been by your side
i fell apart when i couldn't see
i was cheating on me
broke my own heart , when i couldn't see
i was cheating on me
why don't you cry ?
you live this life
you live this life
i fell apart when i couldn't see
i was cheating on me
broke my own heart , when i couldn't see
i was cheating on me
cheating on me
i fell apart when i couldn't see
i was cheating on me
broke my own heart , when i couldn't see
i was cheating on me
