i've never thought it before , now it's all i can see
i don't get no reward , without trading in cruelty
you're asking to suffer , oh , why ?
i'll never put the two things together
might see heaven tonight , might get turned away
there’s only one that you want , but they’re one in the same
people want each other , oh
but i'll never put the two things together
why would you fight for love ?
why would you pay to hurt yourself ?
there's still nothing to hold onto
but your pride
why would you fight for love ?
why can't you fight for something else ?
there's still nothing to hold onto
but your pride , oh
you’re faithful as hell to what you never had
walking the streets , throwing good , often bad
when i could be someone for you
somebody who will hold you together
i give what i can , might be too much
i’ll give what i need , i’ll give you love
and all i'm asking
is for you to put my whole world together
why would you fight for love ?
why would you pay to hurt yourself ?
there's still nothing to hold onto
but your pride
why would you fight for love ?
why can't you fight for something else ?
there's still nothing to hold onto
but your pride , oh
but your pride , yeah
might see heaven
you might get turned away
there's still nothing to hold onto
but why would i , why would i go that way ?
why would i fight for love ?
why would i pay to hurt myself ?
yeah , there's still nothing to hold onto
but your pride , yeah
why would i fight for love ?
why can't i fight for something else ?
there's still nothing to hold onto
but your pride
