gotta slow up , gotta shake this high
kwabs !
gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
zoovier !
'cause if i don't walk , then i get caught out
and i'll be falling all the way down
1738 !
hundred headlights making me blind
all of your pleasures catching my eye
if i jump once , then i never think twice
but your temptations making me stay another night
and my senses only lie to me , lie to me
i don't know how i feel so raw to me , raw to me
i gotta check myself before i get what i want
find out it's not what i thought it was
and you know i
gotta slow up , gotta shake this high
gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
'cause if i don't walk , then i get caught out
and i'll be falling all the way down
turn my head and shut my eyes
doesn't even matter if i'm wrong or right
'cause if i don't walk , i keep messing around
and i'll be falling all the way down
tell myself " leave ! " , while i'm still strong
" don't look back ! " , 'til i'm ten miles gone
and when the road stops , i'm gonna keep on
until i end up in the place that i belong
but the pressure's pushing me back again
telling me not to pretend
there isn't any use even trying to get you out my head
so i lift my feet off the ground
and i'm gonna walk right up
gotta slow up , gotta shake this high
gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
'cause if i don't walk , then i get caught out
and i'll be falling all the way down
turn my head and shut my eyes
doesn't even matter if i'm wrong or right
'cause if i don't walk , i keep messing around
and i'll be falling all the way down
it's time to turn it up
how i live my life , bottles with the lights
they know i'm comin' , i'm right on the way
and i ain't got no type
i know you see me , baby come to my place
my gun be hella bright
won't have to struggle , show you a new surrounding
i'm just living life
girl i'm young , rich and famous
and don't know if i'm livin' it right
all i know is i came from nothing
now everything i want i buy
all i know is i watch everything
and nothin' don't cross my eye
all i know is i love my gang
for zoovier they gon' ride
nit da grit say " i got you "
i've been handlin' for my side
say i'm young , rich and famous
and don't know if i'm livin' it right
all i know is i watch everything
and nothin' don't cross my eye
all i know is i love my gang
for zoovier they gon' ride
gotta slow up , gotta shake this high
gotta take a minute just to ease my mind
'cause if i don't walk , then i get caught out
and i'll be falling all the way down
turn my head and shut my eyes
doesn't even matter if i'm wrong or right
'cause if i don't walk , i keep messing around
and i'll be falling all the way down
