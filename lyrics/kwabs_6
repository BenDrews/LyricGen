war's over but i soldier on
still battling the ghost long gone
still struggling to see the signs
too heavy for a heart like mine
save me , save me
keep my heritage to keep me clean
keep the devil watching over me
save me , save me
last stand before i walk away
spell - bound i stutter , i pray
release me , say you need me
still burning from the heat of your touch
know i shouldn't but it's never enough
i know i don't belong
but i'm scared to leave you
