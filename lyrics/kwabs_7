i know what you done
doesn't matter how you try to hide it , no
and you can run forevermore
but you'll only get trapped inside it , oh no oh
you can try to shut it out in the morning
you can try to erase it in the evening
but you should listen long and hard through the warning
cause soon enough , that stuff is going to get you up
better look over your shoulder and make sure that you're alone
better stay out of the shadows when you wander far from home
better look over your shoulders son cause when you're on your own
it'll creep into your head and it'll never let you go
know where you been , giving in to every temptation , oh
and you can live anywhere you want if you can handle your creation , oh no
you can try to shut it out in the morning
you can try to erase it in the evening
but you should listen long and hard through the warning
cause soon enough , that stuff is going to get you up
better stay out of the shadows when you wonder for the fall
better look over your shoulders because when you're on your own
it'll creep into your head and it'll never let you go
better look over your shoulder and make sure that you're alone
better stay out of the shadows when you wonder for the fall
better look over your shoulders because when you're on your own
it'll creep into your head and it'll never let you go
better stay out of the shadows when you wonder for the fall
better look over your shoulders because when you're on your own
