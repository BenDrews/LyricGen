i hide my tears in the rain
but it doesn't wash off the pain
i find myself at the bridge where we used to kiss
go see a riot tonight
that the fear starts to strike
and never replies
you should be my ritual , gravitational force
but i get so scared to let you know the devil in my thoughts
love and war
can fill your heart 'till it bursts , lift your feet off the earth
love and war
will tear the soul full of hate
save yourself , save yourself while you can
as i breathe back through your door
it's like we never met before
the spinning image of the man you taught to love
i know all your moral shows
i've been in line , i've been in line
i'm terrified
you should be my ritual , my gravitational force
but i get so scared to let you know the devil in my thoughts
love and war
can fill your heart 'till it bursts , lift your feet off the earth
love and war
will tear the soul full of hate
save yourself , save yourself while you can
you should be my ritual , gravitational force
you should be my ritual , gravitational force
love and war
can fill your heart 'till it bursts
lift your feet off the earth
love and war
will tear the soul full of hate
save yourself , save yourself
love and war
can fill your heart 'till it bursts
lift your feet off the earth
love and war
will tear the soul full of hate
save yourself , save yourself while you can
