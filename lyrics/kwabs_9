fall into me , i got you now
i won't give up , never let you down
let's get it straight , it's time to choose
i came to play , don't play to lose
cause it looks to me
like you're needin' a change
i've got the key , let you out the cage
but , i want you all for my own
i don't need no other love
there can be no other love
you're gonna feel no other love
what if i break into your heart
open the lock , take all that you got
what if i hope , never let go
could you turn around , say no
what if i said we're all out of time
could i make up your mind
cause i want to be in your love alone
i want you all for my own
( put your heart on the line )
i want you all for my own
( turn these shadows into light )
drop it all , take a trip
leave the world , like a rocketship
just you and i , no passengers
we can take off if we go fast enough
you got all of me , no love to spare
too much to miss , not enough to share
oh , i want you all for my own
i don't need no other love
there can be no other love
you're gonna feel no other love
what if i break into your heart
open the lock , take all that you got
what if i hope , never let go
could you turn around , say no
what if i said we're all out of time
could i make up your mind
cause i want to be in your love alone
i want you all for my own
( put your heart on the line )
i want you all for my own
( turn these shadows into light )
i want you all for my own
( cause i feel too much to run )
i want you all for my own
i don't need no other love
there can be no other love
never believe , no other love
cause you're gonna feel no other love
i don't need no other love
there can be no other love
you're gonna feel no other love
what if i break into your heart
open the lock , take all that you got
what if i hope , never let go
could you turn around , say no
what if i said we're all out of time
could i make up your mind
cause i want to be in your love alone
i want you all for my own
( put your heart on the line )
i want you all for my own
( turn these shadows into light )
i want you all for my own
( cause i feel too much to run )
i want you all for my own , my own , my own
what if i break into your heart
open the lock , take all that you got
what if i hope , never let go
could you turn around and say no
what if i said we're all out of time
could i make up your mind
cause i want to be in your love alone
i want you all for my own
