all the fallen rap gods , that's the influence i'm under
my shit hit the streets hard as a suicide jumper
so you and i be different , i'm do or die
if you not mahatma gandhi you don't know what to do with my hunger
see half these rappers in the closet , the others skateboarding or slave for a label
show me a free man who ain't morgan
me and my riff raff tip toeing in the same jordans
keep a gun to protect my wild life like a game warden , nigga
i ain't scarface , call me cigar face
stuck between a rock and longbeach because that's a hard place
they told me i was destined to throw the east side out the window
over the challenger during the police car chase
but instead i'm here , getting all of this cheddar
still got the beretta near , still drinking everclear like it's a keg of beer
yelling never fear , while i behead your favorite rapper with shit i said 11 years ago
or fuck it , when i was 11 years old
yeah , a nigga was cold
now i'm giving rappers one shot across the globe
so if you're over the stove cooking rocks , be the next hov
if you're in college and your flow sick , be the next cole
i'm so sick i'm vomiting in consonants , that's for optimal occulence
while i'm knocking some common sense in the noggins of the naysayers
drunk off of 100 shots of confidence
like i was when i dropped the 52 weeks
i was constantly dropping content and conquering all the continents
i'm the roots of that shit like i was signed to ok playa
ok playa , rhyme sayer , pussy layer , excuse my biggie moment
this shit so notorious that i should get diddy on it
while these battle rappers keep talking shit , they don't really want it
because bar for bar , i don't gotta watch the throne , nigga
i'm really on it , too many components for any opponent
crooked is a nigga who can only represent the illest lyrics ever written
getting vivid with prolifics spitting kicking instrumentals in addictive dental , splitting niggas with precision with the lyricism
and a clearer vision it's a bigger mission
when your favorite rapper missing because the nigga is sitting in a ditch
yeaaah ( laughs )
that's because i put them there , bitch
flexing , i need all of my street niggas to know
just because you're flipping the blow and pimping a ho , we ain't no different
i'm gripping the biz and flipping the flow
and between you and me , i can still get it for 22 a key let me know if it's a go
i'm just a real nigga with heart
like a casting agent for female impersonators
i pick bitch niggas apart
ditch digging's an art
like a stand by flight attendant , i pick which niggas depart
the bigger they are , the harder they fall
the flow is niagara , i'm walking on water. i'm slaughtering you all
cut me , i bleed viagra , i'm harder than y'all
the level of genius this rapper is
that's motherfucking - that's motherfucking - duke ellington at carnegie hall
the fallen rap gods , that's the influence i'm under
my shit hit the streets hard as a suicide jumper
so you and i be different , i'm do or die
if you not mahatma gandhi you don't know what to do with my hunger
y'all taking the game back
y'all taking the game back
whack rappers are taking us back - wards
