you see me as a threat , i'm the reason that you sweat
cuz i know you know i was born to overthrow
everything that you've built to keep my people down
you leave us out depriving me cuz i'm not part of society
where you think we get these guns from ? really ?
where you think all this shit can come from ?
rob the rich while beating on my war drum like buh - rum - pum - pum make them give up the lump sums , bitch
robin hood for the common good
on my worst day , killing a politician i probably would
treat 'em like i'm blowing out a milf's candles on my birthday even wishing his momma would
fuck with me fuck with me
shit that'd make me burn her to the stake like a salem witch
do it for the systematic destruction of lower classes cuz that's what made them rich
chilling up in elysium while we hearing this forsaken ditch
but nothing to make me switch
i eat a laxative sandwich like it's my favorite dish
what i'm really trying to tell you i ain't afraid of shit
nah , especially armed robbery
ghandi said the deadliest form of violence is poverty
and i done seen more than odysseus on his odyssey
so honestly , how can them robocops try to stop a g ?
i remember my first beef with the devil's son
i was only twelve in the park playing with my pellet gun
having hella fun 'till they rolled up on me
and the last thing i remember is them saying , " i want to kill you. "
you see me as a threat , i'm the reason that you sweat
because i know you know i was born to overthrow
everything that you've built to keep my people down
you leave us out depriving me because i'm not part of society
i'm strapped up with two twin desert eagles
and a whole rebellion of people to put an end to your evil ( i want to kill you )
i want to kill you too let the war begin
i'm warning them
yeah my chick is militant
the pistol she concealing in , she looking innocent
the minute she walked by , one of them androids , she's so fly , even they pitch a tent because my bitch is it
but nah she a queen though
she a lady in the streets , in the sheets she the king's hoe
make the squares take a number like it's bingo keeping a pest away like a screen door know what i mean yo ?
we trapped in a whirlwind 2077 bonnie and clyde it's me and my girlfriend
we rock matching tattoos
that's a globe on our middle fingers because fuck the world till the world ends
we playing with the hand that they gave us
the reincarnated marcus garvey and angela davis we savages
that's exactly what the scavengers made us
how can you blame us ? now that we bang hammers we famous , niggas
go on let the king bury em
sleep with the fishes bitches we a - quarium
put 'em on death's dark horse , we kate perry em
we outlaws robin hood and maid marian
until they cop a woman on the block
the robocops pulled her over illegal stop
they hung her in the cell then they took her mug shot
but before her neck popped all she heard was , " i want to kill you. "
i'm knocking on death's door
pen shaking in my hand as i'm writing my manifesto
i'm writing to let the press know
i never wanted you to be afraid of me but society created me and basically made a scarecrow
how can you fear what you sculpted , your chisel was the culprit
your fingerprints are on my gun too
keep it one hundred got sick of being hunted so fuck it i come to hunt you
you tell your kids i'm a monster
never tell them about how many people you kill so you can conquer
tally the numbers it'll shock you
but it don't shock me because i'm a monster nothing could shock blanka
they say i snapped but i didn't snap
i just deprogrammed myself and then i got me some get back
i had to take my own shit back
you put my mind to sleep as a child my brain was kidnapped
as visions started getting clearer
to see myself allowing you to live was getting harder in the mirror
that's when the bodies started disappearing
a mix between leonardo and hitl** 'cause i'm an artist and killer
decorating the city with your blood is hella late for your pity and your love
forever waving a semi in your mug
weapon saying just give me a little tug
let me spray em and leave em in the mud , and i listen to em
the people want a message i'ma give it to em
let the pirate radio station transmit it to em
and when i'm finally struck down by them devils the rebels will still be spreading my message it'll living through em
from my grave i'ma haunt you
a ghost sitting in a dark room , i'ma watch you
and curse all the material things that your wicked ways got you
until you die in the lap of luxury like you ought to
only then will i stop the vendetta , and
realize the afterlife has got to be better
then the hell that you put me through , and this bs
ps : this is not an apology letter. fuck you ! eternally
and now we've come to the point where our rebel leader is at war with himself. perhaps constant conflict has finally taken it's toll. he no longer knows...if he's a hero for the people , or a cold - blooded killer
