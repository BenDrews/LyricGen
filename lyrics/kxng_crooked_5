don't close your eyes , let it be me
don't pretend it's him , in some fantasy
darling just once let yesterday go
and you'll find more love than you've ever known
just hold me tight , when you love me tonight
and don't close your eyes
god , i told myself these are the words i'd never say
i'm my own worst' opponent , and it hurts in every way
you ever thought about smashing the mirrors in your house
so you don't have to see the same person that hurts you every day ? i have...
i'm shattered , can i pick up the pieces before i pick up a piece
and squeeze , and give up on breathing , go live up with jesus
give up , i'm leaving , sick of the freezing rain
switch up the season , the reason , because i need some sunshine
this umbrella i'm under , while it's raining alcohol
see we're abusing each other
i'm just trying to drown my problems in a bottle of jack daniels
let me talk to y'all about a couple of problems i can't handle
see my whole family's starving' , i need dollars to feed 'em
a dropout , nobody college degreed him
i went the block route , where cops play god with your freedom
what's the odds ? i'm going to beat them
all of my friends , man they're gone when i need 'em
the same song plays over and over
my life's bullshit , it's getting older and older
i pour more jack over the soda , told y'all i hate being sober
probably need to meditate with deepak chopra and oprah
i hope for hope , some meaning for tomorrow
and i wish i didn't drink , but ain't no geenie in this bottle
i know , i gotta change and realize i'm highly worth it
but until then , my favorite excuse is " nobody's perfect "
don't close your eyes , let it be me
don't pretend it's him , in some fantasy
darling just once let yesterday go
and you'll find more love than you've ever known
just hold me tight , when you love me tonight
and don't close your eyes
remember when i was a jewel in the lotus flower
swimming around my mother tube on the road to power
fast forward to the current mass horror
at birth i'm hearing the dirt , hit my coffin call the task force
cause i'm empty as this of the bottle of these percocets
i swallowed them to circumvent my problems because i'm purposeless
with my pistol in my hand perspiring
swear i'm like the michelin man i'm so tired if...
if's a 5th then she's a couple pints of gin
you see the struggle fight within for me begin at 5 or 6
i was touched in some ways that no kid should have to talk about
my counselor the reaper seeing if he could bring the chalk around
i can't lie , shit i plotted suicide , every - time i tried
i hear my momma cry , in my one room apartment with an eviction notice
lonely as a runaway among the junkies pimps and homeless
i grip the trigger and the blammer went click
and then i ran into kitchen vomit bread into the dishes
an evangelist is pictured on my samsung so i listen
as he preaches about delilah robbin samson of strength
i guess that i am him , she more or less is my addiction
coalescing with a rhythm like she dancing with the wicked
with the devil two stepping in them tight blue dresses
... in the form of blue pills til death do us
don't close your eyes , let it be me
don't pretend it's him , in some fantasy
darling just once let yesterday go
and you'll find more love than you've ever known
just hold me tight , when you love me tonight
and don't close your eyes
