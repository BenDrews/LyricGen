i'm a flame , you're a fire
i'm the dark in need of light
when we touch , you inspire
feel it changin' me tonight
take me up , take me higher
there's a world not far from here
we can dance in desire
or we can burn in love tonight
our hearts are like firestones
and when they strike , we feel the love
sparks will fly , they ignite our bones
and when they strike , we light up the world
our hearts are like firestones
and when they strike , we feel the love
sparks will fly , they ignite our bones
and when they strike , we light up the world
we light up the world
we light up the world
whoa , oh
world
whoa , oh
firestone
i'm from x
you're from y
perfect strangers in the night
here we are , come together
to the world we'll testify
our hearts are like firestones
and when they strike , we feel the love
sparks will fly , they ignite our bones
and when they strike , we light up the world
our hearts are like firestones
and when they strike , we feel the love
sparks will fly , they ignite our bones
and when they strike , we light up the world
we light up the world
we light up the word
whoa , oh
world
whoa , oh
firestone
