i knew from the moment you came
i've seen in your eyes the dawn of a day
where nothing will ever be the same
feel my heart beating through my chest
i'll get used to just saying " yes "
yes , i'll love you with all i am
yes , tonight is where we began
ooh , i wanna dance with you
ooh , i'll promise to stand for you oh oh oh
ooh ooh ooh i'll do anything for you
oh yeah , oh yeah , tonight , my love all i want
i wanna sing for you
yeah , i'll sing for you
happy birthday , baby
happy birthday to you
happy birthday , baby
happy birthday to you
wrap you in love for the rest of my days
pray you find joy through your pain
i can't protect you from every heartbreak
the world isn't easy that way
but i'll be there for you when you crawl
dad will pick you up when you fall
yes , i'll love you with all i am
yes , tonight is where we began
ooh , i wanna dance with you
ooh , i'll promise to stand for you oh oh oh
ooh ooh ooh i'll do anything for you
oh yeah , oh yeah , tonight , my love all i want
i wanna sing for you
