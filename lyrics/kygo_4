thought i could leave you cause i felt my heart numbing
it hits so deep , i closed my eyes and i just took off running
i turned around and saw the look on your face
so i stayed , stayed
but i don’t need you and you should know that , baby
it'd take a miracle for you to really try and change me
and i feel sorry for the look on your face
so i stayed , stayed
so i stayed , stayed
so i stayed , stayed
you wanna leave her , don’t wanna hurt nobody
i don’t believe a single word you say or that you’re sorry
why can’t i say no to the look on your face ?
i just stay , stay
so i stayed , stayed
so i stayed , stayed
you push me away , push me away
but i always stay , i always stay , yeah
you push me away , push me away
but i always stay , i always stay
but i always stay , i always stay , yeah
you push me away , push me away
but i always stay , i always stay , yeah
you push me away , push me away
but i always stay , i always stay
but will you , will you , will you ?
so i stayed , stayed
so i stayed , stayed
i stay , i stay
oh way , do i stay ?
so i stayed , stayed
