and give me your love
i hope you'll still be there
to pick the pieces up
cause baby i'm fragile , fragile , fragile
cause baby i'm fragile , fragile , fragile
after he left you in ten times ten
could i put you back together again ? yeah
one door closes and another opens
but i won't let go cause i'm not like him
baby just say the words , let the love begin
come take my heart of glass
and give me your love

to pick the pieces up
