tell me that you need me
to help you find a way
through all of this madness
can i be your light of day ?
please , won't you believe me ?
even if you don't agree
know that i am trying
to help us all break free
oh , there'll be nothing left for no one , no
there'll be nothing left for no one
if you don't stop living your life
turned to one side with a blind eye
there'll be nothing left for no one
for no one
i'm saying that i'm sorry
for things i've said and done
but i don't want to be here
if i'm , i'm looking down a gun
oh , there'll be nothing left for no one , no
there'll be nothing left for no one
if you don't stop living your life
turned to one side with a blind eye
there'll be nothing left for no one
for no one
( left for no one )
( left for no one )
( left for no one )
left for no one
left for no one
( left for no one )
( left for no one )
( left for no one )
there'll be nothing left for no one
for no one
