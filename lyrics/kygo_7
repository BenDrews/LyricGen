i'm in love , i'm in love , i'm in love , i'm in love
i'm in love , i'm in love , i'm in love , i'm in love
i'm in love , i'm in love , i'm in love , i'm in love
i'm in love , i'm in love , i'm in love , i'm in love
i'm in love , i'm in love , i'm in love , i'm in love
i'm in love , i'm in love , i'm in love
not enough , i see you waiting
your hands up , your body's shaking
that hard look , i know you're faking
i know you lie , i've seen you lying
with four months in front of me
and now we're same old enemies
it's cold blooded , come back to me
come back to me
i know you couldn't stand to be here on your own
you , you never last without someone to hold
now you're crawling back , you forget what you are
now you and your heart are nothing , your heart
you say you're running back and caught in a lie
say you'd rather die when there's no one to blame
now there's nothing left , you forget what you claim
now you and your heart are nothing , your heart are nothing
i'm in love , i'm in love , i'm in love , i'm in love
i'm in love , i'm in love , i'm in love
i'm in love ( i'm in love ) , i'm in love ( i'm in love )
i'm in love ( i'm in love ) , i'm in love ( i'm in love )
i'm in love ( i'm in love )
it's not enough , i see you waiting
your hands up , your body's shaking
that hard look , i know you're faking
i know you lie , i've seen you lying
with four months in front of me
and now we're same old enemies
it's cold blooded , come back to me
come back to me
i know you couldn't stand to be here on your own
you , you never last without someone to hold
now you're crawling back , you forget what you are
now you and your heart are nothing , your heart
you say you're running back and caught in a lie
say you'd rather die when there's no one to blame
now there's nothing left , you forget what you claim
now you and your heart are nothing , your heart are nothing
i'm in love , i'm in love...
