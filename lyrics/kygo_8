standing in the cold in the frozen wind
i'm leaving you behind but it's not the end
no , no , no
walking on a plain as i hold my breath
it's gonna be weeks 'til i breathe again
no , no , no
i know that you hate it
and i hate it just as much as you
but if you can brave it , i can brave it
brave it all for you
call me anytime that you see the lightning
don't you feel alone , you can always find me
we've got a wild love raging , raging
lost among a million changing faces
every day our hearts keep trading places
we've got a wild love raging , raging
raging , raging
raging , raging
raging , raging
checking into hotel loneliness
it's not what i've been used to , i confess
to wake up three times a night
talking to a stranger's nothing new
she knows how to smile , but not like you
so i wait for you all night
i know that you hate it
and i hate it just as much as you
but if you can brave it , i can brave it
brave it all for you
call me anytime that you see the lightning
don't you feel alone , you can always find me
we've got a wild love raging , raging
lost among a million changing faces
every day our hearts keep trading places
we've got a wild love raging , raging
raging , raging
call me anytime that you see the lightning
don't you feel alone , you can always find me
we've got a wild love raging , raging
rolling on the wind with you forever
holding onto us for worse or better
we've got a wild love raging , raging
raging , raging
raging , raging
call me anytime that you see the lightning
never feel alone , you can always find me
we've got a wild love raging , raging
