we were lovers for the first time
running all the red lights
the middle finger was our peace sign , yeah
we were sipping on emotions
smoking and inhaling every moment
it was reckless and we owned it , yeah , yeah
we were high and we were sober
we were on , we were over
we were young and now i'm older
but i'd do it all again
getting drunk on a train track
way back , when we tried our first cigarettes ( oh )
ten dollars was a flat stack
i'd do it all again ( oh )
bomber jacket and a snapback
your dad's black honda was a maybach ( oh )
re : stacks on the playback
i'd do it all again ( oh )
we were lovers on a wild ride
speeding for the finish line
come until the end of our time , yeah
started off as a wildfire
burning down the bridges to our empire
our love was something they could admire , yeah , yeah
we were high and we were sober
we were on , we were over
we were young and now i'm older
but i'd do it all again
getting drunk on a train track
way back , when we tried our first cigarettes ( oh )
ten dollars was a flat stack
i'd do it all again ( oh )
bomber jacket and a snapback
your dad's black honda was a maybach ( oh )
re : stacks on the playback
i'd do it all again ( oh )
