( last night )
our lovers' quarrel
( i was thinking about you )
hurts more than i can say
( and it was kind of dirty )
all night
( and the way that you looked at me )
help me here ! ( it was kind of nasty , aah ! )
help me here ! ( it was kind of trashy )
'cause i can't help my mind from going there !
heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
wanna meet at my place ?
heard that we both got nothing to do...
when i lay in bed , i touch myself and think of you
last night
damn , you were in my sex dreams ( you were in my )
doing really nasty things ( you were in my dreams )
damn , you were in my sex dreams ( you were in my )
making love in my sex dreams
we could be caught
( i just want this to be perfect )
we're both convicted criminals of thought
( cause i'm broken )
let's white - ( by the one before ) glove the bed
( he was kind of nasty )
help me here !
( and i feel so trashy )
cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads !

don't stop the party ( making love in my sex dreams )
let's keep it naughty , yeah ( making love in my sex dreams )
watch me act a fool ( making love in my sex dreams )
tomorrow when i run into you , tomorrow when i run into you
you could turn to stone
or the color of men petrified by a woman
in love as i am when i lay with you
i think of him , i think of him
i can't believe i'm telling you this , but i've had a couple drinks and...
oh my god !

tomorrow when i run into you ( making love in my sex dreams )
we were in the swimming pool
i was naked , boy , so were you
and we bumped this song while we made love
dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies
and now it's time for the trial with doubts and drawls
