tryin' to get control
pressure’s takin' its toll
stuck in the middle zone
i just want you alone
my guessing game is strong
way too real to be wrong
caught up in your show
yeah , at least now i know
it wasn't love , it wasn’t love
it was a perfect illusion ( perfect illusion )
mistaken for love , it wasn't love
it was a perfect illusion ( perfect illusion )
you were a perfect illusion
i don't need eyes to see
i felt you touchin' me
high like amphetamine
maybe you're just a dream
that's what it means to crush
now that i'm wakin' up
i still feel the blow
but at least now i know
it wasn’t love , it wasn’t love
it was a perfect illusion ( perfect illusion )
mistaken for love , it wasn't love
it was a perfect illusion ( perfect illusion )
where are you ?
cause i can’t see you
it was a perfect illusion
but i feel you watchin' me
dilated , falling free
in a modern ecstasy
where are you ?
cause i can't see you
it was a perfect illusion
but i feel you watchin' me
but i feel you watchin’ me
illusion
but i feel you watchin' me
mistaken for love
where were you
cause i can't see
but i feel you watchin' me
mistaken for love
dilated , falling free
in a modern ecstasy
mistaken for love
in a modern ecstasy
in a modern ecstasy
i'm over the show
yeah at least now i know
it wasn't love , it wasn't love
it was a perfect illusion ( perfect illusion )
mistaken for love , it wasn't love
it was a perfect illusion ( perfect illusion )
you were a perfect illusion
you were a perfect illusion
it was a perfect illusion
somewhere in all the confusion
it was a perfect illusion , illusion ( illusion )
where were you 'cause i can't see it
it was perfect illusion
but i feel you watchin' me , baby
somewhere in all the confusion
dilated , fallin' free
you were so perfect
in a modern ecstasy
you were a perfect illusion
