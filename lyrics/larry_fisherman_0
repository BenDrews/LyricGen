fuckin' trippin'
i'm fuckin' trippin'
yep , yep
aye , can you dim the lights ?
smoke !
sippin' beer and whiskey getting frisky hopscotch
words mistaken this place escapin' my tongue like pop rocks
went to a bar alone , in my lap the glocks cocked
looking for a hot bop with a boyfriend that cock blocks ( faggot )
no service in this bitch , good thing i'm near a hot spot
time is money , clocks flock , like a cherry i'm on top ( hahaha )
you askin' me rhetoricals , knowing where all my morals go
a stampede bitch you plant the seed , let the florals grow
she give me oral throat , good behavior , being cordial
time is money hun , its twentys back into my portal
other words disturb and hurt me absurdly but i'm immortal
thuggish , ruggish , smoke blunts till sluggish , i'm fuckin' durable
adorable , the way these samples flip , thanks to fishy man
he don't give us spam , we the a kitchen clan
river sand , in my bibs , i'm itchy man , finna' hit amoeba
and spent sixtey on lionel richie ( yep ! )
we all gon' die , i might just bring my baby mama with me ( yep )
see , pussy nigga , what’s your life like ? ( huh ? )
‘cause mine’s hype , eyes fixed on the limelight
should’ve signed twice , wrecked five mics ( bitch )
finna eat like an orgy scene with five dykes
weed flight , puffin’ , have to ask " dog , i’m alive , right ? "
a live wire , spit a virus out like limewire
break it down so i can climb higher
in his prime , watch him supply fire
get a grip , i’m going nuts like money mike , supply pliers
ridin' high up in the pied piper
nigga , look at how i’m pissin' on ‘em
mac throw the alley , i blake griffin on 'em
wolf gang , dysfunctional family , eddie griffin on 'em
" high " hats , moving shit , even got diddy on 'em
bitch , i’m a monster
beat it , never leak it , my seed , i skeet in the contra
set cause i bet i wouldn’t play a decent father
they’ll never be a another me , bring seats to my imposters
so haters back that ass up like juvenile
get her suboo while 'bout to do this shit rasputin style
niggas didn’t trip , gave room and i’m a nuisance now
what’s beef ? i’ll bring a meat cleaver to you stupid cows
hot headed , need some heat - seakers to shoot him down
inglewood nigga , just a product of what he grew around
it’s young me , dom’s gettin’ what he fuckin' needs
forever blessed , like bad allergies , you just a fuckin' sneeze
my dreams floated in the wind and grabbed some fuckin' breeze
the crap i spit disgusting , so these ratchets on they fuckin' knees
you niggas save the bullshit , i’m a matador
i’m gettin' swiss cheese overseas by the matterhorn
