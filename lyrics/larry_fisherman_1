don't get too excited...
my last pack was courtesy of b - real from cypress hill
jet fuel , og , and it's death to kill
bet i got some weed - puffy , that's my nigga
we puffin backwoods back to back , back to back
back to back , back to back , i'm a chiropractor , nigga
so high but i'm solo , the horseman on my polo's...
h - o - c , but you don't know , though , i'm just a high nigga
so when you walk by don't say " hi , " nigga , don't !
roll up some more of that money team
( i know you've got some more of that )
rollin' to the chronic , smokin' chronic , all we need's a low - low
picked up an ounce from fountain out in day , it's so astounding
i was on the ground , looked down , now i'm on a mountain
if fair is fair , my strand is rare , i don't know where i grow , though
rollin' up an ozone of this bubba , fuckin' up the ozone
my third i wink at you , you blink , and " poof ! "
like " where he go though ? he ain't even leave the... "
riiiiiight
i knew today would be a great day
i'm a fuckin' buddha - head , i don't take vacays
young high - grade , i'm always in a great space
coughin' up a lung on that kk ( kush )
i'm a harlem nigga , every day's payday
burn it down , vacate - i'm all about that pastry
man , like i'm marketing rev run's daughters
but i'm talkin' 'bout the green with the dead prez' on 'em ( hold up )
and speaking of green , hope you got yours
cause i'm a fiend and it's personal , parties , fuckin' with me ( true story )
hold on to that - you might not get it back
it's all good , though - i'm 'bout to roll another bat
i hit the bay and got some great wax
when they talkin' 'bout loud , i don't hear that
i'm smokin' dope in front of dope on fairfax
jet life nigga , these lear raps
dza
dope burner - layin' a smoke sermon
as the composer close the curtain
i sit back and tell myself that it was all worth it
earth'll morph an ocean , grown surface
matter of fact , fuck that , don't get excited -
it's just another motherfuckin' rap song about weed
so sit back , shut the fuck up , roll your weed
tell your older sister get the money ready
i need a half ounce later
i'm running out... not really , though
it's show time , but it ain't your time
eat a dick...
