still can't seem to figure out
what happens in my head
thought that it was gonna kill me
sick of living with this doubt
this pistol in my head
i could end it all before the morning
summer time always gon' come around
how we waiting for another smile ?
lift my feet off the ground
try to hold on
gravity won't let me go
this gravity won't let me go
this gravity won't let me go
the devil always smile when you need a friend
i'm laying on this cloud
it's a long drive back to earth
wonder where my happy days fade away
don't rain on my parade
if it's only for this moment
so gravity you let me go
so can you please let me go ?
let me go ( oh , woah , woah )
will you let me get higher ?
i just wanna get higher
wanna get higher
say i wanna get higher
say i wanna get higher
let me get higher
i wanna get high
say i wanna get high
can you let me go ?
