turn me up
yeah , let me hit that dope after you man
gangsta gibbs , boldy blocks
let's get it
( verse )
i’m on the first thing smokin' , smokin' on some dope
that i got from out in oakland from my nigga slow motion
with the mac miller's , me and my fam the most dopest
crackin' my drugs , back against the wall , overdosin'
michael jack thriller , eminem to billy ocean
and you know ( ? ) when the going gets tough , the tough gets goin'
all of a sudden , half these niggas candy canin'
and sugarcoating the money they're makin' in the hood for roles
caught up in the moment , never even touched a ho
got 'em on the mild drugs longer then you fuckin notice
i know some youngins quick to up it that's ready to blow
and we don’t play no homegirls , real homephobic
it’s concreatures but you already know the slogan
abbreviate , my appreciation is a token
laughing all the way to the bank , no lackin' or loafin'
keep a couple addicts to get a new packet of dope in
taxin 'em 4 bands , slap 'em with no hands
hand to hand , handin' samples out – that’s free promotion
jealousy is a weak emotion , picture me rollin'
speedboat , by the beach , ocean , at the boat races
( verse )
gangsta g.i. , 87 kush smoke
ship it off and get my pocket used to bust it open
hennessey and coca - cola keep a nigga locin'
slow it up promethazine and fanta , gold potion
pull shit , drug dealer and abuser
i used to get up and crumble the oxycontin and get zooted
sprinkle it in my weed ‘cause i was way too scared to use it
in a movie like a young don , serving heron , shootin
takin' nails out my sock , then in a nigga's pocket
shit is heatin for you bastards
i’m 4 in the morning glockin'
and leave my nigga cop the cola , the soda and yola lockin up
today i slip my feet in new sneakers like mr. rogers biiitch
hold me down , the poster child for pyrex visual
my kitchen now you know the stanky shit be in the air
you buy the first , i front the second , call me in a pair
i said i’m steppin' on a crack , i break these birds off like kevin ware
bitch , uh yea
i said i’m steppin' on a crack , i break these birds off like kevin wear bitch
