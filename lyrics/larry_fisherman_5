don't believe that loser's tale
in music class , only time he used a scale
playing arpeggios , probably sold a little reggie but no blow
yo , that scene is overcrowded
plus i always was a skin but make no bones about it
could buy a pack of shorts , still borrowing bogies for sport
ain't gotta go to long island for a free porter
just look at son's regressions , ask to use his dice money to fund a session
the name’s y - o - d , not lil uzi vert
floozies come to me ass naked in the loosie shirt
we dedicated and playing it tight
not talkin' ‘bout the ball players but i got my brandon wright
even though the fans got no sight
i'm still visible , my jewelry pose light
get busy all night , need y'all to play 42 like a black israelite
i just don't have the payola
but how can you relate , you just a doja ?
a holder , sent for the corner stroll
weed carriers like masta ace , they was born to roll
put you to sleep faster than , yo , revoke your g - pass
but nowadays i'm more about kale , ginger and wheat grass
all that hood shit , let's leave it in the past
it's been damn near a decade since i saw a skimask
we chillin' , eating chilean sea bass
let me ask you , what's your favorite fish ?
i would say the chilean sea bass would be my favorite fish , it taste very good in the teriyaki sauce
