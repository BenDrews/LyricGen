" said everybody got dead homies... "
water comin outta the hydrant/
hybrid of hydra writing violence in the quiet , i ain't staying quiet/
my psyche's in paralysis/
when i ain't battle with the sin inside it's bound to win/
unless i'm callin on christ , like his hands raised/
in the 3rd grade , he's with me on the worst days/
scratch the sur - face , ain't aimin for the first place/
second's where i'm headed , right behind jesus , he's worth eight ( it ) /
scuse me worth it , battle , this a skirmish/
firm bliss inside of our mind is twisting on the firm grips/
my faith's rooted , i'm suited , ready for battle/
against diablo and his cattle , i'm trained to maintain/
in the back , with a mac and i'm packin/
flows hotter than a dragon spewin volcanic acid/
for the lord i'm on my action bronson/
swonson broth , i'm eatin soup/
in my livin room , feet kicked up , automan , hang loose/
kickin it inside this matrix , never stayin complacent/
or basic , i'm pressin on the walls , it ain't faze this/
skinny white teen , from the scummit/
i runnit , like track meet , ain't bluffin , i'm stuntin and i'm roughin 'em up/
in this game that's too vicious to scrimmage/
this a first - class witness oppurtuntiy , i'm vintage/
interest , in the lord that created from the genesis/
me , just like penmanship , i know i'm just a filthy *bleep*/
straight ballin , like spalding , i'm often callin/
on jesus because i'm fallin , this world is garbage i'm takin it out/
to the trash truck , ain't with that bad luck/
tryna cover sin is being gorgeous with a bad tux/
i'm the startin forward , for the dream team/
dunkin over haters that just scream , " leave ! get outta here ! " /
this ain't where you belong , not in the rap game/
well beg your pardon , i'm arthur around the king's round table/
this ain't a fable , i'm a cable to these cars/
help 'em cross the chasm quickly , away from the jafars , i'm aladdin/
packin heat like ovens in my suitcase/
flows that monster mythical beats , my beats my can - vase ( canvas ) /
i'm an artist , paintin mona lisas/
with the 16's that i'm offered , i storm 'em like katrina/
best believe me , better yet believe him/
jesus christ that died and rose in tres , i feel him up in the place/
holy spirit , sin has been staining , yeah he cleared it/
never fear it , even near it , appearance is something beautiful/
a wolf in sheep's skin , deep inside the lion's den/
jehovah's gotta helpin hand , and no , forreal , this ain't pretend/
he's my best friend , the man that i call father/
coach , king and abba , he cleaned me just like a washer/
a spotter , when i'm liftin these weights , the heavy sin bro/
a killer of the evil , murder sequel of diablo/
