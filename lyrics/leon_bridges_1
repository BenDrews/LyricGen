been travelling these wide roads for so long
my heart's been far from you
10 , 000 miles gone
oh , i wanna come near and give you
every part of me
but there is blood on my hands
and my lips are unclean
in my darkness i remember
momma's word reoccur to me :
" surrender to the good lord
and he’ll wipe your slate clean "
take me to your river
i wanna go
take me to your river
i wanna know
dip me in your smooth water
i go in
as a man with many crimes
come up for air
as my sins flow down the jordan
in my darkness i remember
momma's word reoccur to me :
" surrender to the good lord
and he’ll wipe your slate clean "
take me to your river
i wanna go
take me to your river
i wanna know
i wanna go wanna go wanna go
i wanna know wanna know wanna know
wanna go wanna go wanna go
wanna know wanna know wanna know
wanna go wanna go wanna go
wanna know wanna know wanna know
take me to your river
i wanna go
lord please let me know
take me to your river
i wanna know
