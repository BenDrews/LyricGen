i don't want much
i just wanna be a better man
to my baby
meet me off good luck
i was singing with them jezebels
under perfume sheets
got a golden smile , heart overflow
but got us in love , but it wasn't enough
what can i do ? what can i do ?
to get back to your heart
i'd swim the mississippi river
if you would give me another start , girl
all night long i was out
out till the morning
but baby you're tender
lost when i'm longing
baby please , i'm down on my knees begging
i thirst for you girl
baby i'm running to your well
what can i do ? what can i do ?
to get back to your heart
i'd swim the mississippi river
if you would give me another start , girl
what can i do ? what can i do ?
to get back to your heart
i'd swim the mississippi river
if you would give me another start , girl
what can i do ? what can i do ?
to get back to your heart
i'd swim the mississippi river
if you would give me another start , girl
