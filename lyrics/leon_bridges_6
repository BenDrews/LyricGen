lord , don't remember my sins
my sins from my youth
don't remember my sins
and father , please elude my transgressions
let them blow in the wind like sand
cause all of my deeds , you know them
use me as your vessel
i want to shine like the candle
shine like the burning candle in the room
lord , don't remember , ooh , don't remember
and father , please elude my transgressions
let them blow in the wind like sand
cause all of my deeds , you know them
use me as your vessel
i want to shine ( shine ) like the candle
shine like the burning candle in the room
don't remember me as a carnal man walking
i don't wanna be like the israel children
lord , don't remember , ooh , don't remember
my sins from my youth
