flowers of the fields
here today , vanish in the wind
go to sleep , you may not wake up with the morning sunrise
move so fast , baby , right before you close your eyes
so you better run
move fast like the bullet from the gun
over the hills , salvation rests in the sun
eternity , baby , rest in the sun
so won't you come ?
so won't you come , baby ?
so won't you come ?
so won't you come , baby ?
making plans ( ooh , bop , bop , bop ) for tomorrow ( ooh , bop , bop , bop )
even though you don't ( ooh , bop , bop , bop ) don't know your fate ( ooh , bop , bop , bop )
blind eyes ( ooh , bop , bop , bop ) leaning on a whole dead faith ( ooh , bop , bop , bop )
sink your feet into ( ooh , bop , bop , bop ) a concrete foundation ( ooh , bop , bop , bop )
so you better run
move fast like the bullet from the gun
over the hills , salvation rests in the sun
eternity , baby , rest in the sun
so won't you come ?
so won't you come , baby ?
so won't you come ?
so won't you come ?
i wanna tell you ( tell you ) about the good news ( good news )
i wanna tell you ( tell you ) about the good news ( good news )
i wanna tell you ( tell you ) about the good news ( good news )
i wanna tell you ( tell you )
so you better run
move fast like the bullet from the gun
over the hills , salvation rests in the sun
you're turnin' it , baby , rest in the sun
so won't you come ?
so won't you come , baby ?
so won't you come ?
so won't you come , baby ?
