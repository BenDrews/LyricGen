whoa , girl
i wanna ( pull away ) from you
it's been too long
i wanna ( walk away ) right now
i thought that our love was true
but all along , i was wrong
my pillow bears a tear of a man in pain
our love , i thought i could sustain
don't worry about me anymore
cause i'll be gone by the morning time
whoa , girl
i ( poured out my heart ) to you
despite
you put a ( knife in my back ) , straight through
i thought that our love was true
but all along , i was wrong
my pillow bears a tear of a man in pain
our love , i thought i could sustain
don't worry about me anymore
cause i'll be gone by the morning time
i was wrong
i was wrong
i was wrong
i was wrong
i was wrong
