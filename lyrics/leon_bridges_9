i got a call from my baby , said she fed up with me
said she's found another lover in another city
said she's doing fine in new orleans
now she got me pacing , huh , wondering where'd i go wrong
got me going in circles like the merry - go - round
gonna take the west train to louisiana in the morning
sweet little girl from the ninth ward of new orleans
the way she dancing , you could see her from tennessee
up under that red dress are legs long as the bayou trees
she got a golden smile , i know she's the one for me in the room
she's a - twistin' and a - groovin' , shakin' and a - movin'
she don't know what she doin' to me , i
love the way that you dance , and honey , i've got a question :
baby , would you be my queen ?
all right now
her name was eartha was her name , i could never forget
just like the way she dipped on the bronze - tiled floor
honey was movin' with ease , each and every step
so good that baby had my eyes at her glow
no shiny jewelry , still the brightest thing illuminatin' the room
that girl is twistin' and a - groovin' , shakin' and a - movin'
she don't know what she doin' to me , i
love the way that you dance , and honey , i've got a question :
baby , would you be my queen ?
ooh , ooh , baby
ooh , ooh , baby
ooh , ooh , baby
ooh , that baby got a golden smile , i know she's the one for me in that room
that girl is a - twistin' and a - groovin' , shakin' and a - movin'
she don't know what she doin' to me , i
love the way that you dance , and honey , i've got a question :
baby , would you be my queen ?
ooh , ooh , baby
ooh , ooh , baby
ooh , ooh , baby
mmm , that baby got a golden smile , i know she's the one for me in that room
