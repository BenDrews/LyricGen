first it was heaven
everything roses and fire
you and i were golden
now it's armageddon
and i woke up like a fighter
building up a legion
you were rising like a star
reigning like a king
while i was waiting in the wings
and i won't wait any longer
when you left me down , i got stronger
if you wonder 'bout the lightning
i'm on the horizon
well , i'm coming back with the thunder
well , i'm coming back with the thunder
well , i'm coming back with the thunder
( yeah )
scared that you would miss out
scared that i would shine without you
so you held me down , down
but this voice was getting loud
and it just wouldn't give in
cause i was made to sing
and i won't wait any longer
when you left me down , i got stronger
if you wonder 'bout the lightning
i'm on the horizon
well , i'm coming back with the thunder
( with the thunder )
( with the thunder )
well , i'm coming back with the thunder
with an empty heart , i am free again
for some things to start , some have to end
with an empty heart , i am free again
for some things to start , some have to end
and i won't wait any longer
when you left me down , i got stronger
if you wonder 'bout the lightning
i'm on the horizon
well , i'm coming back with the thunder
well , i'm coming back with the thunder
( with the thunder )
( with the thunder )
well , i'm coming back with the thunder
( mmm )
( uuuh )
( mmmhhm )
( mmmhhm )
( uuuh )
( uuuh )
