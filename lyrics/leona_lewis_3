it's been the longest winter without you
i didn't know where to turn to
see , somehow i can't forget you
after all that we've been through
going , coming
thought i heard a knock
who's there ? no one
thinking that i deserve it
now i realize that i really didn't know
if you didn't notice , you mean everything
quickly i'm learning to love again
all i know is i'mma be okay
thought i couldn't live without you
it's gonna hurt when it heals , too ( oh yeah )
it'll all get better in time
and even though i really love you
i'm gonna smile ’cause i deserve to
it'll all get better in time
i couldn't turn on the tv
without something there to remind me
was it all that easy
to just put aside your feelings
if i'm dreaming , don't wanna laugh
hurt my feelings , but that's the path
i believe in , and i know that time will heal it
if you didn't notice , boy , you meant everything
quickly i'm learning to love again
all i know is i'mma be okay
thought i couldn't live without you
it's gonna hurt when it heals , too ( oh yeah )
it'll all get better in time
and even though i really love you
i'm gonna smile ’cause i deserve to
it'll all get better in time
since there's no more you and me ( no more you and me )
it's time i let you go so i can be free
and live my life how it should be ( and i know , and i know )
no matter how hard it is , i'll be fine without you
yes , i will !
thought i couldn't live without you
it's gonna hurt when it heals , too
it'll all get better in time
and even though i really loved you
i'm gonna smile ’cause i deserve to , yes i do
it'll all get better in time
thought i couldn't live without you
it's gonna hurt when it heals , too ( yeah )
it'll all get better in time
and even though i really loved you
gonna smile ’cause i deserve to
