i'll sing it one last time for you
then we really have to go
you've been the only thing that's right
in all i've done
and i can barely look at you
but every single time i do
i know we'll make it anywhere
away from here
light up , light up , as if you have a choice
even if you cannot hear my voice
i'll be right beside you dear
louder louder , and we'll run for our lives
i can hardly speak i understand
why you can't raise your voice to say
to think i might not see those eyes
makes it so hard not to cry
and as we say our long goodbye
i nearly do
light up , light up , as if you have a choice
even if you cannot hear my voice
i'll be right beside you dear
louder louder , and we'll run for our lives
i can hardly speak i understand
why you can't raise your voice to say
light up , light up , as if you have a choice
even if you cannot hear my voice
i'll be right beside you dear
louder louder , and we'll run for our lives
i can hardly speak i understand
why you can't raise your voice to say
