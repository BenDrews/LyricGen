the first time ever i saw your face
i thought the sun rose in your eyes
and the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
to the dark and the empty skies
the first time ever i kissed your mouth
i felt the earth move in my hands
like the trembling heart of a captive bird
that was there at my command my love
the first time ever i lay with you
i felt your heart so close to mine
and i knew our joy would fill the earth
and last , and last , and last till the end of time
the first time ever i saw your face
your face
your face
your face
