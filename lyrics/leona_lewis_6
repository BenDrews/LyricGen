you can say anything you wanna say
hate me , but i'm gonna love you anyway
if you didn't have a wall to hide behind
bet you'd fall to pieces when your eyes met mine
you can throw your daggers , you can sink 'em in
it don't matter , i got thick skin
you can knock me down , but i'll get up again
cause i'm stronger than your bruises , i got thick skin
cause i'm stronger than your bruises , i got thick skin
every time you find another stone to throw
i will pick it up and start to build a wall
keep up your attack because with every blow
you were only adding to my castle
you can throw your daggers , you can sink 'em in
it don't matter , i got thick skin
you can knock me down , but i'll get up again
cause i'm stronger than your bruises , i got thick skin
you can throw your daggers , you can sink 'em in
it don't matter , i got thick skin
you can knock me down , but i'll get up again
stronger than your bruises , i got thick skin
stronger than your bruises , i got thick skin
stronger than your bruises , i got thick skin
