you walked with me , footprints in the sand
and helped me understand where i'm going
you walked with me when i was all alone
with so much unknown along the way
then i heard you say...
i promise you , i'm always there
when your heart is filled with sorrow and despair
i'll carry you when you need a friend
you'll find my footprints in the sand
i see my life flash across the sky
so many times have i been so afraid
and just when i , i thought i'd lost my way
you gave me strength to carry on
that's when i heard you say...
i promise you , i'm always there
when your heart is filled with sorrow and despair
and i'll carry you when you need a friend
you'll find my footprints in the sand
when i'm weary
well , i know you'll be there
and i can feel you when you say...
i promise you , oh , i'm always there
when your heart is filled with sorrow and despair
i'll carry you when you need a friend
you'll find my footprints in the sand
when your heart is full of sadness and despair
i'll carry you when you need a friend
you'll find my footprints in the sand
