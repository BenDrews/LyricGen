heavy words , little lies
telling everything but the truth , the truth
three little words over time overheard and overused , used
no sweet nothing could ever be turned into something new
no grand gesture could ever be made to measure you
i know what i got and i know where we're going
you don't need to show it , i already know it all
it's what you don't do , it's what you don't say
( it's what you don't do ) i know you love me , i don't need proof
it's what you don't do , the games you don't play
( it's what you don't do ) i know you love me , i don't need proof
i've been saving up my time so i could spend it all on you , on you
oh , all i need is to see you smile ; i've forgotten how to be blue , blue
i know what i got and i know where we're going
you don't need to show it , i already know it all
it's what you don't do , it's what you don't say
( it's what you don't do ) i know you love me , i don't need proof
it's what you don't do , the games you don't play
( it's what you don't do ) i know you love me , i don't need proof
don't tell the whole world ; just wanna be your girl
( it's what you don't do , it's what you don't do )
the closer we get , oh
the less we need to show
i know what i got and i know where we're going
you don't need to show it , i already know it all
it's what you don't do , it's what you don't say
( it's what you don't do ) i know you love me , i don't need proof
it's what you don't do , the games you don't play
( it's what you don't do ) i know you love me , i don't need proof
won't tell the whole world ; just wanna be your girl
( it's what you don't do ) i know you love me , i don't need proof
it's what you don't do , it's what you don't say
( it's what you don't do , it's what you don't do )
oh , the closer we get , oh
the less we need to show
