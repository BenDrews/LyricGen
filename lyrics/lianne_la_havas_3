whenever i called you
i couldn't say
it was only yesterday
and yesterday's so far away
what's the eta ?
don't tell me you need me
i am estranged
and i'm over - aged
the trouble it may be
there's still a part of me
that has to know
what you have to say
on and on we go
always with the ghosts of us in tow
stuck somewhere between a friend and foe
round and round we go
oh , round and round again
looking for a life beyond the end
lost somewhere between a foe and friend
round and round again
i should have told you
yes , i'm to blame
oh , i took the blame
turned it into this serenade
oh , the mess i've made
and i should have warned you
what was in store
but i was so so sure
i wasn't haunted anymore
not forevermore
on and on we go
always with the ghosts of us in tow
stuck somewhere between a friend and foe
round and round we go
oh , round and round again
looking for a life beyond the end
lost somewhere between a foe and friend
round and round again
on and on we go
always with the ghosts of us in tow
stuck somewhere between a friend and foe
round and round we go
round and round we go
