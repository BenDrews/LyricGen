come upstairs and i'll show you where all my
where my demons hide from you
just look at who i have become
i'm so ashamed you were the one
that made me feel the way i do
you broke me
and taught me
to truly hate myself
unfold me
and teach me
how to be like somebody else
when i felt strong enough
i was discovered by the love
i had been waiting for so long
you told me none of that was real
i cannot hide how low i feel
to know that you were never wrong
you broke me
and taught me
to truly hate myself
unfold me
and teach me
how to be like somebody else
you're all lost and found
falling out my babe , broken down
broken down
you broke me
and taught me
to truly hate myself
unfold me
and teach me
how to be like somebody else
