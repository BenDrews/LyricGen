did the world get a little bit colder
not wiser just a little bit older
so slow that we're bound to fall over , oh ( hmmmm hmmmm )
did the heart grow a little bit harder
too much , too late , too far , too gone
( hmmm hmmmm hmmmm hmmmm )
but wasn't it kind of wonderful
wasn't it kind of wonderful , baby
wasn't it kind of wonderful , baby
wasn't it kind of wonderful , wonderful
you can trip , flick a switch negative
break the circuit between us
but electricity lingers
in our fingers
oh you can burn every fuse and refuse
turn your positive minus
electricity lingers
in our fingers
from here theres nothing but horizon
near dawn , i'm searching for the sunrise
remember when you put the stars into my eyes , oh
wasn't it kind of wonderful
wasn't it kind of wonderful , baby
wasn't it kind of wonderful , wonderful
you can trip , flick a switch negative
break the circuit between us
but electricity lingers
in our fingers
oh you can burn every fuse and refuse
turn your positive minus
electricity lingers
in our fingers
oh wasn't it kind of wonderful
wasn't it kind of wonderful , baby
wasn't it kind of wonderful , wonderful
oooh wasn't it kind of wonderful
wasn't it kind of wonderful , baby
wasn't it kind of wonderful , wonderful
oooh
