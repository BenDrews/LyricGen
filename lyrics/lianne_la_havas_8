a long and lonely journey
to my hideaway
and i know they'll try to turn me
with the things that they say
but no one knows where i'll go
when i walk away
so come now , hurry hurry
don't miss this train
open up and let me get to you
take you to another side
come to my world ( after midnight )
we're getting lost in another time
your hand in mine
in my own world
on my own time
maybe that's why
( i don't mind )
people think i'm crazy
lately i'm
( i'll be fine )
living in midnight
just living in midnight
( oh oh oh )
and if you think i'm crazy
pay it no mind
( oh oh oh )
we're living in midnight
just living in midnight
if you could see what i've seen
you would dare to dream
honey , if you care to join me
come meet the team
and you all could be my army
there's no other way
so come now , hurry hurry
don't miss this train
( i don't mind )
people think i'm crazy
lately i'm
( i'll be fine )
living in midnight
just living in midnight
( oh oh oh )
and if you think i'm crazy
pay it no mind
( oh oh oh )
you'll never know
the places i go
when i'm alone
if only for a moment
only for a while
cause i belong to the unknown
hope to be alright
( i don't mind )
people think i'm crazy
lately i'm
( i'll be fine )
living in midnight
just living in midnight
and if you think i'm crazy
pay it no mind
living in midnight
just living in midnight
( i don't mind )
people think i'm crazy
lately i'm
( i'll be fine )
living in midnight
just living in midnight
and if you think i'm crazy
pay it no mind
you'll never know
the places i go
when i'm alone
