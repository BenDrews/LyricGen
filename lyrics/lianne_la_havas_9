i am neon
cold neon
not a mystery
all i've ever known is
how to be alone
it comes naturally
oh baby , can i hold you ?
such a cold , cold night
i thought i wouldn't need to
i've got my neon lights
i'm longing just to feel you
to know that it's alright
oh baby baby baby baby
i'm out of sight
i'm out of mind
alone in tokyo
you're out of reach
wrong place , wrong time
alone in tokyo
here i go again
to and fro again
overnight delivery
grew a thicker skin
now it's wearing thin
you can see right into me
oh baby , can i hold you ?
it's a cold , cold night
i thought i wouldn't need to
i've got my neon lights
i'm longing just to feel you
to know that it's alright
oh baby baby baby baby
i'm out of sight
i'm out of mind
alone in tokyo
you're out of reach
wrong place , wrong time
alone in tokyo
i'm out of sight
going out of my mind
alone in tokyo
you're out of reach
wrong place , wrong time
alone in tokyo
oh , in tokyo
