i live it up like these are my last days
if time is money , i'm an hour past paid
ugh , gunpowder in my hourglass
niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
yeah , i put it down like my hands hurting
i'm on a natural high , but i land perfect
some of us are lovers , most of y'all haters
but i put up a wall , and they just wallpaper
so love or hate me , i stay hate - free
they say we learn from mistakes ; why , that's why they mistake me
i got some weight on my shoulders , to me it's like feathers
all hail weezy , call it bad weather
i stick to the script , i memorize the lines
cause life is a movie that i've seen too many times
you're on the outside looking in , close the blinds
and they say never say never , but fuck it , nevermind
i've been gone too long , true or false , right or wrong
hello weezy , welcome home , yeah
i'mma blunt blowin' , polo drawers showin'
i don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
with my money growing , no matter where you going
you don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass , nigga
stunna , i got 'em , i'm back on them bitches
all about my riches , my name should be richard
cut the bullshit out , i'm edward with the scissors
life is a choice , and death is a decision
times have changed , but fuck it get a new watch
i still got the vision like a line between two dots
young money's eating , the label getting fatter
and yea , the tables turned , but i'm still sitting at 'em
i'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
everybody selling dreams , i'm too cheap to buy one
man , when that cookie crumble , everybody want a crumb
shoot that hummingbird down , hummingbird don't hum
yea , big money , big money , deep pockets
money talks , and motherfuckers eavesdropping
bunch of bloods , you could call it blood clotting
eastside , mob piru damu
i'mma blunt blowin' , polo drawers showin'
i don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
with my teeth glowing , i'm on my deebowin'
you don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass , nigga
light that ashton kutcher , i'm a limit pusher
see y'all dead meat , and me i'm just a butcher
i do it for the money , man i am such a hooker
and freedom was my girl , until they fucking took her
you can look into the future , it's right behind your eyelids
but i don't wanna know , cause shit i like surprises
why that , why this , why you on that why shit ?
motherfucker ask me why , i say ym
beach bum , call me ocean drive slim
drop the top , look up and make the sky grin
young mula , skinnies and some supras
belly of the beast 'til it puke us , motherfucker
i'mma blunt blowin' , polo drawers showin'
i don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
with my money growing , no matter where you going
you don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass , nigga
i've been gone too long
true or false , right or wrong
hello weezy , welcome home
it's young mula , baby
