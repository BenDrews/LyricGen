with everything happening today
you don't know whether you're coming or going
but you think that you're on your way
life lined up on the mirror don't blow it
look at me when i'm talking to you
you looking at me but i'm looking through you
i see the blood in your eyes
i see the love in disguise
i see the pain hidden in your pride
i see you're not satisfied
and i don't see nobody else
i see myself , i'm looking at the..
mirror on the wall , here we are again
through my rise and fall , you've been my only friend
you told me that they can understand the man i am
so why are we here talking to each other again
i see the truth in your lies
i see nobody by your side
but i'm with you when you're all alone
and you correct me when i'm looking wrong
i see that guilt beneath the shame
i see your soul through your window pane
i see the scars that remain
i see wayne , i'm lookin' at the..
mirror on the wall , here we are again
through my rise and fall , you've been my only friend
you told me that they can understand the man i am
so why are we here talking to each other again
looking at me now i can see my past
damn i look just like my fucking dad
light it up , that's smoke and mirrors
i even look good in the broken mirror
i see my mama smile that's a blessing
i see the change , i see the message
and no message coulda been any clearer
so i'm starting with the man in the..
mj taught me that
take 'em to mars , man
mirror on the wall , here we are again
through my rise and fall , you've been my only friend
you told me that they can understand the man i am
so why are we here talking to each other again

so why are we , talking to each other again...
