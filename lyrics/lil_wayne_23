uh , my mind’s filled with mine fields
the ashes fall , the wine spills
the world stops , drops and rolls
it’s judgment day or a fire drill
yea , i pour out my heart , have a drink
they say the drunk never lie , they ain’t never lyin' yea
my country 'tis of thee
sweet land of kill em all and let em die
god bless amerika
this ole' godless amerika
i heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
the end of time is like a hour away
damn , military minded , lost and can’t find it
the stars on the flag are never shining
uh , i saw a butterfly in hell today
will i die or go to jail today ?
cause i live by the sword and die by the sword
heard police was lookin' for me , i’mma hide by a broad
shootin' stars in my pocket. bitch , sit on my rocket
i’m wired out the socket , but still shocking
everybody wanna tell me what i need
you can play a role in my life but not the lead
if there’s food for thought then i’m guilty of greed
mama said take what you want – i took heed yea
now let it breathe , yea
back to life , back to reality
been eating my girl and she’s so sweet , got cavities
granted we do it for vanity not humanity
but what’s appealing to me is under banana trees , love
i go so hard , i tried to pay homage but i was overcharged
ain’t that a bitch ? i’m just a nut tryna bust a nut , in a nut shell
used to say fuck the police , now i say fuck jail
same shit , different air freshener
i don’t play , boy , i ain’t hugh hefner
tryna be a step ahead , but a few feet behind
two fingers to my head , pop ! peace of mind
i be in the cloud , cloud number 9
and i just fucked the clock and let it come to time
it’s a cold world , i put on a mink
there’s a chain of command , i’m the missing link
god bless amerika
this ole' godless amerika
i heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
and i’m smoking on them flowers , catch the bouquet
here we live by the sword and die by the sword
heard police was lookin' for me , i’mma hide by a broad
shootin' stars in my pocket. bitch , sit on my rocket
i’m wired out the socket , but still shockin'
everybody wanna tell me what i need
you can play a role in my life but not the lead
i saw a butterfly in hell today
will i die or go to jail today ?
