i got ice in my veins , blood in my eyes
hate in my heart , love in my mind
i seen nights full of pain , days are the same
you keep the sunshine , save me the rain
i search but never find , hurt but never cry
i work and forever try , but i'm cursed , so never mind
and it's worse , but better times seem further and beyond
the top gets higher the more that i climb
the spot gets smaller and i get bigger
tryin' to get in where i fit in , no room for a nigga
but soon for a nigga it be on , motherfucker
â€˜cause all this bullshit done made me strong , motherfucker
so i pick the world up
and i'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
bitch , i'ma pick the world up
and i'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
and i could die now , rebirth , motherfucker
hop up in my spaceship and leave earth , motherfucker
i'm gone , motherfucker , i'm gone
i know what they don't wanna tell you
just hope you're heaven - sent , and you're hell - proof
i walk up in the world and cut the lights off
and confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
my word is my pride
but wisdom is bleak , and that's a word from the wise
served to survive , murdered and bribed
and when it got too heavy i put my burdens aside
so i can pick the world up
and i'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
bitch , i'ma pick the world up
and i'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
and i could die now , rebirth , motherfucker
hop up in my spaceship and leave earth , motherfucker
i'm gone , motherfucker , i'm gone
it hurts , but i never show this pain you'll never know
if only you could see just how lonely and how cold
and frostbit i've become ; my back's against the wall
when push come to shove
i just stand up and scream : " fuck 'em all ! "
man , it feels like these walls are closin' in
this roof is cavin' in , up it's time to raise it , then
your days are numbered like pages in
my book of rhymes ; got 'em cookin' , boy
this crooked mind of mines got 'em all shook
and scared to look in my eyes
i stole that fuckin' clock ; i took the time
and i came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
and butt - fucked this game up
better be careful when you bring my name up
fuck this fame , that ain't what i came to claim
but the game ain't gonna be the same
on the day that i leave it
but i swear , one way or another
i'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
i swear to god , won't spare the rod
i'm a man of my words , so your fuckin' heads better nod
or i'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
sleep on me , that pillow is where your head'll lie
permanently , bitch , it's beddy - bye
this world is my easter egg , yeah , prepare to die !
my head is swole , my confidence is up
this stage is my pedestal
i'm unstoppable ; incredible hulk
you're trapped in my medicine ball
i could run circles around you so fast
your fuckin' head'll spin , dog
i'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives , i'll fuckin'
pick the world up and i'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
bitch , i'ma pick the world up
and i'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
and i could die now , rebirth , motherfucker
hop up in my spaceship and leave earth , motherfucker
i'm gone , motherfucker , i'm gone
