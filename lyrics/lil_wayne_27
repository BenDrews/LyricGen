you who are rich and whose troubles are few
may come around to see my point of view
what price the crown of a king on his throne
when you’re chained in the dark all alone ?
i’m real as they come , i follow the rules
i’m still in the hood but i probably should move
made enough money , i don’t fuck around
i just felt they needed me so i stuck around
feds got my man , shit is real son
cause my godson just became my real son
think life is a game but all you get is a turn
you live and you learn , either you freeze or you burn
kush in the air , i’m pushing the gears
love turned into hate , hate turned into fear
if it ain't right , i don’t sign the deal
shoot me in the watch , i got time to kill
gasoline , propane
ain't no salary cap in the dope game
ain't no collective bargaining on cocaine
so in other words nigga , do your thing
mind in one place heart in another
please pardon my brother , he’s just angry at you niggas
who dont have your heart in your rap shit and got too fuckin comfy
cause we still fuckin hungry , young money , got the munchies
faded , fuckin faded , aww yeah i'm fuckin faded
they tellin’ lies about me , aww yeah i must've made it
rikers island on this flow , 8 months for that pistol
but at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
three visits later , i went and did it major
so fuck the judge , and the jury , and the litigator
watchin all these kids who thought they had it figured out
and then november came , they let my nigga out
stop playin , i ain't with that bullshit
niggas act like bitches , shanaynay , oh my goodness
this is wayne’s world , and y’all are just some tourists
give me three wishes , i wish , i wish , i wish , you would bitch
brand new pussy , pussy good as baby powder
two glock 40′s , nigga you got 80 problems

it's better to give , but we don't give a fuck about 'em
i just came home , shit done got real , ho
lil weezy - ana , the boot nigga , steel toe
i ain't workin with a full deck but i deal ho
i just touched down , kick the motherfucking field goal
talkin ’bout baby money ? i got your baby money
kidnap your bitch , get that " how - much - you - love - your - lady " money
i know you fake nigga , press your brakes nigga
i’ll take you out , that’s a date nigga
i'm a grown ass blood , stop playin with me
play asshole and get an ass whippin’

potato on the barrel , pop pop potato salad
