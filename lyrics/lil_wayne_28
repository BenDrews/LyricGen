( juice 808 )
look what you made me do

i'm sorry for the wait , i'm sorry for the wait ( tell 'em )
tha carter gon' be late so i cooked up a tape ( tell 'em ! )
the garden's full of snakes so i had to escape
lil homie gon' be straight , lil homie gon' be straight !
woo ! ow
and this that sorry 4 the wait 2
yeah , and i'm sorry for the wait too
i told myself to save yourself cause i can't save you
i send my goons to kill somebody , i need head proof
fuck it , this that sorry 4 the wait 2
i ain't trippin ; i got barbie , i got drake too
i send my goons to kill somebody , i need head proof
then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
boop
who kept this shit together ? nigga , me , that's who
who was there when niggas left us ? nigga , me , that's who
cash money is an army , i'm a one man army
and if them niggas coming for me , i'm going out like tony
( bap - bap - bap - bap )
now i don't want no problems , i just want my money
ain't gotta hold no conversation , nor my luggage
tell whoever's counting that i'm on a hundred
woo , birdman junior – more like ugly duckling
taking over , now i'm taking over
think it over ? bitch , i'm thinking forward
i'm sippin lean out a glass , nigga
all i got is young money – no more cash , nigga
and this that sorry 4 the wait 2
no more am i my brother's keeper – cain and abel
young money sharp , i'm still eatin' , i just chipped my tooth
tell them niggas – no love lost , cause i ain't got shit to lose
i told myself to save yourself cause i can't save you
i send my goons to kill somebody , i need head proof
i found the needle in the haystack , put the thread through
i tried to stitch the wound back up , but i just bled through
yeah , it's compensation over conversation
( money talks )
lord i must got blurry vision , a nigga's got two faces
lord , this game is a vampire
blood , you gotta protect your neck
it'll suck you dry like raisins , lord
but fuck that , nigga
got it drawn out
fuck that nigga , i'mma ball out
the day you met me is the day hell froze
on the day i left is when it thawed out
i'm still in the buildin'
i just had to knock a couple walls down
had to kick y'all out
life is a movie
but sometimes a nigga get too tired of watchin'
and walk out
takin' over , lord i'm takin' over
dropped the sorry 4 the wait until the wait is over
sippin' lean out a flask , nigga
and all i do is smoke , fuck , and thrash , nigga !
and this that sorry 4 the wait 2
fuck these haters , throw your board up if you skate too
i send my goons to kill somebody , i need head proof
then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
tunechi – niggas don't appreciate you
you've been down since day one
it meant nothin' on day two
sometimes the truth is hard to swallow
and to say , too
but i graduated from that bullshit
now i hate school
and now i'm takin' over , now i'm takin' over
the old me dead and gone , that's who i'm prayin' over
might have to go back to slangin' yola 'til the wait is over
if so , then i got bakin' soda , i got bakin' soda...
