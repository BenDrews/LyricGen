woo , this that shit they didn’t want me on
i’m ‘bout to act a badonkadonk , shamone , shamone
don't need sugar , i need cream , i'm dark and strong
the garbage man puttin' on cologne , aroma wrong
i'm on , i'm on , this that shit they didn't want
i act a ass and shit a skunk , i will , i won't
black your eye like will.i.am , you willy wonka
that's me in the lam , i'm disappearin' like jimmy hoffa
ak - 47 my business partner , business is swell
french kiss a bitch , she don't speak french , can't kiss and tell
i push his ass in the wishin' well , then wish him well
sippin' syrup like ginger ale , but i'm the quickest snail
from here to hell , i hear them hail , i give them hell
i'm spittin' hail , i'm clinton , well , i did inhale
these niggas frail , they chip and dale , they little girls
watch me act a donkey , then pin a tail , spit out your nails
uh , glory , hallelujah
holy shit , i'm the holy shit , i'm god's manure
i know how to hack a jeweller ward and not computers
i meditate like a buddhist , holy ramen noodles
and now you sleep , i'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
you wake up to this chopper tool , it's like , 'cock - a - doodle'
i'm awkward , cuckoo , i turn your froot loop to chocolate yoo - hoo
i'm hotter than honolulu , glory unto you , glory
i'm awkward , cuckoo , i turn your froot loop to chocolate yoo - hoo
i'm hotter than honolulu , my clothes and socks and shoes new
i been a boo - boo since ga - ga goo - goo and dada , fubu
make everybody that knew you boo - boo , i got them spooked too
i drive in neutral , shock the future like dr. luther
i'm not a chooser , your mom a cougar , i sock it to her
my cocaine white as a white beluga , i like bazookas
i'm high as lunar , i'm wilder than tigers , nikes , pumas
woo , this that shit you didn't want me on
my weed louder than underarms and car alarms
cheers , i said , 'surprise' , but couldn't party long
i got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
but all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
these niggas' soft as teddy bears , talk to marky mark
i wet your block , leave it a waterpark , broad or dark
i whip the work like tartar sauce , you want it hard or raw , huh ?
uh , glory , hallelujah
holy shit , i'm the shit , porta - potty tunechi
unload the glock profusely , when sortin' out confusion
your motor mouth keep vroomin' , i'm goin' tony stewart
i'm on the fluid , i'm ruined , i'm cold as boston bruins
lost in the shoo - shoo and who's who and i lost influence
lost my point of view 'til i find a mirror , start talkin' to it
it told me the truth , it said i'm the shit and you party poopin'
lord , oh , lord
am i talkin' crazy , too much coffee maybe
i smell like money , i know broke niggas feel nauseated
the broads' elated , my boys are faded , my car's the latest
my bars the greatest , they rated x like marvel made it
she caught the babies , she barfed the babies , they orphans maybe
we got that white girl like in the '80s , that marcia brady
i dicked tracy like warren beatty , i'm warm as haiti
i'm armed and lazy , i'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
pardon my mental , i'm higher than continental
went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
that's private , tell the pilot , 'be quiet , we need our privacy'
throw you off this bitch if you wired , justifiably
hustle wit' a motive , you know this , i'm wit' my whoadies
no snakes , no rodents , no ad - libs , no chorus
no stress , no worries , took you to a respiratory
it's self - explanatory , the glory is mandatory , glory
uh , glory , hallelujah
holy shit , i can't hold this shit , my bowel's looser
my towel's newer , my powder room is for powder - users
you see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
my tires lucas , my driver's crusin' , my partner's ruthless
my flower's rootless , my pocket's roofless , she poppin' roofies
i'm not a student , i'm not assumin' i'm not a human
you are not immune to this kind of music , you got 'em , tunechi
you got 'em , tunechi , i got 'em
