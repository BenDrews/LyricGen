six - foot , seven - foot , eight - foot bunch
six - foot , seven - foot , eight - foot bunch
excuse my charisma , vodka with a spritzer
swagger down pat ; call my shit patricia
young money militia and i am the commissioner
you no wan' start weezy ‘cause the 'f' is for finisher
so misunderstood , but what's a world without enigma ?
two bitches at the same time ; synchronized swimmers
got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
never met the bitch , but i fuck her like i missed her
life is the bitch , and death is her sister
sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture !
you know father time , and we all know mother nature
it's all in the family , but i am of no relation
no matter who's buyin' , i'm a celebration
black and white diamonds ; fuck segregation !
fuck that shit , my money up , you niggas just honey nut
young money runnin' shit , and you niggas just runner - ups
i don't feel i done enough , so i'ma keep on doin' this shit
lil tunechi or young tuna fish
six - foot , seven - foot , eight - foot bunch
six - foot , seven - foot , eight - foot bunch
i'm goin' back in…
okay , i lost my mind , it's somewhere out there stranded
i think you stand under me if you don't understand me
had my heart broken by this woman named tammy
but hoes gon' be hoes , so i couldn't blame tammy
just talked to moms , told her she the sweetest
i beat the beat up ; call it self - defense
swear , man , i be seein' through these niggas like sequins
niggas think they he - men , pow , pow , the end
talkin' to myself because i am my own consultant
married to the money , fuck the world ; that's adultery
you full of shit , you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
young money eatin' , all you haters do is add salt
stop playin' , bitch , i got this game on deadbolt
mind so sharp i fuck around and cut my head off
real nigga all day and tomorrow
but these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
glass half empty , half full , i'll spill ya
try me and run into a wall ; outfielder
you know i'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
the fruits of my labor , i enjoy 'em while they still ripe
bitch , stop playin' , i do it like a king do
if these niggas animals , then i'ma have a mink soon
tell 'em bitches i say put my name on the wall
i speak the truth , but i guess that's a foreign language to y'all
and i call it like i see it , and my glasses on
but most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
satisfied with nothin' , you don't know the half of it
young money , cash money
paper chasin' , tell that paper , " look , i'm right behind ya "
bitch , real gs move in silence like lasagna
people say i'm borderline crazy , sorta kinda
woman of my dreams , i don't sleep so i can't find her
you niggas are gelatin , peanuts to an elephant
i got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
yeah , with a swag you would kill for
money too strong ; pockets on bodybuilder
jumped in a wishin' well , now wish me well
tell 'em kiss my ass , call it kiss and tell
word to my mama , i'm out of my lima bean
don't wanna see what that drama mean
get some dramamine
llama scream , hotter than summer sun on a ghana queen
now all i want is hits , bitch , wayne signed a fiend
i played the side for you niggas that's tryna front , and see
son of gun , son of sam , you nigga's the son of me
pause for this dumber speech , i glow like buddha
disturb me , and you'll be all over the flo' like luda
bitch , i flow like scuba , bitch , i'm bold like cuba
and i keep a killer ho , she gon' blow right through ya
i be mackin' , 'bout my stackin' , now i pack like a mover
shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
niggas think they high as i , i come laugh at your ruler
cash money cold , bitch , but our actions is cooler
wayne , these niggas out they mind
i done told these fuck niggas so many times
that i keep them bucks steady on my mind
tuck these , i fuck these on your mind , pause
to feed them , on my grind , did i get a little love
keep throwin' my sign in the middle
hit 'em up , piece on my side
‘cause ain't no peace on my side , bitch
i'm a man , i visit urinals with pride
tune told me to , i'm shootin' when the funeral outside
i'm uptown , thoroughbred , a bx nigga , ya heard ? gunna
