everything i said i'd do , i did
i'm good , i'm good
everything i said i'd do , i did
but baby lets face it , i'm not into dating
i haven't been patient
ever since i been famous my time has been racing
my motives are basic , this life i've been chasing
these hearts i've been breaking
and these girls i been tasting don't never get naked
they like it in a head lock fuck 'em from behind
fuck 'em with their clothes on , put it to the side
feelings to the side like a don do
get 'em wet , let it slide like a sunroof
got goals , got dreams , got a hotel - crib
got niggas that'll die for the prince
got my city on lock , xo 'til the death
left town in a coach came back in a jet
i'm good , i'm not living like i did before
i'm good , i'm good , i said i'm good
everything i said i'd do , i did
i'm good , said i'm good
oh , i been good
i've been out there puttin' down that work
i'm good , said i'm good , i said i'm good
everything i said i'd do , i did
i'm good , motherfucker i'm good
this is dedicated to everybody who forgot
forgetful motherfuckers
remember , don't you remember ?
i been good , we good
