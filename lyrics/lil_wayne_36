cut the music up
a little louder..
you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
never really had luck , couldn’t never figure out
how to love , how to love
you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
now you in a corner tryning put it together
how to love , how to love
for a second you were here , now you over there
it's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
like you never had a love , never had a love
when you was just a young’un , your looks were so precious
but now you're grown up , so fly it's like a blessing
but you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
without you being insecure
you never credit yourself , so when you got older
it seems like you came back ten times over
now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
never really had luck
couldn’t never figure out
how to love , how to love
you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
now you in a corner tryning put it together
how to love , how to love
for a second you were here , now you over there
it's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
like you never had a love , never had a love
you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
the fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
but it wasn’t your fault , wasn't in your intentions
to be the one here talking to me , be the one listening
but i admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
baby , so don’t be mad , nobody else trippin'
you see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook
you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
never really had luck
couldn’t never figure out
how to love , how to love
you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
now you in a corner tryning put it together
how to love , how to love
for a second you were here , now you over there
it's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
like you never had a love , never had a love
see i just want you to know that you deserve the best
you’re beautiful , you’re beautiful
yeah , and i want you to know
you’re far from the usual , far from the usual
you see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
never really had luck
couldn’t never figure out
how to love , how to love
see you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
now you in this corner trying put it together
how to love , how to love
see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
never really had luck
couldn’t never figure out
how to love , how to love
you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
now you in this corner trying put it together
how to love , how to love
