tell me what's it gon' be , this ain't what you want
i call it how i see it , so this ain't what you want
i'm on the road doing shows so well , this ain't what you want
cause the road you can't go i know , this ain't what you want
i hear them niggas after me , but this ain't what you want
and i guarantee this ain't what you want
i'm from the land where ain't no lackin' at , this ain't what you want
i wrap 'em up , we get it done cause , this ain't what you want
niggas claim that they're after me , but this ain't what they want
cause i hopped into this industry , this ain't what they want
see this rap shit ain't shit to me , this ain't what they want
i got the police all into me , this ain't what they want
in my own city they hate on me , put weight on me
fuck tmz , fuck breaking news and abc
i can't do no shows cause i terrify my city
they say i terrify my city
niggas get slumped , you're the first to get blamed
a nigga try us , he the first one to get changed
they say " he snitch " , tryna put dirt on my name
they ride on me ask is lil durk my name ( l's )
tell me what's it gon' be , this ain't what you want
i call it how i see it , so this ain't what you want
i'm on the road doing shows so well , this ain't what you want
cause the road you can't go i know , this ain't what you want
i hear them niggas after me , but this ain't what you want
and i guarantee this ain't what you want
i'm from the land where ain't no lackin' at , this ain't what you want
i wrap 'em up , we get it done cause , this ain't what you want
daddy's doin' life , snitches doin' months
i'm screamin' free the real cause this ain't what you want
a nigga claim 300 , add a k you done
i'm really in the field cause this is what i want
i'mma turn the streets up , this is the anthem
niggas hate on my squad , i tell 'em step they shit up
same since day one and i can't take change up
after all of the gossip , i'll still change sum'n
fuck niggas don't want nothin'
they don't want it
same niggas since day one
