i know you want this for life
taking pictures with all my ice
but i can't have no wife
i just want you for the night
i know you want this for life
taking pictures with all my ice
but i can't have no wife
i just want you for the night

i know you want this for life
taking pictures with all my ice
but i can't have no wife
i just want you for the night
i know you want this for life
taking pictures with all my ice
but i can't have no wife
i just want you for the night
