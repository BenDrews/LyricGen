how does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
somehow defeat a global superpower ?
how do we emerge victorious from the quagmire ?
leave the battlefield waving betsy ross’ flag higher ?
yo. turns out we have a secret weapon !
an immigrant you know and love who’s unafraid to step in !
he’s constantly confusin’ , confoundin’ the british henchmen
ev’ryone give it up for america’s favorite fighting frenchman !
lafayette !
i’m takin this horse by the reins makin’
redcoats redder with bloodstains
lafayette !
and i’m never gonna stop until i make ‘em
drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains , i’m
lafayette !
watch me engagin’ em ! escapin’ em !
enragin’ em ! i’m—
lafayette !
i go to france for more funds
lafayette !
i come back with more
guns
and ships
and so the balance shifts
we rendezvous with rochambeau , consolidate their gifts
we can end this war at yorktown , cut them off at sea , but
for this to succeed , there is someone else we need :
i know
hamilton !
sir , he knows what to do in a trench
ingenuitive and fluent in french , i mean—
hamilton !
sir , you’re gonna have to use him eventually
what’s he gonna do on the bench ? i mean—
hamilton !
no one has more resilience
or matches my practical tactical brilliance—
hamilton !
you wanna fight for your land back ?
i need my right hand man back !
ah ! uh , get ya right hand man back
you know you gotta get ya right hand man back
i mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
to get your right hand man back !


hamilton !
hamilton !
hamilton !
hamilton , hamilton !
ha— ha— !








get your right hand man back !
your right hand man back !
hamilton !
ha—
ha—
hamilton , hamilton !
ha— ha— !
