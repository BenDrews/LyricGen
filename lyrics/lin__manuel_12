i am not throwing away my shot !
i am not throwing away my shot !
hey yo , i’m just like my country
i’m young , scrappy and hungry
and i’m not throwing away my shot !
i’m ‘a get a scholarship to king’s college
i prob’ly shouldn’t brag , but dag , i amaze and astonish
the problem is i got a lot of brains but no polish
i gotta holler just to be heard
with every word , i drop knowledge !
i’m a diamond in the rough , a shiny piece of coal
tryin’ to reach my goal. my power of speech : unimpeachable
only nineteen but my mind is older
these new york city streets get colder , i shoulder
ev’ry burden , ev’ry disadvantage
i have learned to manage , i don’t have a gun to brandish
i walk these streets famished
the plan is to fan this spark into a flame
but damn , it’s getting dark , so let me spell out the name
i am the—
a - l - e - x - a - n - d
e - r—we are—meant to be…
a colony that runs independently
meanwhile , britain keeps shittin’ on us endlessly
essentially , they tax us relentlessly
then king george turns around , runs a spending spree
he ain’t ever gonna set his descendants free
so there will be a revolution in this century
enter me !
( he says in parentheses )
don’t be shocked when your hist’ry book mentions me
i will lay down my life if it sets us free
eventually , you’ll see my ascendancy
and i am not throwing away
my shot
i am not throwing away
my shot
hey yo , i’m just like my country
i’m young , scrappy and hungry
and i’m not throwing away my shot

my shot !
my shot !
and i’m not throwing away my shot.

i am not throwing away my shot
i am not throwing away my shot
hey yo , i’m just like my country
i’m young , scrappy and hungry
and i’m not throwing away my shot
it’s time to take a shot !
i dream of life without a monarchy
the unrest in france will lead to ‘onarchy ?
‘onarchy ? how you say , how you say , ‘anarchy ? ’
when i fight , i make the other side panicky
with my—
shot !
yo , i’m a tailor’s apprentice
and i got y’all knuckleheads in loco parentis
i’m joining the rebellion cuz i know it’s my chance
to socially advance , instead of sewin’ some pants !
i’m gonna take a—
shot !
but we’ll never be truly free
until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
you and i. do or die. wait till i sally in
on a stallion with the first black battalion
have another—
shot !
geniuses , lower your voices
you keep out of trouble and you double your choices
i’m with you , but the situation is fraught
you’ve got to be carefully taught :
if you talk , you’re gonna get shot !
burr , check what we got
mister lafayette , hard rock like lancelot
i think your pants look hot
laurens , i like you a lot
let’s hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin’ the pot...
what are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
poppin’ a squat on conventional wisdom , like it or not
a bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists ?
give me a position , show me where the ammunition is !
oh , am i talkin’ too loud ?
sometimes i get over excited , shoot off at the mouth
i never had a group of friends before
i promise that i’ll make y’all proud
let’s get this guy in front of a crowd
i am not throwing away my shot
i am not throwing away my shot
hey yo , i’m just like my country
i’m young , scrappy and hungry
and i’m not throwing away my shot
i am not throwing away my shot
i am not throwing away my shot
hey yo , i’m just like my country
i’m young , scrappy and hungry
and i’m not throwing away my shot
ev’rybody sing :

rise up !
when you’re living on your knees , you rise up
tell your brother that he’s gotta rise up
tell your sister that she's gotta rise up
when are these colonies gonna rise up ?
when are these colonies gonna rise up ?
when are these colonies gonna rise up ?
when are these colonies gonna rise up ?
rise up !

whoa ! whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
rise up !

i imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
when’s it gonna get me ?
in my sleep ? seven feet ahead of me ?
if i see it comin’ , do i run or do i let it be ?
is it like a beat without a melody ?
see , i never thought i’d live past twenty
where i come from some get half as many
ask anybody why we livin’ fast and we laugh , reach for a flask
we have to make this moment last , that’s plenty
scratch that
this is not a moment , it’s the movement
where all the hungriest brothers with
something to prove went ?
foes oppose us , we take an honest stand
we roll like moses , claimin’ our promised land
and ? if we win our independence ?
is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants ?
or will the blood we shed begin an endless
cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants ?
i know the action in the street is excitin’
but jesus , between all the bleedin’ ‘n fightin’
i’ve been readin’ ‘n writin’
we need to handle our financial situation
are we a nation of states ? what’s the state of our nation ?
i’m past patiently waitin’. i’m passionately
smashin’ every expectation
every action’s an act of creation !
i’m laughin’ in the face of casualties and sorrow
for the first time , i’m thinkin’ past tomorrow
and i am not throwing away my shot
i am not throwing away my shot
hey yo , i’m just like my country
i’m young , scrappy and hungry
and i’m not throwing away my shot
we’re gonna rise up ! time to take a shot !
we’re gonna rise up ! time to take a shot !
we’re gonna
time to take a shot !
time to take a shot !
time to take a shot !
take a shot !
shot !
shot !
a - yo it’s
time to take a shot !
time to take a shot !
and i am—

not throwing away my shot
not throwing away my shot
we’re gonna
rise up !
rise up !
rise up !
rise up !
rise up !
rise up !
ri— ri— ri—
time to take a shot !
time to take a shot !
and i am—

not throwin’ away my—
not throwin’ away my shot !
