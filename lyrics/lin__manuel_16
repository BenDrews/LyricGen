after the war i went back to new york
a - after the war i went back to new york
i finished up my studies and i practiced law
i practiced law , burr worked next door
even though we started at the very same time
alexander hamilton began to climb
how to account for his rise to the top ?
maaaaan , the man is
non - stop !
gentlemen of the jury , i’m curious , bear with me
are you aware that we’re making hist’ry ?
this is the first murder trial of our brand - new nation
the liberty behind
deliberation—
non - stop !
i intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
with my assistant counsel—
co - counsel
hamilton , sit down
our client levi weeks is innocent. call your first witness
that’s all you had to say !
okay !
one more thing—
why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room ?

ev’ry day you fight , like you’re running out of time
keep on fighting. in the meantime—
why do you write like you’re running out of time ?

ev’ry day you fight , like you’re running out of time
non - stop !
corruption’s such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
and nowhere is it stronger than in albany
this colony’s economy’s increasingly stalling and
honestly , that’s why public service
seems to be calling me
he’s just
non - stop !
i practiced the law , i practic’ly perfected it
i’ve seen injustice in the world and i’ve corrected it
now for a strong central democracy
if not , then i’ll be socrates
throwing verbal rocks at these mediocrities
awww !
hamilton , at the constitutional convention :
i was chosen for the constitutional convention !
there as a new york junior delegate :
now what i’m going to say may sound indelicate…
goes and proposes his own form of government !
his own plan for a new form of government !


awwww !

what ?
what ?
talks for six hours ! the convention is listless !
bright young man…
yo , who the f is this ?
why do you always say what you believe ?

alexander ?
aaron burr , sir
it’s the middle of the night
can we confer , sir ?
is this a legal matter ?
yes , and it’s important to me
what do you need ?
burr , you’re a better lawyer than me
okay
i know i talk too much , i’m abrasive
you’re incredible in court. you’re succinct , persuasive
my client needs a strong defense. you’re the solution
who’s your client ?
the new u.s. constitution ?
no
hear me out
no way !
a series of essays , anonymously published
defending the document to the public
no one will read it
i disagree
and if it fails ?
burr , that’s why we need it
the constitution’s a mess
so it needs amendments
it’s full of contradictions
so is independence
we have to start somewhere
no. no way
you’re making a mistake
good night
hey
what are you waiting for ?
what do you stall for ?
what ?
we won the war
what was it all for ?
do you support this constitution ?
of course
then defend it
and what if you’re backing the wrong horse ?
burr , we studied and we fought and we killed
for the notion of a nation we now get to build
for once in your life , take a stand with pride
i don’t understand how you stand to the side
i’ll keep all my plans
close to my chest
i’ll wait here and see
which way the wind
will blow
i’m taking my time
watching the
afterbirth of a nation
watching the tension grow

wait for it , wait for
it , wait…
which way the wind
will blow
i’m taking my time
watching the
afterbirth of a nation
watching the tension grow
i am sailing off to london
i’m accompanied by someone who always pays
i have found a wealthy husband
who will keep me in comfort for all my days
he is not a lot of fun , but there’s no one
who can match you for turn of phrase
my alexander
angelica
don’t forget to write
look at where you are
look at where you started
the fact that you’re alive is a miracle
just stay alive , that would be enough
and if your wife could share a fraction of your time
if i could grant you peace of mind
would that be enough ?
