theodosia writes me a letter every day
i'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
he's on the british side in georgia
he's trying to keep the colonies in line
but he can keep all of georgia
theodosia , she's mine
love doesn't discriminate
between the sinners
and the saints
it takes and it takes and it takes
and we keep loving anyway
we laugh and we cry
and we break
and we make our mistakes
and if there's a reason i'm by her side
when so many have tried
then i'm willing to wait for it
i'm willing to wait for it
my grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher


but there are things that the
homilies and hymns won't teach ya


my mother was a genius

my father commanded respect

when they died they left no instructions
just a legacy to protect




preacher , preacher
preacher




teach ya , teach ya , teach ya





respect , respect













genius
death doesn’t discriminate
between the sinners
and the saints
it takes and it takes and it takes
and we keep living anyway
we rise and we fall
and we break
and we make our mistakes
and if there’s a reason i’m still alive
when everyone who loves me has died
i’m willing to wait for it
i’m willing to wait for it
wait for it
wait for it
wait for it
wait for it
i am the one thing in life i can control
wait for it
wait for it
wait for it
wait for it
i am inimitable
i am an original
wait for it
wait for it
wait for it
wait for it
i’m not falling behind or running late
wait for it
wait for it
wait for it
wait for it
i’m not standing still
i am lying in wait
wait
wait
wait
hamilton faces an endless uphill climb
climb
climb
climb
he has something to prove
he has nothing to lose
lose
lose
lose
lose
hamilton’s pace is relentless
he wastes no time
time
time
time
what is it like in his shoes ?
hamilton doesn’t hesitate
he exhibits no restraint
he takes and he takes and he takes
and he keeps winning anyway
he changes the game
he plays and he raises the stakes
and if there’s a reason
he seems to thrive when so few survive , then goddamnit—
i'm willing to wait for it


i'm willing to wait for it...
