hear ye , hear ye ! my name is samuel seabury
and i present “free thoughts on the
proceedings of the continental congress ! ”
heed not the rabble who scream revolution
they have not your interests at heart
oh my god. tear this dude apart
chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
don’t let them lead you astray
this congress does not speak for me
let him be
they’re playing a dangerous game
i pray the king shows you his mercy
for shame , for shame…
yo !
he’d have you all unravel at the
sound of screams but the
revolution is comin’
the have - nots are gonna
win this
it’s hard to listen to you with a straight face
chaos and bloodshed already haunt us , honestly you shouldn’t even talk. and what about boston ? look at the cost , n’ all that we’ve lost n’ you talk
about congress ? !
my dog speaks more eloquently than thee !
but strangely , your mange is the same
is he in jersey ?
for the revolution !


heed not the rabble
who scream
revolution , they

they’re playing a dangerous game
i pray the king shows you his mercy

heed—
if you repeat yourself again i’m gonna—
scream—
honestly , look at me , please don’t read !

silence ! a message from the king !
a message from the king !
a message from the king !
