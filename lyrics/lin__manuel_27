let me tell you what i wish i’d known
when i was young and dreamed of glory
you have no control :
who lives
who dies
who tells your story ?
president jefferson :
i’ll give him this : his financial system is a
work of genius. i couldn’t undo it if i tried
and i tried
who lives
who dies
who tells your story ?
president madison :
he took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity
i hate to admit it , but he doesn’t get enough credit
for all the credit he gave us
who lives
who dies
who tells your story ?
every other founding father's story gets told
every other founding father gets to grow old
but when you’re gone , who remembers your name ?
who keeps your flame ?
who tells your story ?
who tells your story ?

who tells your story ?
your story ?

eliza
i put myself back in the narrative
eliza
i stop wasting time on tears
i live another fifty years
it’s not enough
eliza
i interview every soldier who fought by your side
she tells our story
i try to make sense of your thousands of pages of writings
you really do write like you’re running out of—
time
i rely on—
angelica
while she’s alive—
we tell your story
she is buried in trinity church
near you
when i needed her most , she was right on—
time
and i’m still not through
i ask myself , “what would you do if you had more—”
time
the lord , in his kindness
he gives me what you always wanted
he gives me more—
time
i raise funds in d.c. for the washington monument
she tells my story
i speak out against slavery
you could have done so much more if you only had—
time
and when my time is up , have i done enough ?
will they tell our story ?
will they tell your story ?

oh. can i show you what i’m proudest of ?
the orphanage
i established the first private orphanage in new york city
the orphanage
i help to raise hundreds of children
i get to see them growing up
the orphanage
in their eyes i see you , alexander
i see you every—
time
and when my time is up
have i done enough ?
will they tell my story ?


will they tell your story ?

oh , i can’t wait to see you again
it’s only a matter of—
time
will they tell your story ?
who lives , who dies , who tells your story ?
will they tell your story ?
who lives , who dies—

time…
time…
time...

who tells your story ?
