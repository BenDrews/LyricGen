there’s nothing like summer in the city
someone under stress meets someone looking pretty
there’s trouble in the air , you can smell it
and alexander’s by himself. i’ll let him tell it
i hadn’t slept in a week
i was weak , i was awake
you never seen a bastard orphan
more in need of a break
longing for angelica
missing my wife
that’s when miss maria reynolds walked into my life , she said :
i know you are a man of honor
i’m so sorry to bother you at home
but i don’t know where to go , and i came here all alone…
she said :
my husband’s doin’ me wrong
beatin’ me , cheatin’ me , mistreatin’ me...
suddenly he’s up and gone
i don’t have the means to go on
so i offered her a loan , i offered to walk her home , she said
you’re too kind , sir
i gave her thirty bucks that i had socked away
she lived a block away , she said :
this one’s mine , sir
then i said , “well , i should head back home , ”
she turned red , she led me to her bed
let her legs spread and said :
stay ?
hey…
hey…
that’s when i began to pray :
lord , show me how to
say no to this
i don’t know how to
say no to this
but my god , she looks so helpless
and her body’s saying , “hell , yes”
whoa...
nooo , show me how to
say no to this
i don’t know how to
say no to this
in my mind , i’m tryin’ to go
go ! go ! go !
then her mouth is on mine , and i don’t say…
no ! no !
say no to this !
no ! no !
say no to this !
no ! no !
say no to this !
no ! no !
say no to this !
i wish i could say that was the last time
i said that last time. it became a pastime
a month into this endeavor i received a letter
from a mr. james reynolds , even better , it said :
dear sir , i hope this letter finds you in good health
and in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
in the pockets of people like me : down on their luck
you see , that was my wife who you decided to
fuuuu—
uh - oh ! you made the wrong sucker a cuckold
so time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
and hey , you can keep seein’ my whore wife
if the price is right : if not i’m telling your wife
i hid the letter and i raced to her place
screamed “how could you ? ! ” in her face
she said :
no , sir !
half dressed , apologetic. a mess , she looked
pathetic , she cried :
please don’t go , sir !
so was your whole story a setup ?
i don’t know about any letter !
stop crying
goddamnit , get up !
i didn’t know any better
i am ruined...
please don’t leave me with him helpless
just give him what he wants and you can have me
whatever you want ,

i am helpless—how could i do this ?
i don’t want you
i don’t want you

if you pay
you can stay
tonight
helpless
whoa !
how can you
say no to this ?
yes
yes
yes
yes.
i don’t…
lord , show me how to
say no to this
i don’t know how to
say no to this
cuz the situation’s helpless
and her body’s screaming , “hell , yes”
no , show me how to
say no to this
how can i
say no to this ?
there is nowhere i can go
when her body’s on mine i do not say…
yes !
yes !
yes !
yes !




say no to this !
say no to this !
say no to this !
say no to this !
go ! go ! go !
no !
say no to this !
no !
say no to this !
no !
say no to this !
no !
say no to this !
say no to this…
i don’t say no to this
there is nowhere i can go.

don’t say no to this
go go go...

so ?
nobody needs to know
