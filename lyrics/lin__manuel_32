the election of 1800
can we get back to politics ?
please ?
yo. ev’ry action has an equal , opposite reaction
john adams shat the bed. i love the guy , but he’s in traction
poor alexander hamilton ? he is missing in action
so now i’m facing—
aaron burr !
with his own faction
he’s very attractive in the north. new yorkers like his chances
he’s not very forthcoming on any particular stances
ask him a question : it glances off , he obfuscates , he dances
and they say i’m a francophile : at least they know i know where france is !
thomas that’s the problem , see , they see burr as a less extreme you
ha !
you need to change course , a key endorsement might redeem you
who did you have in mind ?
don’t laugh
who is it ?
you used to work on the same staff
whaaaat
it might be nice , it might be nice
to get hamilton on your side
it might be nice , it might be nice
to get hamilton on your side
talk less !
smile more !
don’t let ‘em know what you’re against or what you’re for !
shake hands with him !
charm her !
it’s eighteen hundred , ladies , tell your husbands : vote for
burr !

burr !
burr !
burr !
burr !
burr !
burr !
i don’t like adams
well , he’s gonna lose , that’s just defeatist
and jefferson—
in love with france !
yeah , he’s so elitist !
i like that aaron burr !
i can’t believe we’re here with him !
he seems approachable… ?
like you could grab a beer with him !

oh !
the people are asking to hear my voice
oh !
for the country is facing a difficult choice
oh !
and if you were to ask me who i’d promote—
oh !
—jefferson has my vote
oh !
i have never agreed with jefferson once
oh !
we have fought on like seventy - five diff’rent fronts
oh !
but when all is said and all is done
jefferson has beliefs. burr has none
oooooooooooooh
well , i’ll be damned
well , i’ll be damned
hamilton’s on your side
well , i’ll be damned
well , i’ll be damned
and ?
you won in a landslide
congrats on a race well - run
i did give you a fight
uh - huh
i look forward to our partnership
our partnership ?
as your vice - president
ha. yeah , right
you hear this guy ? man openly campaigns against me , talkin’ bout , “i look forward to our partnership.”
it’s crazy that the guy who comes in second gets to be vice president
yeah , you know what ? we can change that. you know why ?
why ?
‘cuz i’m the president. hey , burr , when you see hamilton , thank him for the endorsement
