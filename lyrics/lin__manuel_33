one , two , three , four
five , six , seven , eight , nine…
it’s the ten duel commandments
it’s the ten duel commandments
number one !
the challenge : demand satisfaction
if they apologize , no need for further action
number two !
if they don’t , grab a friend , that’s your second
your lieutenant when there’s reckoning to be reckoned
number three !
have your seconds meet face to face
negotiate a peace…
or negotiate a time and place
this is commonplace , ‘specially ‘tween recruits
most disputes die , and no one shoots
number four !
if they don’t reach a peace , that’s alright
time to get some pistols and a doctor on site
you pay him in advance , you treat him with civility
you have him turn around so he can have deniability
five !
duel before the sun is in the sky
pick a place to die where it’s high and dry
number six !
leave a note for your next of kin
tell ‘em where you been. pray that hell or heaven lets you in
seven !
confess your sins. ready for the moment
of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent
number eight !
your last chance to negotiate
send in your seconds , see if they can set the record straight…

aaron burr , sir
can we agree that duels are dumb and immature ?
sure
but your man has to answer for his words , burr
with his life ? we both know that’s absurd , sir
hang on , how many men died because lee was inexperienced and ruinous ?
okay , so we’re doin’ this
number nine !
look ‘em in the eye , aim no higher
summon all the courage you require
then count
one two three four
five six seven eight nine
number
ten paces !
fire !
