how does the bastard , orphan , son of a whore
go on and on
grow into more of a phenomenon ?
watch this obnoxious , arrogant , loudmouth bother
be seated at the right hand of the father
washington hires hamilton right on sight
but hamilton still wants to fight , not write
now hamilton’s skill with a quill is undeniable
but what do we have in common ? we’re
reliable with the
ladies !
there are so many to deflower !
ladies !
looks ! proximity to power
ladies !
they delighted and distracted him
martha washington named her feral tomcat after him !
that’s true !
1780
a winter’s ball
and the schuyler sisters are the envy of all
yo , if you can marry a sister , you’re rich , son
is it a question of if , burr , or which one ?
hey
