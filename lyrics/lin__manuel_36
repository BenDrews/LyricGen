dear theodosia , what to say to you ?
you have my eyes. you have your mother’s name
when you came into the world , you cried and it broke my heart
i’m dedicating every day to you
domestic life was never quite my style
when you smile , you knock me out , i fall apart
and i thought i was so smart
you will come of age with our young nation
we’ll bleed and fight for you , we’ll make it right for you
if we lay a strong enough foundation
we’ll pass it on to you , we’ll give the world to you
and you’ll blow us all away…
someday , someday
yeah , you’ll blow us all away
someday , someday
oh philip , when you smile i am undone
my son
look at my son. pride is not the word i’m looking for
there is so much more inside me now
oh philip , you outshine the morning sun
my son
when you smile , i fall apart
and i thought i was so smart
my father wasn’t around
my father wasn’t around
i swear that
i’ll be around for you.

i’ll be around for you.

i’ll do whatever it takes
i’ll make a million mistakes
i’ll make the world safe and sound for you…
…will come of age with our young nation
we’ll bleed and fight for you , we’ll make it right for you
if we lay a strong enough foundation
we’ll pass it on to you , we’ll give the world to you
and you’ll blow us all away...
someday , someday
yeah , you’ll blow us all away
someday , someday
