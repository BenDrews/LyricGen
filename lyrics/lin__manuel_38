stay alive…
stay alive…
i have never seen the general so despondent
i have taken over writing all his correspondence
congress writes , “george , attack the british forces.”
i shoot back , we have resorted to eating our horses
local merchants deny us equipment , assistance
they only take british money , so sing a song of sixpence
the cavalry’s not coming
but , sir !
alex , listen. there’s only one way for us to win this
provoke outrage , outright
that’s right
don’t engage , strike by night
remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight
make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight
outrun
outrun
outlast
outlast
hit ‘em quick , get out fast
chick - a - plao !
stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
we’re gonna fly a lot of flags half - mast
raise a glass !
i go back to new york and my apprenticeship
i ask for french aid , i pray that france has sent a ship
i stay at work with hamilton
we write essays against slavery
and every day’s a test of our camaraderie
and bravery
we cut supply lines , we steal contraband
we pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
and ev’ry day
“sir , entrust me with a command , ”
and ev’ry day
no
he dismisses me out of hand
instead of me
he promotes
charles lee
makes him second - in - command :


charles lee.
stay alive...

i’m a general. whee ! ! ! !
yeah. he’s not the choice i would have gone with
he shits the bed at the battle of monmouth
ev’ryone attack !
retreat !
attack !
retreat !
what are you doing , lee ? get back on your feet !
but there’s so many of them !
i’m sorry , is this not your speed ? !
hamilton !
ready , sir !
have lafayette take the lead !
yes , sir !
a thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat
as we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat
charles lee was left behind
without a pot to piss in
he started sayin’ this to anybody who would listen :
washington cannot be left alone to his devices
indecisive , from crisis to crisis
the best thing he can do for the revolution
is turn n’ go back to plantin’ tobacco in mount vernon
oo ! !
don’t do a thing. history will prove him wrong
but , sir !
we have a war to fight , let’s move along
strong words from lee , someone oughta hold him to it
i can’t disobey direct orders
then i’ll do it
alexander , you’re the closest friend i’ve got
laurens , do not throw away your shot
