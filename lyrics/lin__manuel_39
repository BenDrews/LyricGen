look around , look around at how lucky we are
to be alive right now
look around , look around…
how long have you known ?
a month or so
eliza , you should have told me
i wrote to the general a month ago
no
i begged him to send you home
you should have told me
i’m not sorry
i knew you’d fight
until the war was won
but you deserve a chance to meet your son
look around , look around at how lucky we are
to be alive right now.

the war’s not
done.

will you relish being a poor man’s wife
unable to provide for your life ?
i relish being your wife
look around , look around…
look at where you are
look at where you started
the fact that you’re alive is a miracle
just stay alive , that would be enough
and if this child
shares a fraction of your smile
or a fragment of your mind , look out world !
that would be enough
i don’t pretend to know
the challenges you’re facing
the worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind
but i’m not afraid
i know who i married
so long as you come home at the end of the day
that would be enough
we don’t need a legacy
we don’t need money
if i could grant you peace of mind
if you could let me inside your heart…
oh , let me be a part of the narrative
in the story they will write someday
let this moment be the first chapter :
where you decide to stay
and i could be enough
and we could be enough
that would be enough
