helpless !
look into your eyes , and the sky’s the limit i’m helpless !
down for the count , and i’m drownin’ in ‘em
i have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
we were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
laughin’ at my sister as she’s dazzling the room
then you walked in and my heart went “boom ! ”
tryin’ to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
everybody’s dancin’ and the band’s top volume
grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
grab my sister , and
whisper , “yo , this
one’s mine.”
my sister made her way across the room to you
and i got nervous , thinking “what’s she gonna do ? ”
she grabbed you by the arm , i’m thinkin’ “i’m through”
then you look back at me and suddenly i’m
helpless !
oh , look at those eyes
oh !
yeah , i’m
helpless , i know
i’m so into you
i am so into you
i know i’m down for the count
and i’m drownin’ in ‘em.



oooh
oooh
oooh
oooh
helpless !
look into your eyes
and the sky’s the limit
i’m
helpless !
down for the count
and i’m drownin’ in ‘em
i’m helpless !
look into your eyes
and the sky’s the limit i’m helpless !
down for the count
and i’m drownin’ in ‘em.

one week later
i’m writin’ a letter nightly
now my life gets better , every letter that you write me
laughin’ at my sister , cuz she wants to form a harem
i’m just sayin’ , if you really loved me , you would share him

two weeks later
in the living room stressin’
my father’s stone - faced
while you’re asking for his blessin’
i’m dying inside , as
you wine
and dine
and i’m tryin’ not to cry
‘cause there’s nothing that your mind can’t do
my father makes his way across the room
to you
i panic for a second , thinking
“we’re through”
but then he shakes your hand and says
“be true”
and you turn back to me , smiling , and i’m
helpless !
helpless !
hoo !
that boy is mine
that boy is mine !
helpless ! helpless !
down for the count
and i’m drownin’ in em

eliza , i don’t have a dollar to my name
an acre of land , a troop to command , a dollop of fame
all i have’s my honor , a tolerance for pain
a couple of college credits and my top - notch brain
insane , your family brings out a different side of me
peggy confides in me , angelica tried to take a bite of me
no stress , my love for you is never in doubt
we’ll get a little place in harlem and we’ll figure it out
i’ve been livin’ without a family since i was a child
my father left , my mother died , i grew up buckwild
but i’ll never forget my mother’s face , that was real
and long as i’m alive , eliza , swear to god
you’ll never feel so…


eliza…
i’ve never felt so—
my life is gon’ be fine cuz eliza’s in it.

i do i do i do i do !
i do i do i do i do !
hey , yeah , yeah !
i’m down for the count
i’m—
i look into your eyes , and the sky’s the limit
i’m
…drownin’ in ‘em.
helpless !
helpless !
helpless !
down for the count
and i’m drownin’ in ‘em
helpless !
helpless !
helpless !
down for the count
and i’m drownin’ in ‘em.
