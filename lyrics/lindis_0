kestrels breed
looking farther than i can see
without tact to read
she'd take a shine to me
beacon don't fly too high
beacon don't fly too high
for all your time
playful crime in rain
worth it being cold
roofing for the lanes
a lesson lost again
a lesson lost again
cute but i'll take the bus
with fees and favours gone
cracks in savers pass
and a white that sometimes shone
wanton borrowed gun
wanton borrowed gun
