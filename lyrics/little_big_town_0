i gotta girl crush , hate to admit it but
i gotta heart rush , ain’t slowin’ down
i got it real bad , want everything she has
that smile and the midnight laugh she’s givin’ you now
i wanna taste her lips , yeah , ‘cause they taste like you
i wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
i want her long blonde hair , i want her magic touch
yeah , ‘cause maybe then , you’d want me just as much
i gotta girl crush , i gotta girl crush
i don’t get no sleep , i don’t get no peace
thinkin’ about her under your bed sheets
the way that she’s whisperin’ , the way that she’s pullin’ you in
lord knows i’ve tried , i can’t get her off my mind
i wanna taste her lips , yeah , ‘cause they taste like you
i wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
i want her long blonde hair , i want her magic touch
yeah , ‘cause maybe then , you’d want me just as much
i gotta girl crush , i gotta girl crush
i gotta girl crush , hate to admit it but
i gotta heart rush , it ain’t slowin’ down
