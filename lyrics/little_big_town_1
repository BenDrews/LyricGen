i know i’m probably better off on my own
than lovin' a man who didn’t know
what he had when he had it
and i see the permanent damage you did to me
never again , i just wish i could forget when it was magic
i wish it wasn’t 4am , standing in the mirror
saying to myself , you know you had to do it
i know the bravest thing i ever did was run
sometimes , in the middle of the night , i can feel you again
but i just miss you , and i just wish you were a better man
and i know why we had to say goodbye
like the back of my hand
and i just miss you , and i just wish you were a better man
a better man
i know i’m probably better off all alone
than needing a man who could change his mind
at any given minute
and it’s always on your terms
i’m hanging on every careless word
hoping it might turn sweet again
like it was in the beginning
but your jealousy , i can hear it now
you’re talking down to me like i’ll always be around
you push my love away like it’s some kind of loaded gun
boy , you never thought i’d run
sometimes , in the middle of the night , i can feel you again
but i just miss you , and i just wish you were a better man
and i know why we had to say goodbye
like the back of my hand
and i just miss you , and i just wish you were a better man
a better man
better man
i hold onto this pride because these days it’s all i have
and i gave you my best and we both know you can’t say that
you can’t say that
i wish you were a better man
i wonder what we would’ve become
if you were a better man
we might still be in love
if you were a better man
you would’ve been the one
if you were a better man
yeah , yeah
sometimes , in the middle of the night , i can feel you again
but i just miss you , and i just wish you were a better man
and i know why we had to say goodbye
like the back of my hand
and i just miss you and i just wish you were a better man
a better man
better man
we might still be in love , if you were a better man
better man
