i think it's gonna be one of those days
i think it's gonna be one of those days
i'm doing everything right , stepping into the light
that's what i've been waiting for
i think it's gonna be one of those days
i think it's gonna be one of those days
i've got your hand in mine
we're gonna wake up to what we've been waiting for
in the dust , burning sun
need the rain , let it come
oh we pray , come for me
we pray , let it rain
hey , all my sisters and brothers
hey , one foot in front of the other
hey , all of the darkness ending
hey , i see a new beginning
i think it's gonna be one of those days
i think it's gonna be one of those days
i'm doing everything right , stepping into the light
that's what i've been waiting for
i think it's gonna be one of those days
i think it's gonna be one of those days
i've got your hand in mine
we're gonna wake up to what we've been waiting for
there's a sign through the haze
there's a will , there's a way
oh we pray , everyday
we pray , oh we pray
hey , all my sisters and brothers
hey , one foot in front of the other
hey , all of the darkness ending
hey , i see a new beginning
i think it's gonna be one of those days
i think it's gonna be one of those days
i'm doing everything right , stepping into the light
that's what i've been waiting for
i think it's gonna be one of those days
i think it's gonna be one of those days
i've got your hand in mine
we're gonna wake up to what we've been waiting for
hey , hey
hey , hey

hey , hey
hey , all my sisters and brothers
hey , one foot in front of the other
