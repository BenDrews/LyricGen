i want to walk that line a little crooked
and live my life a little on the rocks
laugh at every time my fell
not afraid to make a fool of myself
and keep on dancing when the music stops
because i love being in love
it's the best kind of drug
drunk on the high , leaning on your shoulder
sweeter like a wine as it gets older
when i die i don't want to go sober
oh , when i die , i don't want to go sober
you're like drinking from a never - ending bottle
when i think it's gone there's always a little more left
lay back with you and close my eyes
let the big old world just spin on by
and saying your name with my last breath
oh , when i die , i don't want to go sober
oh , when i die , i don't want to go sober
