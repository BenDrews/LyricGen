happy people don't cheat
happy people don't lie
they don't judge , or hold a grudge , don't criticize
happy people don't hate
happy people don't steal
cause all the hurt sure ain't worth all the guilt they feel
if you wanna know the secret
can't buy it , gotta make it
you ain't ever gonna be it
by takin' someone else's away
never take it for granted
you don't have to understand it
here's to whatever what puts a smile on your face
whatever makes you happy , people
happy people don't fail
happy people just learn
don't think they're above the push and shove
just wait their turn
they always got a hand , or a dollar to spare
know the golden rule or what you're goin' through
even if they never been there
if you wanna know the secret
can't buy it , gotta make it
you ain't ever gonna be it
by takin' someone else's away
never take it for granted
you don't have to understand it
here's to whatever what puts a smile on your face
whatever makes you happy , people
these days ain't always easy to find
they're the ones that you want standing by your side
no time for greed , if they need some , give 'em a slice
and we'll all be happy people
well , life is short
and love is rare
and we all deserve to be happy while we're here
