there's a long stretch of desert through the canyon
and colors painted we ain't ever seen , yeah
i wanna take off runnin' barefoot , wild abandon
just you and me
i just wanna burn , i just wanna burn for you baby
wanna get caught , get caught up in your summertime
whisper in my ear , dreamin' disappear , say you'll take me
where the world unwinds
lost in california
let's chase the waves and let 'em take us under
on some deserted piece of virgin sand , yeah
hold on to the freedom and the wonder
while we can
i just wanna burn , i just wanna burn for you baby
wanna get caught , get caught up in your summertime
whisper in my ear , dreamin' disappear , say you'll take me
where the world unwinds
lost in california
