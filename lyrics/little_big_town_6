i'd like to call you up right now and see how you're doin'
but i don't wanna hurt you anymore so i'll leave you alone
i could tell by the look on your face you didn't see it comin'
i was tryin' to do what's best but damn if it don't feel wrong
i shot the stars out of your sky
took the love right from your eyes
and i did it all knowing you thought , i
was the hero of your heart
but i turned out to be
the breaker
i wish i could give you what you needed
but you can't tell a heart how to feel , but i've tried to
and i made you a promise with no way to keep it
but what kills me the most , i'd still do anything for you
i shot the stars out of your sky
took the love right from your eyes
and i did it all knowing you thought , i
was the hero of your heart
but i turned out to be
the breaker
