don't need no whiskey
when i've had a bad day
no prescription honey
when my skies are grey
no poppin the pills
no smokin the pills
that make me feel okay
but you go down easy baby
i could drink you by the case
you're my painkiller
a little dose of you goes a long long way
you're my painkiller
oh will you take it away
you take it away
don't need no fixin'
i don't need no therapy
you're love drunk kissin
is my kinda remedy
you're always lookin to fall
you're like the hair of the dog
when i'm feelin cursed
don't need no doctor honey
i don't need no nurse
you're my painkiller
a little dose of you goes a long long way
you're my painkiller
oh will you take it away
you take it away
oh you take it away
you take it away
ah la la la la la la la

a little dose of you goes a long long way
