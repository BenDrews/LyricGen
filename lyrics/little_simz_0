this is my story , wait , nah
this is our story , this is our fate
this is our kingdom , this is our place
this is our freedom , cut off them chains
this is our struggle , this is our pain
this is our love , this is our trust
this is our daughters , this is our sons
give me back my wings , yeah
oh
give me back my wings , see , i just wanna fly again
wanna try , fail , try to try again
head up in the stars , i promise i'm higher then
the right person for the job , you hire then fire them
i be working for the same thing , towards the same goal
are we losing the passion in which we came for ?
i was strong but identifying the same flaws
fighting each other but battling for the same cause , let me breathe
ain't got the time to be your enemy
that shit is draining , they're taking up too much energy
i'd rather invest in something that's worth it , the time is precious
so for simz to waste it is something you'll never see , hold me to it
everything is just a memory
it's getting modest then and never modest then , then i remember
i am not fucking about , getting modest is an error
i'll be fine as long as i've got my head up
i ain't prayed in a minute
before you judge me , hold that thought and let me finish
for a long time i thought that praying was just asking for things
like the road to riches and diamond rings
but now i know that i just gotta be thankful
blessings every day , shit , i've got my hands full
lessons every day , i'm learning for more angles
mum , stop stressing over shit that i'mma handle , don't you know ?
simbi got you , i ain't even gotta say it
the album's here , i hope you love it , hope you play it
i know you knew this day would come , i know you prayed it
can't wait to look at you and tell you that i made it
it's amazing
good things come to the people that wait and i waited
tell me , do you believe the quote above i stated ?
nobody handed me a dream , i had to chase it
i had to be business - minded and put aside my feelings
i had to find my own truth , my own meanings
wrote this in the same bedroom i started in
had to dream big , had to look beyond my ceiling
do you feel it ?
hand on my heart , if only you could feel the way it's beating
i mean it
this the type of music that ain't never gonna sell ? well
shouldn't never ever tell me that
should've never ever told me that
what if i prove you wrong ? tell me know , could you live with that ?
no , you wouldn't wanna live that
i ain't saying this'll go to number one , oh , i ain't saying that
i know you know that i ain't saying that
i just wanna do this all for my people , fuck the rest
give you realness every time , nothing more , nothing less , and it goes like
no time for these low - lives
i'm onto something bigger all thanks to the most high
becoming more relentless and less defensive , it's in my mechanism
who give a fucks about cosigns ?
never scared of killing 'em , something that's too real
they don't have to play this , i know that huw will , and you will
no , you can't ignore it
many of us want this life but just ain't cut out for it , yeah
so don't you ever
forget who told you this
no , don't you ever
see , this is for your kids
yeah , don't you ever
overlook this here
so this is our message , this is our faith
this is our voice , this is our names
this is our new , now we want change
this is our sun , this is our rain
this is our wind , this is our fail
this is our hands , how can we help ?
this is our heaven , this is our hell
this is our story , this is our tale , our tale
