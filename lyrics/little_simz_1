we all have our demons
our thoughts , our imperfections and our insecurities
none of which make us inhumane
this is our tale
the proton , the neutron and the electron
the positive , the negative and the ground
the trial , the person , and the story of
do you wanna see a dead body ?
prolly not
real dark in the cemetery
where the souls lie , oh my
what've i become , man i’m so high
quit killing my buzz
love drunk in the maze like , what have you done ?
where the hell are you taking me ?
what are we running from ?
demons in the back of my closet , don’t talk to them
you wouldn’t want to be me , cos i’ve walked with them
and it wasn’t a nice walk ; traumatised
left me in a bad headspace
lookin' to heaven’s door i been saved , or have i ?
asked for forgiveness , can i or will i ?
negative at heart , am i ?
or shall i explain what the world done to me ?
you wouldn’t understand what i been through fully
and these dark thoughts never been new to me
and nobody lovin' me ; everybody through with me
everybody lookin' at me diff'rent
and nobody’ll listen
i can see you starin' at me what do you envision ?
no faith in me , should i resort to religion ?
but even i could never change the life i’m livin'
i’m a druggie ; i’m a fiend
neva' been clean
soul’s always been tainted
homeless ; what'chu know about livin' on the street ?
cold nights ; you know right ? nothin' to eat
figured that you wouldn't give me money anyways , even though i hear the coins rattlin' in your jeans
i ain’t even beggin' no more
fuck it ! maybe i’ll just beg a little more
but don’t judge me
god above me , why do you have me livin' like a junkie ?
fuck !
do you wanna see a dead body ?
prolly not
dark clouds nigga a fuck a rainbow
nobody talk until i say so
i just might sell my soul if it’s worth anything
but , we’ll see how the day goes
i just might sell my soul
cause i dont feel like i am a part of the world no more
will anybody miss me when i’m gone ?
will anybody miss me ?
have you ever seen a dead body ?
prolly not
i'mma sell my soul
cause i dont feel like i am a part of the world no more
will anybody miss me when i’m gone ?

ooo mind’s on overload
hit straight to the face , might overdose
this ain’t the life i chose
what would you know
this ain’t the beginning i ain’t even come close
bare robbing activity indulge
is it very human i don’t think i have a pulse
blacked out in the night nigga
devil on both shoulders , ain't no motherfuckin' angel to my right nigga
have you ever seen , a grown man cry ? never me
shit , i need that nicotine
heals me like medicine
gotta be aware all times
better be dogs out 'ere
lookin' for a diff'rent pedigree
know you see it
never get too comfy
me nuh' trust nobody
feds always wanna roll on me
i ain’t done nuttin' i’m so sorry
you can take time , no hurry
even though that i ain’t slept for days
my body’s achey but my mind’s awake
shit , the flow is crazy , i should rhyme for change
oh dear lady , gimme the time of day
see you a mile away
i can never own up to my mistakes
perhaps it’ll take me to a higher state
no escape , i’m tryin' to find a way
i’m the one that you was tryna save
please give up , you don’t have time to waste
this is real , i’ve been waitin' my whole life to feel
do you wanna see a dead body ? no chill
i just might sell my soul
cause i dont feel like i am a part of the world no more
will anybody miss me when i’m gone ?
