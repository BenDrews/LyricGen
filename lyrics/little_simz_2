oh , broken homes and lonely souls is all they know
all they've shown is courage despite the circumstances
time is passing by , stars command the sky
don't play dumb by asking why
you already know how all the stories involve
came here on my own , former that we leaving alone
put my feet in the studio and call it my home
while others have got no way out
how blessed am i ? nothing left to find
your life's on the line , don't question mine
take my advice , don't stress in life
arms out to you , you can rest your head in mine
i'm prepared to fly with no landing
i might just be the last one standing
they should know that simz ain't ramping
i came to show there's more , i'm expanding
still on my lonesome
give a fuck , i'm chosen
bit of luck and a wish , maybe we'll get there
but for now , i'm zoning
somewhere in the air , i'm floating
they will not control us
this the type of shit that ain't never gonna sell
man , you shouldn't have told us that
nah , you shouldn't have
i'm crawling up these walls
but they won't come down , no , they won't come down
i'm tearing at the core
till their words drown out , till their words drown
clawing at the heart , the trust
you take the little pieces , covering up my soul
i'm just a fool in your game
my life , your prey
i ain't never had a chance to do what i love
ain't nobody ever been encouraging me
i just stay indoors , wishing and dreaming
maybe in another life , it will happen for me
i put all my energy into feeding my kids
do they appreciate the sacrifice i made for 'em ?
no , their daddy ain't around and i have to make up excuses
as to why he hasn't yet came for 'em , oh lord
why did you pick me , lord ?
what is it that you can see in me , lord ?
i'mma write this down , something to report
no air in me , i'm learning to breathe more
how i feel insane , the effect is a glass ceiling
do it cause i love it and not cause i'm tryna make a killing
hell no , saying what i like , you can tell so
and if there's a problem , hit me on my cell phone
know a couple brothers talking through a jail phone
on their best behaviour but still walk it hibernal , shit's fucked
no , i don't owe you nuttin'
talk that talk if you're gonna do something
if i was in this position like a year ago
i probably would've fell off like a year ago
fill my pockets , yeah , it's money that we run alone
but fuck that , tell my people that i'm coming home
i'm coming home , boy
i'm crawling up these walls
but they won't come down , no , they won't come down
i'm tearing at the core
till their words drown out , till their words drown
clawing at the heart , the trust
you take the little pieces , covering up my soul
i'm just a fool in your game
my life , your prey
