they put me down as the one to watch
haters put me down as the one to stop
i can't even lie , tick all of the boxes
still i'm thinking outside the box
you better gimme your mind and let me thoroughly read it
that's food for thought and somebody will feed it
i'm too mature for all of these weaklings
that's strength for days and i'm blessed in ways
that you can never dream of getting like
still i'm hoping for a better life , gimme 25
years and i'll be at mega heights
that's a promise right ?
i promise to always take my advice
but i can't promise
that it'll work for me
simz talk to the younger simz what would you tell her ?
try make a mil 'fore you get a deal
see nothing's impossible long as you keep your head up
and when it comes to the points where you're fed up
take a step back
re - asses where your soul and your head's at
give 'em you like you sent 'em a press pack
in regards to the gifts you should send back
they weren't gifts , they were setbacks
this is real shit
never lie in these real tracks
i'm too grown for that
i'm way too composed for that
what would you say
to the younger you
would you tell you to be patient
would you say to be true ?
sitting here with an empty car
lord knows life’s sobered you up
you always end up as yourself
the world doesn’t need a mold of anybody else
writin till the wheels fall off , crusin’
got this mad fire in my belly , fumin’
barely hear enough about the music
i am not the one you wanna try
i am not the message you imply
when i was on the come up , i was nine
and you was on your arse getting high
now i’m on the spot , ain't time funny how it flies
peek a boo the industry , got ‘em all surprised
i put everybody to bed , nap
your logic thinking ain't practical
i ride the beat , so tactical
simz told me , there’s no regrets
i write it down in capitals
i live by it , give more
cos when its time to take , i ain't shy
i look space , i pass fly
you’re a lost soul in my archive
give it to me
i've been spitting ever since i could remember
enter a new world , but this ain't new to me
they all choose to be similar to one another
that ain't news to me
i’m planning on being here for a long time so you better get use to me
old friends pissed that they can't get through to me
i be setting up a new wave
better thank god you’re seeing a new day
smiley little simz when i’m seeing new faces
really i just wanna build a couple bouquets
guess that’s how it goes now
guess that’s how it goes down
same shit , different day
space space space in my timezone
‘till her singin’ had us all mind blown
swear that kid is fizake
tryna get shit in place
but it's hard when the time tells you
you’re runnin’ a little late
hold on , one second simbi , oh…
still i’m steady killin killin killin killin
hitting i be higher than the ceiling
you can not escape the feelings
in the films , man , i must be the villain
sit back , bill it , then collect my winnings
man i must be a g
sorry i don’t dig your energy
planets in the air is all i see
if i could talk to the younger me
tell her to keep faith and learn to save what you earn
cos money don’t grow on trees , and that’s a fact
money don’t grow on trees now look at that
my soul keeps invincible
my history might be mythical
sometimes i find the world so fictional
style’s analog and you’re digital
and that’s real shit , improvised
you popped up and i minimized
my wolf pack won't compromise
when we see cats then it's dinner time , boy
