verse 1
make believe ain't make believe
well not blatantly
my minds creating my fate for me
don't plan to shoot for stars aimlessly
i plant the seeds in which trees will rise and thats growing old but so gracefully
im meant to be one of the world's great achievers and lead a nation courageously
but i'm , on some other other type shit
try it and my brothers might flip
i ain't a bougie lover type chick
just a get a takeaway and rent a dvd type shit
oh you ain't a stoner try this
put you on a cloud where your brain ain't gotta try think about the shit happening around the world
ain't enough love it's all dimes and pearls
never been a material kinda girl
well its very easy to say but if you throw it my way shit i just might look twice
staring at that item like that watch is alright
no motivation then the boredom strikes
calling up sienna what u saying for tonight
she like i don't know i'm on whatever turn up
im like say nuttin' grip suttin' burn up
pre hook
and thats the mentality
no intuition or sanity
lazy my mother is mad at me
spend money fuck my job salary
eat nigga fuck burning calories
this ain't no pictures in galleries
this is the realness
not about standards
settle for less , settle for less or work hard and be nice in the hamptons
hook
wherever we go we go our soul is here to stay
( settle for less or work hard and be nice in the hamptons )
as long as we know we know to make it count each day
( settle for less , settle for less or work hard and be nice in the hamptons )
make believe ain't make believe you didn't know
if these niggas are the hottest out , i'm queen elizabeth yo
ain't no mastermind could ever master i pass the mic and let me flow
it's just one of them days
backback , headphones , runners and shades
hear it in the bass
we all pray for love
and yet still can't explain it
how the hell does it work i dunno
we need to read above all these lines , that's not in - between at all
but still that won't explain it
gotta figure it out , you feel me
shit's sounding like a movie
like emotionally it really moved me
tryna work out how your seeing through me
what i'm doing is my only duty
to the world and my own community
this is what i choose to be
you should fix up and stop amusing me
still i act a fool with the team
still i act a fool when im lean
i'm just being me
truth is all that we talk about
they wrapped it up when we brought it out and thats
pre hook
and thats the mentality
no intuition or sanity
lazy my mother is mad at me
spend money fuck my job salary
eat nigga fuck burning calories
this ain't no pictures in galleries
this is the realness
not about standards
settle for less , settle for less or work hard and be nice in the hamptons
hook x2
wherever we go we go our soul is here to stay
( settle for less or work hard and be nice in the hampton's )
aslong as we know we know to make it count each day
( settle for less , settle for less or work hard and be nice in the hamptons )
