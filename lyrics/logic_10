i can feel you in my lungs , feel you in my veins
bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
i tried some others but man they just not as good as you
going crazy cause i only feel this good with you
maybe i’m just not as strong as i once was
when we’re together lately i don’t even feel a buzz
i’m addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs
nikki baby i love you but now i gotta go
cause in the end what happens you already know
probably wonder where i been at , i been laying low
but in my mind i’m wondering what i’m paying for
all these other bitches on my dick but i can’t fuck with that
you're the only girl i need i gotta have you back
even though you turn my lungs black
tell me where you been jack
uh , i know this shorty that go by the name of mary
i used to fuck her way back when i didn't know a thing
skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
but when i ended things with her it was just you and me
doing me good , that’s what i thought at first
me and you together , swear to god that’s all that worked
away from you though man it's just so hard to work
uh , my heart is hard at work
we been together like ten years
goddamn , took me as young man
everyday i wonder who i am , who will i be , where will i go
what will they write upon my grave ?
a free man born as a king , who died as a slave
but everything he gave her was for nothing though
oh no i can’t fade that shit i gotta let you go
you got me tripping like a flight to vegas
all this shit you got me doing man it’s outrageous
all i know is i’m living the life i never would
finally let you go , i thought i never could
don’t get me wrong , can’t forget the times shared
seem like everywhere i go , i always know you're there
tried to run but my legs won’t
i look away but my head don’t
i love it when you’re fresh
i love it when i take your top off and we share the same breath
i hate it that i need you , nikki
but i love it when i feed you , nikki
i hate that i bleed for you
uh , i long and i need for you
but i love it when i taste you
nothing can replace you
i wish i could erase you , you’re everywhere i go
but you’re everywhere i long to be
and all these other people that don’t seem to understand
i’m just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me
man you’re everything i crave
you’re the only thing i let in that would put me in the grave
i’m a king , you’re my coretta
but lately i been feeling like a slave for the nicotine
slave for the—
said , i’m a slave for the nicotine
been a slave for ya
i’m a muthafuckin' slave for ya
slave for the nicotine
nikki , nikki , slave for ya
i’m a slave for ya nikki
i’m a muthafuckin' slave for ya
