okay now take a trip inside my mind like you was off to venice
it's me and b - i - g l - n - b - o cookin' like chemists
take them back to way back when , like dennis the menace
causin' mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice
smokin' weed and gettin' higher than a flight attendant
hip - hop descendant , gold jesus on my pendant
got to pull it out for everyone that's in attendance
okay , back in the day as a college park tenant
still can't believe i didn't get a shorty pregnant
man , that's the definition of a life sentence
a whole lot of beef , no bread , no lettuce
cause i couldn't keep it in my briefs , man that's pathetic
fuck all that back and forth , this ain't a game of tennis
i'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate
scared to go outside but i know i can't prevent it
i'm , forever alone in my mind ( yeah yeah )
see i'm a self diagnosed hypochondriac
either at the crib , or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at
yeah , i know that i'm livin' like i got it okay , yeah
but i swear that i'm not that neurotic over here , yeah
over here , over here
over here , over here
over here , over here

stackin' money and playin' the field man like regis
better believe us or leave us
grabbin' your bitch's cleavage like , " woo - hah "
i went from surveyin' to super saiyan slayin' the man
bitches want an autograph , i sign them titties in crayon
like goddamn !
it's me and b - i - g l - n - b - o cookin' like chemists
it's me and b - i , b - i , b - i - g l - n - b - o , l - n - b - o

furthest from evil , i throw this shit back like medieval
i spit at it like a beretta
you know i get better by givin' the people
not a fuck given , check the method , that's how we livin'
always been driven , out of sight and yet never hidden
" the return of the jedi "

ho i said i leave 'em dead , i know i do
this shit is ( overdue , pass me the fifth and i'm comin' through )

ay dios mio , lookin' for a latin leo
to hold a brother down like the white man

even in a pair of cuffs , know we always keep it real
like goddamn , don't even step like i ain't the man
i'm just ( 301 reppin' , second i step in maryland )
i gotta conceal it like a murder weapon
i kept in the glove , ratt pack you know it's all love

throw a molotov in your crib
and tell them bitches to bill us , we the illest
finger fuck a critic
shit is darker than " the chronicles of riddick "

smack you with the palm , save the back for your mom
sound the alarm , you know we got it goin' on
