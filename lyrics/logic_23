tell me how you feel—
i feel like the grass is green
and everything i do is unseen
but i know that’s just in my mind
i know everything is just in my mind
do you really wanna to be famous ?
do you really wanna be a superstar ?
do you really wanna get dangerous ?
do you even know where the groupies are ?
bitches out here be shameless
and i really wonder where they parents are
look around , everything changes
it feels like i've been buried alive
everything happens for a reason
people only in your life for seasons
word to aunt viv ( real shit )
death and taxes that’s all we given
you can make a life but can’t make a livin'
you can make it work but that still ain't driven
give a lot but that still ain't givin
livin' life like this ain’t real though
every night like this i feel so dead wrong
collision is head on , my vision is dead and gone
perception of right and wrong
i been here so very long right here in this very song , uh
look around everything changes
seem like everybody just strangers
don’t go outside cause it’s dangerous
why everybody wanna be famous
i’m so ocd if they notice me
i might jump out the grave so they know it’s me
man everybody want this shit for free
hand out palm up when they get to me
in my mind no i never let it get to me
everybody got a time , will it get to me ?
v’s up motherfucka , that’s victory
tell me why what i’m doing ain’t shit to me , damn
buried alive ( buried alive )
will i survive ? ( buried alive )
i gotta know , i gotta know
it feels like i’ve been buried alive , buried alive
tell me how you feel—
i feel like the grass is green
and everything i do is unseen
but i know that’s just in my mind
i know everything is just in my mind
do you really wanna to be famous ?
do you really wanna be a superstar ?
do you really wanna get dangerous ?
do you even know where the groupies are ?
bitches out here be shameless
and i really wonder where they parents are
look around , everything changes
it feels like i've been buried alive
( let it breathe )
i'm feelin' this villainous feelin inside of my mind
every time that i’m willing i feel like i'm killin' my dreams
when that voice goes nah , nah , nah
listen up now , love it or hate it
never debate it , you can never degrade it
while all these other motherfuckers
probably thinking i made it
my mind jaded , no—i never evade it
i elevate it just to keep it innovative ( innovative )
god damn , bring it back now , blowin' up like iraq now
rattpack put me on the map now
no , we never back down
just take my time , i just take my time
i know , i'mma get it like this
so everyone know that i did it like this
yeah , i know—i'mma take my time
battle the image inside of my mind
i know , i'mma keep going
tell me i can't but i'm already knowing
i know , i'm gonna rise even though i've been—
buried alive ( buried alive )
will i survive ? ( buried alive )
i gotta know , i gotta know
it feels like i've been buried alive , buried alive
tell me how you feel—
i feel like the grass is green
and everything i do is unseen
but i know that’s just in my mind
i know everything is just in my mind
( let it breathe )
