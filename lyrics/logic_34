i know that you think this song is for you
i used to long for you and adore you
my life was just fine way back before you
now when you reach out i just ignore you
cause this ain't a love song ( woah )
this is , " so long "
you did me so wrong for so long
for so long , for so long
no , i never thought i could live my life without you
all you ever seem to do is scream and make it all about you
and so i doubt you
i doubt you even know what's on my mind
i said , i doubt you
i doubt you even know why i left you behind
i know that i've been living
i know that i've been living
i know that i've been living
i know that i've been living
in the city of stars , where there's flying cars
a brand new home for everyone and even life on mars
in the city of stars , where there's flying cars
a brand new home for everyone and even life on mars
this ain't a love song ( woah )
this is , " so long "
you did me so wrong for so long
for so long , for so long
and so i doubt you
i doubt you even know what's on my mind
i said i doubt you
i doubt you even know why i left you—
yeah , uh , yeah...
much love to def jam , even though they under shipped me
did me like bobby did whitney , but the fans was with me
know my name around the world but it still ain't hit me
all the talent in the world and they still don't get me
i didn't talk about my race on the whole first album
but black vs. white bullshit was the still the outcome
how come these motherfuckers can't seem to let it go ?
judging rap by race instead of the better flow
who gives a fuck who made it ? i penetrate it and innovate it
while they emulate it , give a fuck if i'm hated
i'mma do it 'til i get it , fuck a nominated
bitch , i dominate it
yeah , emails from rick rubin , dinner with no id
chilling with b - i - g d - a - double - d - y k - a - n - e
not many get to do what i do , and now enemies
thinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me
but let's get back to the music , i'm gone
outside of this solar system , i'm searching for paradise
livin' the life , bitch , i've been a vet
fuck all these cats on the internet
i love hip hop and i hate hip hop
cause people that love pac hope that drake get shot
cause he raps about money and bitches , for heaven's sakes
pac did the same shit , just on a drum break
now , i ain't wanna name names , i'm just droppin' this game
we all people , all equal—now let me let off , yeah
now let me let off
tougher than raw denim , my flow you can't identify
talib said it best back in the day , we just tryna get by
two words , mos def , in my headphones
black on one side , now i'm in another zone
switch flows , fuck 'em up—play the game , run 'em up
yeah , i sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck
all the people want is real , guess that's why logic appeal
all the power in the world ; hold that , tell me how that feel ?
racism on television and magazines
paying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines , god damn
country don't give a fuck who i am
just a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand
and i am , here's to the roc
the .45 glock that my older brother pop—shot
and i am , finally on top ; too high up , not a drop
stop , we gettin' guap , gettin' guap
i am , livin' like i ain't got it
spit the flow so robotic , man who gives a fuck about it
maryland 'til i die , but i had to get the fuck up out it
i love it and hate it , you probably don't know , man , i doubt it
