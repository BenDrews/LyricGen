living life like this is so crazy , this world is amazing
one day you're on top and the next she having your baby
living life like this i get down , uh , when they come around , uh
i do my best to fall back and not , not make a sound
feel like my mind gone but i'm still here
don't fuck around cause they kill here
this music , it kill fear
i use it , when i need to hear
been there , done that
drop the shit , they gon' run it back
simple shit , man i'm done with that
fake rap , take it back
my chain heavy , got a lot of money
my bitch bad , have fun with that
i've been there and don't want it back
if i see the bitch i might run it back
cause i'm gone , so long , i'm gone , so long
i'm gone , so long , i'm gone , so long , i'm gone
drink , smoke , vibe , fuck , chill , drive , talk , think about it
drink , smoke , vibe , fuck , chill , drive , talk , think about it
so what now ? ( so what now ? )
let's get down—let's get drowned , on this vision
my division is the greatest that's around
feel the vibe ( feel the vibe )
this is where i'mma be for as long as i'm alive
i could vibe with this , fuck around and die for this
but would you ride for this ? better ride , no lie for this
they say " what's your motivation ? "
cutting these records like back in the basement
boy fuck a vacation , we do this for love , not no validation
living like this is so crazy , this world is amazing
one day you're on top and the next she having your baby
living life like this i get down , uh , when they come around , uh
i do my best to fall back and not , not make a sound
i'm gone , so long , i'm gone , so long
i'm gone , so long , i'm gone , so long , i'm gone
drink , smoke , vibe , fuck , chill , drive , talk , think about it
drink , smoke , vibe , fuck , chill , drive , talk , think about it
wanna get it like this
( i think so ) when i'm driving
( i drink slow ) when i'm vibing
( you never know , know , know , know ) ( lets go ! )
i got it , posted up at the crib with something exotic
i don't smoke but she love to smoke
and look good as fuck when she light it
when she ride it , it's crazy , love when i get inside it
baby stop tryna hide it , if the feeling's there then abide it
baby girl , where you been ? i don't know
i feel like this is the moment , i mean it feel like it don't it ?
shit girl i know that you want it—but fuck all that
take the time to get down , stop all that running around
i'm feeling you feeling me , know that you into me
baby girl let me get down , cause my mind gone
that's the type of shit that i'm on
grip the mic and i go ( whoo ! )
fuck around with this flow ( i know )
living like this is so crazy , this world is amazing
one day you're raw on top and the next she having your baby
living life like this i get down , uh , when they come around , uh
i do my best to fall back and not , not make a sound
i'm gone , so long , i'm gone , so long
i'm gone , so long , i'm gone , so long , i'm gone
drink , smoke , vibe , fuck , chill , drive , talk , think about it

making a single before your album is like putting together a trailer for a movie you have yet to shoot...
