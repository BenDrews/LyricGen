somewhere this shit done got crazy
i've just been driving ms. daisy
with my hands on the steering wheel
and my eyes on the pavement
i give a fuck 'bout where they went
i owe my lawyer a payment
they talking 'bout no arraignment
now i wonder where the rain went
i just been all in my mind , homies tell me i'm stressing
i been counting what's on my bucket list
and not on my blessings
i think it's time for a lesson , hold up , you better pay attention
i can't end up like my momma popping anti - depressants
my therapist think i'm crazy , well , shit , she probably does
all that stress i'm under , i wonder why i don't do drugs
raised in a household full of killers and thugs
shit , i've been in doubt so long , don't know who i was
but i know who i am , yes , i know who i is
please pardon my grammar , daisy vibing with this
i've just been driving

that bino the realest , uh , this beat made me kill it , uh
her feet to the ceiling , , she said that she love me
she never said that in college , , 3005 is our mileage
i'm in my lane like a prius , because i'm moving in silence
you still ain't broke down yet ?
all the flashing lights and a couple crown vic's
wanna rock a crown and a ring on the left
tell your nigga speed up , she don't wanna get left
relationships look closer in that rearview
finally slow it down and realize she ain't nowhere near you
so now you gotta stop , park , put that shit in neutral
yeah , you really love her , but is she worth your future ?
your ciara , your beyonc√© , they'll be saying he got money
think that kim be with kanye if he left drive in the driveway ?
yeah , i know who you are , yeah , i know who you is
we were driving together , when we met we were kids
you ain't know 'bout the biz , i ain't know 'bout it either
i see you in that new ride , i flash my lights when i see you
i just be driving
i've just been driving

i've just been driving miss daisy
i've just been driving miss daisy
turn left on west deer park
