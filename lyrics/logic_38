watch my back , so i make sure
you're right behind me as before
yesterday , the night before tomorrow
dry my eyes so you won't know
dry my eyes so i won't show
i know you're right behind me...
don't you let me go , let me go tonight
don't you let me go , let me go tonight
don't you let me go , let me go tonight
don't you let me go , let me go tonight
don't you let me go , let me go tonight
don't you let me go , let me go tonight
yeah , i know we seen a lot of shit whole time we've been together
thought we knew it all but just couldn't predict the weather
i think about you and imagine a house and some kids
and wonder if you found another and it's all his
see baby girl , i know you love me even through the lies
cause honesty and truth is always found within your eyes
sometimes i see you when you love it but you fear it cause you try your hardest to run but still feel me in your spirit baby girl i know you hear it
my heart is calling for you tonight
and even though the time is wrong i know the love is right
that's why there's so much emotion whenever i recite
anything about this angel that lost its sight
baby you were my everything , but you playing games
fucking around got me feeling like blowing my brains
but you ain't worth the satisfaction cause all you do is speak of love but never lead to action
i used to count the days with you but now i just subtract them
you were my best friend but then you out me
i never gave you a reason not to trust me but then you doubt me
so in the end it only shows that you don't give a fuck about me
i know you hearing the emotion that's deep in this letter but i don't give a shit about what you think
i write it so that the people can feel better
that have gone through what i've gone through
memories of a perfect love that's broken and haunt you
and if you think i write this song to taunt you
i don't want you , i want the memory of who you were and what it was to wake up everyday
and have an endless love with an angel from up above
but now it would seem my baby girl has fallen
and another path within my life is calling
cause i put everything below you , ( everything below you )
even my music , and when you left me i didn't lose it
i channeled deep within my emotions and used it
my heart you broke it and bruised it
so now i address this microphone and just ooze it
watch my back , so i make sure
you're right behind me as before
yesterday , the night before tomorrow
dry my eyes so you won't know
dry my eyes so i won't show
i know you're right behind me...
