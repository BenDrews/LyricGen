cause when they coming through that system don't give a fuck about you ( you , you , you )
everybody gonna die , gonna go one day , maybe it'll happen on a monday
driving to work and get hit by a hyundai , fuck it , let it all go one day
i know , i'ma get it like this , living that life while they all reminisce
never regretted , the second i said it i feel like i'm smarter , i read it on reddit
you're fucking pathetic , my etiquette murder ya predicate , bitch i'm ahead of it , yeah

i might just , might just , i don't know

want so much more than this third - dimension
that's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture

but it will hit ya like , " goddamn ! "
going ham , full of all of them
in a spaceship , i’m in another system
so futuristic , on another mission
but back on earth everybody bitchin' , i been in the kitchen
livin' my life—no inhibition , life to death with no intermission
now the good book said we all the same , and we kill each other but it's all in vain
and we all to blame , can't see the picture when it's out the frame
real talk , i wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya , build a family then die richer
when ya get to heaven i'ma come and get ya
sit back and really get the picture
