there's no box to tick for red , so i put down blue instead
'cause it's closest there's to grey in the categories
and the veins within the whites are a statement of demise
doe eyes , you should stay at home licking batteries
and i feel like i'm the host of a terrible game show
and the guests on today's quiz are celebrities
won't respond to any clues , they're just cracking jokes for views
but the answers to these questions mean everything
i had a friend who had made a flag day
blood on their hands from shards of a heartbreak
i have known friends to crack from love's weight
blossom in ribcage , until their backs break
oh , it won't get better
that doesn't mean it's gonna get any worse
you're final draft'a life - long love letter
signed to the man who will be driving your hearse
salacia's in the depths , and if i avoid the nets
threaten , " i'll cuckold you neptune , " for definite
meet between the dog and wolf , with the hoarfrost underfoot
and i'll show you every fire in delphinus
a heart of stone , rind so tough it's crazy
that's why they call me the avocado , baby
may she who casts the first fist of dirt across the casket
have mourners lick the mud from her fingernails
'tween the breadth'a your arms span , i was a renaissance man
books of lies stacked either side , you were my carrell
i had a friend who had made a flag day
blood on their hands from shards of a heartbreak
i have known friends to crack from love's weight
blossom in ribcage , until their backs break
