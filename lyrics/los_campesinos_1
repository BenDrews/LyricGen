i was the first match struck at the first cremation
you are my shallow grave , i'll tend you as a sexton
if you're the casket door that's being slammed upon me
i'll be a plague cross painted on your naked body
well , summer sighed and summoned up hail
dirty in dish rack drips the holy grail
may be heart - slob but i want 'em to know
cut and shut us like a portmanteau
we sit around just spitballing
all the witches cackle 'round my cauldron
recognise the lies from my poker tongue
is it true ?
they say you and me are tautology
what grows from the seeds
can you quite believe ?
through cracks come the weeds
long time listener , first time caller
no need to remind me
what death leaves behind me
why must i lie awake from dusk until the morning
through fear of being impaled upon errant mattress spring ?
within a waking dream , i finally made my heel turn
lived life as super 8 when you were promised hilton
propose me as a pardon for sins
led on barbecue , i'm burnt offerings
i proof - read the book of job for the lord
edit one , league cup 2004
we , delicate as a filigree
cleared a place for us in the chicory
colosseum blood will dry in the sun
is it true ?
they say you and me are tautology
what grows from the seeds
can you quite believe ?
through cracks come the weeds
long time listener , first time caller
no need to remind me
what death leaves behind me
we tread it carefully , we feel around in kid - gloves
what death will leave behind , death will leave behind love
we will flower again , i have surely seen it
we will flower again
they say you and me are tautology
what grows from the seeds
can you quite believe ?
through cracks come the weeds
long time listener , first time caller
no need to remind me
what death leaves behind me
