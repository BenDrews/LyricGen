knees knocking and blood flowing
so , i want you to know
you say you are an old cassette that has gone and spilt its spool
you're far more like a wet cardboard tube on this nightclub toilet floor
as i describe my lonely , you listen very clear
the last set of goalposts taken down , summer of odd - numbered year
she says , " if you're unhappy , then you gotta find the cure "
well , i prescribe me one more beer , beyond that i am unsure
may not be be all and end all , in my defence , she is the hole
i've thrown my goalkeeper forward , she's catenaccio
flotsam , jetsam and spindrift , all the girls i have loved
dumped to earth by a spendthrift , gilt angels from above
and i saw god in the bathroom , i baptised him in sick
embraced him around his cistern , " c'est la mort , enough of this "
knees knocking and blood flowing
so , i want you to know
and later she said something that stuck hard in my mind
" we are their capel celyn , they gotta keep their slippers dry
to empathise with tory's , to invite upon disease
a safer bet's to pack your bags , go holiday in eyam "
i will take you where the sun shines , cast shadows on your face
crawl into their deepest recess , 'til i freeze or dehydrate
we'll live and breathe it in real time , montage is for the dead
and my heart's still doing fosburys , nowhere near finished yet
knees knocking and blood flowing
so , i want you to know
that i want to
knees knocking and blood flowing
so , i want you to know
that i want to
knees knocking and blood flowing
so , i want you to know
that i want to
i want you to know
that i want to
i want you to know
that i want to
