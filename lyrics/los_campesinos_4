there is no blues that can sound quite as heartfelt as mine
lamented at the gorge of the river , i watched it weep its banks dry
i hum the sorriest tune on the bar at these dives
send all the patrons running home to make up with their first wives
( but the low... )
( and to bask... )
( but the low... )
( and to bask... )
my prose is purple but not as pretty as lucerne
for sweet nothings from the lips of a gargoyle , nobody ever yearned
perpetually a philistine , but darling , i am longing to learn
been looked at like the rotten grape on the vine , while you and yours are drinking sauternes
( but the low ) is what i came for
( and to bask ) in a darkness i do adore
( but the low ) is what i came for
( and to bask ) in a darkness i do adore
( but the low ) is what i came for
( and to bask ) in a darkness i do adore
( but the low ) is what i came for
( and to bask ) in a darkness i do adore
i do adore , i do adore , i do adore
i am the magpie's solo , the sorrow that makes you salute
pounding the earth for the early worm , i am a glutton but it's good for my glutes
i was solace to the sirens , the bait on the fisherman's rod
the hook took me far from my family , but closer to god
( but the low ) is what i came for
( and to bask ) in a darkness i do adore
( but the low ) is what i came for
( and to bask ) in a darkness i do adore
( but the low ) is what i came for
( and to bask ) in a darkness i do adore
( but the low ) is what i came for
( and to bask ) in a darkness i do adore
( but the low ) is what i came for
( but the low ) is what i came here for
( but the low ) is what i came for
( but the low ) is what i came here for
