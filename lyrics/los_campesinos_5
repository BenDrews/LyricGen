i found a home away from home
as i broke up in amarante
in the campo do carvalhal
centre circle every day
erratic kamikaze
i co - piloted the swift
dreamt i'm anchoring that midfield
like the anchor in my midriff
i drifted through a month alone
as i broke up in amarante
nursed a two - beer buzz four whole weeks
'cause it's the only way to feel sane
the newspaper front on the counter top
emblazoned spot kick miss
i couldn't even hum in your mother tongue
just a thumbs down raspberry kiss
( it seems unfair ) to be a rotten horn of plenty
( it seems unfair ) to be cadaver for a curse
( it seems unfair ) to be an overflow for empty
( it seems unfair ) to try your best but feel the worst
i threw an empty bottle from way up
it thudded into the maw
truth be told , i spent the afternoon
and i threw fifteen more
i'm woken by a honking horn
hungover , spread - eagle
strength between the clicking crickets' knees
enough to crush my skull
( it seems unfair ) to be a rotten horn of plenty
( it seems unfair ) to be cadaver for a curse
( it seems unfair ) to be an overflow for empty
( it seems unfair ) to try your best but feel the worst
you really can't complain
it's just a holiday
you fill a wall chart out
thirty - one days away
it seems unfair to be a rotten horn of plenty
seems unfair to be...
( nah , i'm gonna need you to help me out here )
( it seems unfair ) to be an overflow for empty
