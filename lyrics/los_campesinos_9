as i swan dive into the estuary
the birds do not flinch at my fall
they perch in the rafters , before , during , after
they do not notice me at all
as i float down into the estuary
wind cases my body in cool
i smell petrol fumes , see the smoke rise in plumes
the earth is one big fireball
the earth is one big fireball
anecdote , lie , my own alibi
i've been telling jokes
piled notes high , my own alibi
i've been selling rope
as i break the film of the estuary
the seaweed submerges my form
no passing cars stop , not a single jaw drops
as my wallet and keys sink before
a splash all i left in the world
anecdote , lie , my own alibi
i've been telling jokes
piled notes high , my own alibi
i've been selling rope
once held a magpie in the palm of my hand
and the blood in our veins flowed faster , as i'd planned
got a heart full of love and a head full of more
but a fist full of threads from the seams
and i saw a smile in that beak
anecdote , lie , my own alibi
i've been telling jokes
piled notes high , my own alibi
i've been selling rope
oh , i was a bird right then , one day i will be again
i've been telling jokes while selling rope to you
oh , i was a bird right then , one day i will be again
i've been telling jokes while selling rope to you
oh , i was a bird right then , one day i will be again
i've been telling jokes while selling rope to you
oh , i was a bird right then , one day i will be again
i've been telling jokes while selling rope to you
there's no ticker - tape , no pearly gates
no carnival and no parade
just one , one for sorrow
there's no ticker - tape , no pearly gates
no carnival and no parade
just one , one for sorrow
