" just one more time "
ronnie williams :
oh yeah !
that's just fine !
come on boys !
just one more time !
spider : i think i can explain about... about how the pigs' music works
monica : well , this should be interesting
spider : remember that they make music with a very dense light. and remember about the smoke standing still and how they... they really get uptight when you try to move the smoke , right ?
monica : right
john : yeah ?
spider : i think the music in that dense light is probably what makes the smoke stand still. any sort of motion has this effect on... on the ponies' manes. you know , the thing on their neck
john : hmm...
spider : as soon as the pony's mane starts to get good in the back any sort of mo... motion , especially of smoke or gas , begins to make the ends split
john : that's the basis of all their nationalism. like if they can't salute the smoke every morning when they get up...
spider : yeah , it's a vicious circle. you got it
" a vicious circle "
gross man : pony !
" drums are too noisy "
larry : drums are too noisy , 'n you've got no corners to hide in !
" kangaroos "
john : so when she's beating him over the nose with a tire iron , and then we both jump away and disappear , and the pig will turn around and there'll be this pony...
spider : oh no , man...
monica : oh...
spider & monica : kangaroos !
monica : and then they eat it when they get home
john : if it's still alive
" envelops the bath tub "
spider : envelops the bath tub
calvin : 'cause round things are... are boring...
