heavy mcs offend me incidentally or directly
i think it's envy
they all want to be me deep down
i ain't friendly , i'm deadly you can ask wesley
i got so many bars i'd have more than you if my memory was empty
but what you know bout deyja on monday
made up a runway for an mc to take off and make gwop
but then the game got mixed with the gunplay
and the police locked the rave off
but me i love making music
so the fame and the money is a bonus
and when it came it came with the rumours
but somehow i remained focused
i keep climbing the ladder of success
and everytime i go a level up it's a different weight ting shoulders , it get's heavier
i still remember spitting at the urban music seminar
there was a couple other cats but they weren't ready for the pit - bull terrier
them man are prey i'm a predator
bet nominee me , chipmunk , giggs and skepta in america
the second i touched down i was in a mall
check what i'm telling ya
when it comes to creps i can't get enough so i got a hell'u'va
collection and my section's swelling up
i been around half of the world
juss cause i wrote bars in the cell on a regular
i never knew who she was
i should have asked her myself when i was in edinburgh
in a cemetry somewhere
after one year on the roads
he met some breh with no care in his bones
the fuck was unfair , cause the breh came there with half his area
but my man never run scared
he might have had a death wish , cause he coulda legged it
but he never so he got left with multiple stab wounds
head , chest , neck slit , that's a next ting
and if i weren't to busy in the pen , getting busy with the pen
that could have been my bredrin
even though i knew a guy was on suicide watch
i was in my cell smoking the ash
eyes red like i was doing eye drops
they might of , never liked us
i was going back to back with other inmates
i'm the reason the whole wing was hyped up
these times i was with wallace and stunnaman
we was both 18 and we had a plan
2003 round jammer's
so many bars in the headtop
listen to lord of the decks part 2 , then you'll know about bangers
my mind works i'm thuggin it out
and a freestyle that louie white made , when i told you niggas i was on a music ting
they thought i was fucking about
years later i'm doseinit now
i'm doseinit now
i'm running this town
no fucking about
i ain't fuckin' around
