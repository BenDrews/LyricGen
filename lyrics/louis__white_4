to the tables down at morey's
to the place where louis dwells
to the dear old temple bar we love so well . .
sing the whiffenpoofs assembled
with their glasses raised on high
and the magic of their singing cast it's spell . .
yes , the magic of their singing
of the songs we love so well
shall l wasting and mavourneen and the rest
we will serenade our louis ! ( we will serenade our louis ! )
while life and voice shall last !
then we'll pass and be forgotten like the rest . .
we're poor little lambs
who have lost our way
baa baa baa !
we're little black sheep
who have gone astray
baa baa baa !
gentlemen songsters off on a spree
( doomed . . . ) doomed from here to eternity
( lord . . . ) lord , have mercy on such as we
baa baa baa !
with george s. pomeroy , 1909 , 1936
