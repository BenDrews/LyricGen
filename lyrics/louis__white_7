it all started on the school bus
you were 9 and i was 10
remember you had a walkman
all i had was a middle part and a pen
oh sweet louise
whatever happened to her ?
then is all went downhill
you grew tall i stayed the same
i guess that's just puberty
making us boys all play a losing game
oh sweet louise
i always found it hard to work things through
those school uniforms made a joke
made a joke of me and you
i'm glad i'm not back in school
she got an older boyfriend ( how could she ? )
had a beard
smoked marlboro red
how can i compete with that ? ( how can he ? )
i don't even know the location of the bike sheds
oh sweet louise
i always found it hard to work things through
those school uniforms made a joke
made a joke of me and you
i always found it hard to work things through
those school uniforms made a joke
made a joke of me and you
i remember short skirts
long hair
my hormones flying everywhere
i always found it hard to work things through
those school uniforms made a joke
made a joke of me and you
i always found it hard to work things through
those school uniforms made a joke
made a joke of me and you
i'm glad i'm not back in school
