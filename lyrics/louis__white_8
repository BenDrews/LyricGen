oh louie , whatever happened to us ?
we used to be so close
but now i run away when you're near
you make my heart so sore
just a beat hurts when you're here
you went cold , i was told
so i froze , and now i'll never see you again !
oh louie , whatever happened to us ?
just saying your name hurts
i think you'd agree
we were two peas in a pod
but now the pod has been ripped from the pea
you went cold , i was told
so i froze , and now i'll never see you again !
oh louie , whatever happened to us ?
oh louie , whatever happened to us ? ( 6x )
oh louie...
