luminous mind , bright devil
of absolute clusterings , of upright noon - - - :
here we are at last , alone , without loneliness ,
far from the savage city's delirium.
just as a pure line describes the dove's curve ,
as the fire honors and nourishes peace ,
so you and i made this heavenly outcome.
the mind and love live naked in this house.
furious dreams , rivers of bitter certainty ,
decisions harder than the dreams of a hammer
flowed into the lovers' double cup ,
until those twins were lifted into balance
on the scale : the mind and love , like two wings.
- - - so this transparency was built.
