i woke up , poundin’ head
with a bottle , layin’ in the bed
there was a little , a little bit left
so i picked it up , and i killed the rest
oh i know i’m going to heaven
but i can’t go with me like this
i need to pull myself together before then
no , and i ain’t afraid of dyin’
but what scares me to death
is meetin’ jesus with whiskey on my breath
i lost her and all my friends
broke all but one of my lord’s ten
but jesus died for all my sins
that’s how i know i’m gettin’ in
