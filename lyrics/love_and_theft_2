she likes whiskey with her water
she starts dancing when the stars come out
she ain’t your typical preacher’s daughter
she’ll leave you dreamin’ yeah there ain’t no doubt
there’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
she’s a little bit of heaven with a wild side
got a rebel heart a country mile wide
there’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
saturday night she’s rockin’ out by the bonfire
flirting from that tail gate and crankin’ up the dial
come sunday mornin’ she’ll be singing with the choir
drivin’ me crazy with that kiss me smile
there’s a little bit of devil in those angel eyes
she’s a little bit of heaven with a wild side
got a rebel heart a country mile wide
there’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
there’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
and i can’t stop wonderin’ what it would feel like , to hold her all night
she’s got that something , that sexy innocence , she must be heaven sent
there’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
she’s a little bit of heaven with a wild side
got a rebel heart a country mile wide
there’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
there’s a little bit of devil in those angel eyes
she’s a little bit of heaven with a wild side
got a rebel heart a country mile wide
there’s a little bit of devil in her angel eyes
there’s a little bit of devil in her
in those angel , in those angel eyes
