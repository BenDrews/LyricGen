downtown , big city , busy streets
small town , front porch swing
sunset on a boulevard
last call at a tiki bar
middle of the night , morning light
pulling you in on these lips of mine
anytime , anywhere
let the world stop and stare
on a jet plane , fast train
anyplace baby , i don’t care
what you want and when you need it
i don’t even really need a reason
i’ll go there
and i’ll kiss you , kiss you
baby , anytime anywhere
baby , anytime anywhere
the back of your neck on a moonlit levee
in the bed of my beat up chevy
slow dancing just off the blacktop
fireflies falling like electric raindrops
sunday drive , friday night
baby , right now would be just fine

a covered bridge on a country road
rollin’ in the sand down in mexico
from the red on your lips to the red on your toes
