you got a glass , i got a tab
you’re lookin’ good , i got it bad
come on girl , tell me what you’re drinkin’
you got a smile , makin’ me wonder
if i take a chance , how ‘bout another
one of them winks to tell me what you’re thinkin’
cause we got a good buzz
we’re feelin’ all high
we got our hands , tangled up in a dance
we’re feelin’ alright
we got the whole night , to keep getting closer
we got tomorrow , tomorrow to hang out hungover
you got a way of owning the room
and you’ve got a glow that outshines the moon
and you got me quiet , whisperin’ in my ear
i got a song , i’ll think it up
and i got a move , you’re gonna love
and i got a place when you wanna get out of here
we keep lookin’ at the door
so what are we both waitin’ for
you got a glass , i got a tab
you’re lookin’ good , i got it bad
