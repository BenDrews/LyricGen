everybody’s called their ex
feelin’ alone at three a.m
and everybody’s spent money they don’t got
to try and look like someone they’re really not
and everybody’s cheated someone they love
and everybody drives drunk
everybody’s been in the place
where you keep fightin’ and fightin’
but you can’t find your way
and everybody’s felt so alone
like they’ll never find someone
they can call their own
and everybody’s addicted to their own kinda drug
and everybody drives drunk
fell off into the deep end
lied right to their best friend
said i love you when they didn’t even mean it
everybody’s holdin’ onto somethin’ they’ve lost
no rhyme or reason i just guess it’s because
everybody’s got something rushin’ through their blood
and everybody , everybody drives drunk
everybody’s called their ex
feelin’ alone at three a.m
