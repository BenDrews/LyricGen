eleven a.m. lyin’ in bed
thinkin’ bout you and lit a cigarette
if i could bribe the sun and make it go down
i wouldn’t have to wait for tonight to come around
seein’ your eyes , feelin’ the rush
like a shot of good whiskey runnin’ through my blood
put your lips on my smile
let ‘em stay for a while
can you feel it , like i feel it
slip on out of that shirt
you’re lookin’ so good it hurts
can you feel it , like i feel it
you're makin’ my heart go
ohh ohh ohh
you’re makin’ my heart go
ohh ohh ohh
throw a blanket down on the hood of my car
get a twelve pack in and take it too far
forget about the world it’s all about you
i wanna turn you on , tell me what to do
seein’ your eyes , feelin’ the rush
the sweat on your skin is getting me drunk
