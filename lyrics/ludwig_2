oh friends , not these tones !
rather , let us raise our voices in more pleasing
and more joyful sounds !
joy ! ( joy ! )
joy ! ( joy ! )
joy , beautiful spark of divinity
daughter of elysium
we enter , drunk with fire
into your sanctuary , heavenly ( daughter ) !
your magic reunites
what custom strictly divided
all men become brothers
where your gentle wing rests
whoever has had the great fortune
to be a friend's friend
whoever has won a devoted wife
join in our jubilation !
indeed , whoever can call even one soul
his own on this earth !
and whoever was never able to , must creep
tearfully away from this band !
joy all creatures drink
at the breasts of nature ;
all good , all bad
follow her trail of roses
kisses she gave us , and wine
a friend , proved in death ;
pleasure was given to the worm
and the cherub stands before god
before god !
glad , as his suns fly
through the heaven's glorious design
run , brothers , your path
joyful , as a hero to victory
be embraced , millions !
this kiss for the whole world !
brothers , above the starry canopy
must a loving father dwell
do you bow down , millions ?
do you sense the creator , world ?
seek him beyond the starry canopy !
beyond the stars must he dwell
be embraced , you millions !
this kiss for the whole world !
brothers , beyond the star - canopy
must a loving father dwell
be embraced
this kiss for the whole world !
joy , beautiful spark of divinity
daughter of elysium
joy , beautiful spark of divinity
divinity !
