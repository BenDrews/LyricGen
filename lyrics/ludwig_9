oh you men who think or say that i am malevolent , stubborn ,
or misanthropic , how greatly do you wrong me....
the heiligenstadt testament
three miles from my adopted city
lies a village where i came to peace.
the world there was a calm place ,
even the great danube no more
than a pale ribbon tossed onto the landscape
by a girl's careless hand. into this stillness
i had been ordered to recover.
the hills were gold with late summer ;
my rooms were two , plus a small kitchen ,
situated upstairs in the back of a cottage
at the end of the herrengasse.
from my window i could see onto the courtyard
where a linden tree twined skyward —
leafy umbilicus canted toward light ,
warped in the very act of yearning —
and i would feed on the sun as if that alone
would dismantle the silence around me.
at first i raged. then music raged in me ,
rising so swiftly i could not write quickly enough
to ease the roiling. i would stop
to light a lamp , and whatever i'd missed —
larks flying to nest , church bells , the shepherd's
home - toward - evening song — rushed in , and i
would rage again.
i am by nature a conflagration ;
i would rather leap
than sit and be looked at.
so when my proud city spread
her gypsy skirts , i reentered ,
burning towards her greater , constant light.
call me rough , ill - tempered , slovenly— i tell you ,
every tenderness i have ever known
has been nothing
but thwarted violence , an ache
so permanent and deep , the lightest touch
awakens it. . . . it is impossible
to care enough. i have returned
with a second symphony
and 15 piano variations
which i've named prometheus ,
after the rogue titan , the half - a - god
who knew the worst sin is to take
what cannot be given back.
i smile and bow , and the world is loud.
and though i dare not lean in to shout
can't you see that i'm deaf ? —
i also cannot stop listening.
