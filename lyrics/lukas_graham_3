when it's my time , i know you'll tailor a new suit for me
and buy a new tie , so i'll look this good
boy , you were right
you said only them good ones die young
never in my life did i look this good
everyone welcome to my funeral
everyone i know better be wasted
you know i would pour one up
cause the way i lived , it was amazing
all of my friends are in the room
party for me - i'd party too
you're all on my tab
bartenders pour out the whiskeys on me
and don't be so sad
cause i lived this good
we were closer
now it's over
but it doesn't mean it's closure
i see you and i love you
i'll be watching out above you
everyone welcome to my funeral
everyone i know better be wasted
you know i would pour one up
cause the way i lived , it was amazing
all of my friends are in the room
party for me - i'd party too
all of my friends are in the room
party for me - i'd party too
everyone welcome to my funeral
everyone i know better be wasted
you know i would pour one up
cause the way i lived , it was amazing
welcome to my funeral
everyone i know better be wasted
you know i would pour one up
cause the way i lived , it was amazing
welcome to my funeral
everyone i know better be wasted
you know i would pour one up
cause the way i lived , it was amazing
so welcome to my funeral
welcome to my funeral
