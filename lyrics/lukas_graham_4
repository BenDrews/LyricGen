i've always dreamt of travel
why should we die where we were born ? ( born )
some road are laid with gravel
sometimes you gotta build your own ( own )
i wanna tear down boundaries
i wanna greet my enemies
i wanna see what i haven't seen
cause i know there's more
i take the world by storm ( storm , storm , storm )
i take the world by storm ( storm , storm , storm )
i don't have any answers
the more know the more i grow ( grow )
i don't know where i'm going
but i'mma search cause i see hope ( hope )
i wanna tear down boundaries
i wanna greet my enemies
i wanna see what i haven't seen
cause i know there's more
i take the world by storm ( storm , storm , storm )
i take the world by storm ( storm , storm , storm )
there's got to be more than this
gotta figure out how to jump the wall
i wanna live and learn
don't matter if i land or if i fall
i know i might return
at least i know i'll be walking tall
i'm not afraid
cause i take the world by storm ( storm , storm , storm )
i take the world by storm ( storm , storm , storm )
