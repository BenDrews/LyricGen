once i was seven years old
my father told me , i'll never leave again
you won't be lonely
once i was seven years old
i was a kid , i was seven
never knew you or knew where you would be
what was the pen , too innocent ?
nothing you said was making any sense
i was like damn , who is this man ?
standing before me saying take a chance
suddenly everything i thought i knew about the world
was taken when i shook his hand
i was so mad , didn't know why
why was my name all tatted on your side ?
why did you mess with the bliss over me and my sister
we're cool without you , doin' fine
we came around , you came around
told us you would never ever leave
heart on my sleeve , letting it bleed
waiting for you again , cause i believe
once i was eleven years old
my momma told me
i won't do this again , need you to go please
once i was eleven years old
i wasn't there , i didn't care
moving around a lot and couldn't bare
everyone wanted to fix it and took me away
from my sister to live on a prayer
breaking the law , getting expelled
didn't believe in nothing , you could tell
wanted to fail , gunnin' for jail
wanted to kill my father in a cell
i was a mess , that i confess
too young to bottle this up in my chest
too young to do what i was doing
who knew that i would've been a little bit depressed
got into blow , got into dope
made an investment with nothing to show
it was the only thing i had control over
and it was all over whenever it go
once i was twenty years old
my father wrote me
son , i'm sorry that you never got to know me
once i was twenty years old
i didn't know then , and i don't know know
why it was hard for me to write it down
why it was easier to say out loud
and whenever i try to write i feel a cloud
sooner or later i gave it up
one way or another , can't say enough
when i met my brother and told him
i wanted to hear from you , that was a major bluff
i was right in the middle of using , abusing and losing myself
i knew not of sobriety
i wasn't ready to meet him
i didn't feel like i could be a role model entirely
but inside of me i was like , damn i relate
and i thought i could be of some help
and it didn't dawn on me
i couldn't be somebody's light if i don't love myself
but soon i'll be sixty years old
and will i still hold on
to everything that happened and be so cold ?
soon i'll be sixty years old
soon i'll be sixty years old
