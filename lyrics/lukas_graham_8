i got the letter back
saying i can come and see you
i really don't have time
but promised that i'd come and see you
you're sitting far away
but do you know i sometimes need you
i know that you deserve
the time you got of all the people
i know you never bent
even in the strongest wind
i really wished to every god
that you were innocent
i'm happy and i'm proud
that i can still call you my friend
i hope you read the letters
and the magazines i send
you got your head up
but i don't have my hopes high
i know that you’re a good man
and that's what , brings a tear to my eye
i'm like , oh
i hope you know you're not alone in that hell
and there ain't , no
no one can change it
no one can do it better than yourself
i was sixteen
and we used to roll together
you told me back then
that i was meant for something better
you know in our life
nothing's gonna change but the weather
it seems it's been forever
since we really stuck together
i'm living a crazy life
i wish that you could see it too
see a thousand people sing
my song from me to you
every time i sing it
you know i'm bleeding too
man i accept you as you are
no i don't need the truth
i got my head up
but i ain’t got my hopes high
see i know that you’re a good man
and it brings a tear to my eye
i'm like , oh...
i hope you know you're not alone in that hell
and there ain't , no
no one can change it
no one can do it better than yourself
i reminisce to back then , when it was you and i
smoking big fat blunts , drive in movie night
they tried to get you down , but you refused to die
they tried to give you angel wings , but you refused to fly
you'd rather stay in hell , and take your time in jail
they're only punishing a soul that you will never sell
we both know that we owe nothing to each other
but can you blame me , for loving and missing my brother
i hope you know you're not alone in that hell
and there ain't , no
no one can change it
no one can do it better than yourself
i hope you know you're not alone in that hell
and there ain't , no
no one can change it
no one can do it better than yourself
