years gone by and i miss you
i can't describe what you been through
but you’re gone
we do what we believe in
set a goal and stop dreaming
i'm not saying you’re wrong
but every time you’re going in
i'm asking myself why
hoping oh just hoping you won't go , ho , oh , oh
i know you’re proud of me
you’re holding your head high
it's ok , it's ok , it's ok , it's ok
‘cause i know i'll get you back
though i know your mind is criminal
it don't matter no , that you’re going in again
i know i'll get you back
though i know your mind is criminal
i got women for you man when you’re coming out again
you know i could have been with you
been with you done what you been through
i had a chance to choose
when enough's enough will you know it
when you reach your goal will you hold it
i'm afraid you’re gonna lose
but every time you’re going in
i'm asking myself why
hoping oh just hoping you won't go , ho , oh , oh
i know you’re proud of me
you’re holding your head high
it's ok , it's ok , it's ok , it's ok
‘cause i know i'll get you back
though i know your mind is criminal
it don't matter no , that you’re going in again
i know i'll get you back
though i know your mind is criminal
i got women for you man when you’re coming out again
i know i'll get you back , a criminal , a criminal
i know i'll get you back , a criminal , a criminal
i know i'll get you back , a criminal , a criminal
i know i'll get you back , a criminal , a criminal
