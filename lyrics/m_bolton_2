little boy , tries to hide
from the fire in his backyard
burning cross , white cloth
it's the second time this year
hitler's brothers are still alive
they're wearing everyday disguises
a woman runs , for asylum
she's the only one of her kind in this neighborhood
she knows who they were
they don't believe a word
the cops just turn their heads to protect their friends
hitler's brothers are still alive
their army seems to grow in size
hitler's brothers are on the rise
they're wearing everyday disguises
...in camouflage or business suits
another man , bound and gagged
tied upon the railroad tracks
at nine p.m. the b&m ( boston & maine )
rolled across his yellow skin
hitler's brothers are still alive
their army seems to grow in size
hitler's brothers are on the rise
they're wearing everyday disguises
in camouflage or business suits
checkered aprons , combat boots
time to let those feelings go
hatred only kills your souls
