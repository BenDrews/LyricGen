dear mr. wenner ,
your august 3 cover rewards a terrorist with celebrity treatment. it is ill - conceived , at best , and re - affirms a terrible message that destruction gains fame for killers and their ’causes.’ there may be valuable journalism behind your sensational treatment , though we can’t know because almost all you released is the cover.
to respond to you in anger is to feed into your obvious marketing strategy. so , i write to you instead to put the focus where you could have : on the brave and strong survivors and on the thousands of people – their family and friends , volunteers , first responders , doctors , nurses and donors – who have come to their side. among those we lost , those who survived , and those who help carry them forward , there are artists and musicians and dancers and writers. they have dreams and plans. they struggle and strive. the survivors of the boston attacks deserve rolling stone cover stories , though i no longer feel that rolling stone deserves them.
sincerely ,
thomas m. menino
mayor of boston
