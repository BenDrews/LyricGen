some people , oh , whoa , oh - oh...
yeah , people say , people , oh - oh , say...
people love you when they on your mind
a thought is love's currency
and i been thinking 'bout her all the time
i've never seen somebody put together perfectly
what do i have to do to call you mine ?
someone like you is so hard to find
you can open up your eyes , or you can walk it blind
all i ask is that you hurry , i won't hurt you , don't you worry
listen to me , i'ma set you free
he ain't gonna break your heart again
go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
when your imagination's on pretend
i never thought that it would feel this way
you never taught me how to heal the pain
i wish you caught me on a different day
when it was easier to be happy
just a little taste and you know she got you
can you hide away ? can you hide away ?
sound of silence as they all just watch you
i kinda find it strange , how the times have changed
i wish we could go and be free once , baby , you and me
we could change the world forever
and never come back again
let's leave it all in the rear view
let's leave it all in the rear view
you don't have to cry , you don't have to cry
mend a broken heart , girl , if you can
i don't expect you to be capable
you got the world right in your hands
and that responsibility is unescapable
i promise that i'll be a different man
please give me the chance to go and live again
i'm having some trouble , can you give a hand ?
it seems perfection really is so unattainable
don't even say you 'bout to end it all
your life precious , ain't no need to go and kill yourself
i'm not so sure that there's an end at all
i wish the truth would just reveal itself
who do you call to make it to the top ?
and who do you call to make the shooting stop ?
and who do you call to give the coupe a wash ?
after everything i did , i think i'm still myself
just a little taste and you know she got you
can you hide away ? can you hide away ?
sound of silence as they all just watch you
i kinda find it strange , how the times have changed
i wish we could go and be free once , baby , you and me
we could change the world forever
and never come back again
let's leave it all in the rear view
let's leave it all in the rear view
you don't have to cry , you don't have to cry
