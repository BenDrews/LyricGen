uh uh
close my eyes before i cross the street
if a car about to hit me , then he ought to beep
watching dawson's creek 'til i fall asleep
it's harder than it seems , i'm under water in my dreams
i'm in awe , this jigsaw , puzzles not complete
i'm just an idea , nothing concrete
came to raise limits , get higher than plane engines
they tryna change with us , but come to the same difference
shut your pie - hole , i'm dope and i know
my voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
i don't mind those hating on my style
i tend to take the high road , get stoned and fly low
i'm no god , i don't think that i'm a human , though cause i'm so odd
people selling drugs cause they can't find no job
wonder if christ made a million off selling the cross
let bygones be bygones , my mind strong as pythons
the day that i die on will turn me to an icon
search the world for zion or a shoulder i can cry on
the best of all time , i'm dylan , dylan , dylan , dylan , ( dylan )

it ain't no party like aristocratic parties
yeah , yo , yo , yo , oh
said , ain't no party like aristocratic parties
yeah , yo
sipping jameson like i was majored in whiskey flavouring
when i'm drunk , i'll cut your head off and leave it dangling
flylo's still tryna put me on to ableton
asian women love me , i look like david duchovny
in kindergarten , used to put some condoms in my cubby
in case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
i ain't nobody , and neither are you
been contemplating if i even still believe in the truth
i'm so stubborn , i'd rather write my own history book
where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
all your songs are sixteen's and a hook
we're here to reinvent music , it's time for the revolution
i'm dying for the movement , trying not to lose it
jewish buddhist consuming the views of christianity
wonder if hindus like to eat fish soup
if it's true , they should hit alaska in a igloo
i hear the fish biting nice right now
i can't figure out life and feel right right now
boo , if i think it , i should say it , there's a reason that i write it down
spit the shit that leave a diaper brown , poo
somebody do something ( somebody do something )
