yeah , light up 'til the pain gone , all i hear is the same song
when the radio came on , fuck around and get based on
do this shit 'til the day i die , are you ready , are you ready ?
terrified but my hand is steady , verified , get the camera ready
carry my own weight , all these earthquakes don't wake
me up from this deep sleep , diving into this cold lake
fuck a bitch til her toes shake , telling me i'm her soul - mate
disguised emotion , no face , bullshit with that , no thanks
dealing with it since '08 , fucked around , now i'm done
and i heard you're supposed to race
when you hear the sound of that gun
now it's losing all of its fun , spending days in solitude
too many dumb interviews , put me in this awful mood
not thinking logical , getting high , jump off the moon
looked into his soul , when he died right there in the hospital
peace don't seem possible , when the mind is so closed
came in for your money , then left with all of your hoes
life move fast but my baby keep it slow
open up your mind start forgetting what you know
shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone
you hurt so good , girl your loving hurt so good
love me , love me , that fentanyl it numb me
beautiful it get ugly , turn you into a junkie
still searching for something , but i don't know what
dreaming about nothing , wake you up and then fuck
i love it when you get a little nasty
hit it from the back , if you like that , wiggle them ass cheeks
isn't that sweet , same shit we did last week
'fore all the cash , you might stood up and would've walked passed me
wake me up from this bad dream , put a match to this gasoline
every night you somebody different , got me thinking it's halloween
fucked up , i can't feel myself , work hard might kill myself
exist through audio , but all my problems that's real as hell
trapped in this wishing well , death creeping like splinter cell
getting high , blew my mind away
find the words to what i'm tryna say
...i'mma think of that later
when the world goes against you , better get that paper
life move fast but my baby keep it slow
open up your mind start forgetting what you know
shit ain't been the same since you left me here alone
you hurt so good , girl your loving hurt so good
you hurt so good
you hurt so good
