think i can see a fucking halo , about to meet my maker
brought a double cup of drano , some soda for the flavor
uncontrollable behavior with some psychopathic tendencies
lonely as your neighbors with the bitches
he got special needs
word to my denim fiends , i'm kennedy on ecstasy
my flavor from the nature , need an acre for my recipe
they got my soul , but i don't let 'em take the rest of me
my melody , a little like kenny g's , it's heavenly
and my denim tailored , me and action rapping
al be fucking with the fader , sipping mind eraser
actually , we rapping for the fuck of it
taking money from you , gonna smack you out in public
we the republican government , abundance of substance
having consumption to fuck a bitch
you're banana republic fit , go suck a dick !
and your bitch looking like cousin itt , the ugliest
i said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
groupie bitches wild enough to suck a baby's dick
cadillacs is getting whipped a hundred eighty fifth
just for that sizzle , gore - tex in case of drizzle
i said it must be the drugs that got us thinking crazy shit
looking up into the clouds where the angels sit
they looking down , keeping watch 'til i'm dead
so how'd i get this red dot on my head ?
yo , i don't perform unless the money's in my pocket first
after rapping take my people out for octopus
we all deserve it ; dedication to the fam
don't hold your hand out for nothing
if you claim to be my man , damn
you see me peeling off a whip like when your mother strip
blow the dice , roll them chips , hit another trip
shit , i'm on some shit
hand's fucking hotter than a leather in the 6 in the summertime
understand i'm only rhyming for this son of mine
and so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils
we ate the tuna , it's suede puma
my look is jay buhner , dawggy
‘cause some of us just age sooner
i'm still twisted , rocking lizards from a strange river
forbidden jungle in the joint paper , point shaver
check the bio , i fixed the game
between kentucky and miami of ohio , i been wild
bitch i'm nodding off , i'm hot as wasabi sauce
and constantly giving y'all a bit of this ambiance
i was a minor , chasing after vagina
none of my friends were fake , but none of my clothes designer
went from posted on stoops to smoking on roofs
i came from that basement , now look at this view
making this money , blowing it all
fuck what you did , just show me results
yo , i'm a 635 dipper , fly mothafucka
leather to the foot , horses , i lead 'em to the brook
if you locked , then keep the chisel in the book
i see a lion in the mirror when i look
look , i lose money , but i make it back
i keep it true and ain't no mothafuckin' faking that
i get a fade and then i fade to black
bet on the razorbacks
i hold the multi - colored flavored gat – blat !
i said it must be the drugs , i said it must be the drugs
i said it must be the drugs , i said it must be the drugs
i said it must be the drugs , i said it must be the drugs
i said it must be the drugs , i said it must be the drugs
you was easy mac with the cheesy raps
who the fuck is mac miller ?
this name says " crack dealing trap nigga slash cap peeler
back with a black stripper
ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker , too fat to snap zippers "
in half is what i'll do to mac miller
now my mind's first track figured
a nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir , taps liquor
then pass 'til it goes around the room , like his casket finna
oh , you mac miller ?
the fact's filtered in the snapped picture
my man jack ripped over google like jack the ripper
you who i'm finna murder , this brunette bitch
get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
a rap figure that look like you hacked twitter
i'll show you , beastie boy
you can't match your killer with that wigger
i'd rather attack tigger or jack thriller
he got track fillers for a album
if he had jigga on an ad - sticker
wouldn't go cat litter where i'm from , malcolm
i knock the thoughts off your balcony , king
you're from a home of funny bones
not like quite the one i've known
you look like , before you punched in flows
you were strucking blows , bloody nose for your honey rolls
in the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
you're a bully's best day ever with them nike's on your feet
coming through blue slide park
i'm gon' rob this chump
on a party on fifth ave like he donald trump
nigga , give me that shit !
i liked you better when you was easy mac with the cheesy raps – who the fuck is mac miller ?
