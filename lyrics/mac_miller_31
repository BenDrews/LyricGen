good evening everybody
how's everybody doing ?
just wanna ask a question , um , have you , have you
have you been in love , before ?
you like your vodka with a little touch of lime
you should probably take your heels off
cause you've been running through my mind
oh baby , they say we're no good for each other
and i can't really tell , what is this spell you put me under
your love's not too kind to me
i hate the pain these days of rain
you're playing games of hide and seek , my love
and i'm still trying to find you , i'm looking for you babe
and i'm still trying to find you , through sunshine or rain
( i love you )
yeah , you got your stained glass iris
diamond behind your eyelids , autopilot fly
my heart skipped a beat like a scratched cd
your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi
let's take a plane to fiji , make a date , let's take it easy
love is power
swear there's something about her that make me nervous
mother earth done gave us all a gift , she made you perfect
let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus
girl you know i'm loving you just like you deserve it
so baby make me earn it , show me the way you work it
tell me what you afraid of , i'll spit you my favorite verses
let's just go take a breath
i want it all , every ounce of love that you got left
you are my drug and love to death
feel free to fall , you are a catch
i'm in your heart , i'm in your dream
so fuck the world , it's you and me
she is the only one that got away
if love don't last forever then forever ain't the same , yeah
your love is not too kind , to me , yeah
you know my love is sugar sweet , yeah
the only thing on my mind , is she
you think about you , i've been thinking of me
my love , my love
my love , my love , yeah
and i know that nothing lasts forever
nothing lasts forever
yeah , and she is cool , calm and collected
i knew that you was the one
when i seen you leave me breathless
say okay i need a second day today , give me attention
i want to take care of you
marry you , something i'm prepared to do , there can't be two
you was here , i ran from you , scared to take that step
but now that i am ready , you're not , you up and left me
hope your new man make you laugh like i do
i do not mean to worry you with my obsession
i just want to be beside you
i'm too nice , and i had to pay that price
everything i do is wrong , everything you do is right
let's start a family , hold on to forever baby
your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy
