i never take a day off
work around the clock , my engineer gettin' paid off
rock like aesop , light the weed and take off
so high i cannot see , adolf
now i got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
cause every time i get up on the mic , it come correct
and i learned it from the best , always dressed in somethin' fresh
lookin' for a little dime , big butt and nice chest
yes , they heard i used to rock guess
but now i'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
travel back in time , i'm in a vortex
tryna to make it work out , think i need more reps
used to take a bus , now the boy board jets
cause k.i.d.s. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
they say i got next , tell them that i got now
it's all disney boy , my family proud
make 'em say " ow " , make 'em say " oh "
the hoes that tell me " yes " , the same ones that tell you " no "
woah , i ain't just an average joe , way above the average flow
boy , my life is most dope
no matter where life takes me , find me with a smile
pursuit to be happy , only laughing like a child
i never thought life would be this sweet
it got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
and i ain't going to wait for nothing
cause that just ain't my style
life couldn't get better
this 'gon be the best day ever
if it ain't about a dream , then it ain't about me
go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
imagination , makin' , musical creation
the journey that i'm facin' plus the paper that i'm chasin'
got me crazy , half insane and with the lames i see you hatin'
but there's nothing' that you're changin' , thumbs up , i'm maintainin'
no complainin' when it's rainin'
i'll be in another zone , move out my mother's home to a world i call my own
i ain't gonna play around no more
found a difference from the ground and the floor
if we got a fight , i'll be down for the war
thumbs up , homie i'll be sure
no matter where life takes me , find me with a smile
pursuit to be happy , only laughing like a child
i never thought life would be this sweet
it got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek
and i ain't going to wait for nothing
cause that just ain't my style
life couldn't get better
this 'gon be the best day ever
