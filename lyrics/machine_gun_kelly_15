but if you can't take me at my worst
you don't deserve me at my best

got to keep it goin' , got to keep my head up , uh
i got to keep it goin' , got to keep my head up

ladies and gentlemen , here's the exhibit
it's my life , look a little closer , you could see the highlight
gold ain't always golden but i told 'em
look at all the years i've been waitin' for a moment
shed a lot of tears just to smile in the mornin'
tell me could you love me ? tell me could you love me ?
tell me could you love me if i told you why ?
