all my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
all my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
one time
all my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
all my dreamer's put your hands in the sky
one time
for the bullshit that you came from
worked hard to get away from
but the devils there and you just can't seem to shake em
two times
for them long nights that you stayed up
thinkin about that paper
crush it , lick it , split it , light it , blaze up
from the mind of a stoner , from the mind of a stoner
simple thoughts from a loner , simple thoughts from a loner
just the mind of a stoner , the mind of a stoner
simpler thoughts from a loner , simple thoughts from a loner , oh
parents aren't doin much now since little brother got locked up
and i’m stuck smokin this mid waiting for the weed man to get stocked up
and my girl cancelled on me , said something else popped up
and i can't get with my ex now cuz her ring finger all rocked up , damn
no one likes you when your 23 without a plan
sit around in apartments all day smokin weed and i’m like
" bitch don't kill my vibe , bitch don't kill my vibe "
till i ( skkrrrrrrttt ) out in my subaru and in the rear view is them lights
i'm talking about red white and blue
the same color as our flag
the one's that they say salute
but the ones that's whoopin my ass
and the same days that i’m happy
is the same days that i’m mad
cuz i can't go 24 hours without shit happening to my ass , get high
rollin up this weed
thinkin about life
and you know what ?
i'm good , yeah !
