oh , these times are hard
yeah , they're making us crazy
don't give up on me , baby
i'm just out here chasing my dreams , girl
but it's crazy cause that dream cost me my dream girl
promised you i wouldn't change before i left
now i think leaving is the one thing i regret
cause the one thing i possess
it wasn't materials , wasn't checks , wasn't cars , wasn't clothes , or any part of success
it was you , and without that in my life i'm depressed
you became the new drug i couldn't get
and every time you came over i was on some shit
either too fucked up , or bitching about how you dress
even though i remember when you would lay with me when i ain't have a bed
buy me food and come wake me up with some head
you had me like a dread - locked down , but i wouldn't show it
instead got on that bus and left you blowing in the wind
shit , and it's fucked up cause every girl i'm with i see your face
now summers here and i'm sitting outside your place singing this shit
i never thought for a minute if you showed me a picture of my life now , that you wouldn't be in it
took me a couple years to say i loved you , but i meant it when i said it
wasn't much of a romantic , but you get it
didn't really smoke , but when i rolled it up , you hit it
and we lit it up - shotgunning our kisses
and fuck these other bitches , baby , fuck these other bitches in my bunk
staring up at all your pictures that you sent me on my birthday
remember that ? cause i couldn't forget it
like i forgot yours , but i'm sorry and i said it
i admit it , i fucked up and i lied , but this is true
i don't know what home is because i'm lost without you
just like our favorite song , yeah - blink 182
now i just turn it off when it comes on , i wish i hated you
i used to have someone at 3am that i could call
now it just rings and i don't get nothing at all
where you at girl ?

yeah hold on give me a minute
{ " your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system " }
