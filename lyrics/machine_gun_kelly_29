i know you've been gone , gone , gone
i know you've been gone , gone , gone
i know you've been gone , gone , gone
but are you missing me ?
i know you're missing me
looking down at my phone , see another missed call
i'm pissed off , i never had these problems back when i was piss poor
scared to see my daughter now because i'm lost in the life
in the bathroom getting high when she called twice
sorry , but i'm scared to look at something so precious when i'm a mess
and her mother know it , i wonder if she ever regrets
tryna convince my family that i'm only gone for these checks
when really i'm obsessed with getting my revenge through success
cause people hated on me , how could i not show 'em ?
fans waited on me , damn , how do i not owe 'em ?
imagine having to make that decision
while baby girl's in the kitchen , tears dripping
wondering where her pop's going
but i never meant to make you unhappy , can i see that smile ?
phone's ringing... " aye , yo , i'm with my child "
anyways , i wanna write you a symphony
but instead she said all i ever wanted is you to stay a while , damn
i know you've been gone , gone , gone
i know you've been gone , gone , gone
i know you've been gone , gone , gone
but are you missing me ?
i know you're missing me
and hey , hey , hey
it's been so long so you've gone away
five years to be more specific
i was out here trying to sign to atlantic
you crossed the pacific
now is it a coincidence that my first instrument was a violin
that my father wanted for me , so we ended up buying
and now the instrumental that we're vibing to got one high in it
and while i'm writing my first verse he called me up crying ?
that shit is crazy , half a decade with no explanation
now you're asking if it's too late to save us
man , i don't know so i hang up without saying nothing , just click end
wasn't man enough to say it so i wrote with a pen
i just wanted to make you happy , but you never smiled
i just wanted that phone call that said your daddy's proud
anyways , maybe eventually we'll relive memories
and you'll be next to me and both of us can stay a while , yeah
i know you've been gone , gone , gone
i know you've been gone , gone , gone
i know you've been gone , gone , gone
but are you missing me ?
i know you're missing me
and hey , hey , hey
it's been so long so you've gone away
one day i'll be gone
one day , one day , one day , one day i'll be gone
( but are you missing me ? )
one day , one day , one day , one day i'll be gone
( but are you missing me ? )
one day , one day , one day , one day i'll be gone
( but are you missing me ? )
one day , one day , one day , one day i'll be gone
( but are you missing me ? )
