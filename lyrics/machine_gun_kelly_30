they told me to write a soundtrack
for the kids who ain't have shit
no problem , flashback me 2006
broke as piss , scraping bus fare up
dolla fifty cents , get out of school and go to work
matter fact fuck all this i quit
i got a dream that we gon change the world soon
and one day get the fuck outta this bedroom
maybe write a song for the girl who cries when she thinks of her past
but just press play , i tell her smile and then she laughs , look at that , yeah
music makes the world go round
and the ones in search of freedom generates into a crowd
all it takes is one believer with a voice to introduce us to what’s real
and since my throat is clear i guess that’s why i’m here
*clears throat* chyeah
see my teachers told me go away to college
but what they don’t tell you is ain't no guarantees if you’re a scholar
even with 18 degrees , you could be jobless with uncle sam in your pockets
so i said fuck my doctrines
rapped and made more money than these doctors
now one day ill be too fly driving three girls in my four door while these five j's make a fellowship of smoke rings bitch i’m frodo lost it all this year but bounced back like a pogo , kells ,
and we just watch the sun turn into the moon
sit back and hope that these december nights turn into june
see it started as a dream , that dream came true
send a message to my city tell them we'll be home soon , home soon
x2
and i’m like what we waiting round for
found something to celebrate now we on round four
ground floor was the past now the sky is the limit penthouse edition
exhibit a : a bunch of young muhfuckas livin
i used to hustle to get it
used up all of my minutes
in hopes of one of my ex's telling me she owned a business and heard bout my situation here’s a check for a million
but this is reality and charity don’t go to sinners
but clarity comes in pinners of marijuana and splinters
an absentee in attendance at all my high school events
i just wasn’t fond of attention when all i had was resentment
i started out as a freshman and graduated a henchman
i worked my way up to jimmy
worked my way up the totem
and those who hated on me was just adding weight to my scrotum
see life is a poker game i got the hand now i ain't folding
i’m king midas touch my future with this hand now that shits golden , whoo
one day ill be too fly whippin three girls in my four door while these five j's make a fellowship of smoke rings bitch i’m frodo lost it all this year but bounced back like a pogo , man i swear to god
