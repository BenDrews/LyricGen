uh , this ain't no halo over my head , bitch
but dear god , can you forgive the sinning
for everything i done did since my beginning
because the devil around me so much that you would think i got a death wish ?
yeah , and the voices in my head get louder
watching my career disappear like powder ( poof )
wish i could rewind those hours and get my life back ( back )
strike that , clinging to this weed like a life jacket ( yeah )
fuck rapping , i was really living everything that i was spitting , bitch
what's happening ? ( wassup )
fights daily , nights crazy , dream chasing till the drugs came in
i was chopping up them bitches like jason
had a muthafucker's face laying on the cold pavement ( uh )
wake up , take 'em , now i feel sane ( whoop )
spending every penny in the studio slaving ( yeah )
me and my mob working any odd job
praying that this little dream was gonna feed our babies
save me lord , save me lord , what the fuck is this curse you gave me lord ?
everybody think i finally made it lord , but all i am now is a slave , my god
and revelation says
" he will wipe every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more
neither shall there be mourning , nor crying , nor pain anymore
for the former things have passed away "
est for life , muthafucker !
ughk , put that halo around my neck , bitch ( bitch )
and gimmie death
i'm twenty - two and this twenty - two on my left , god bless
maybe i'll finally sleep
maybe they'll return what's originally mine , cause finder's keep
maybe i will be great , and this voice of mine was designed to be the finest key
but , i'm losing faith ( ok )
everyday they got news to break
like my single flopped , and now i ain't hot
and they don't know if imma ever gonna see the light of day
it's " my labels mad " or " my albums bad " or " you ain't living up to the hype we thought you had "
or i lost a fan , or i'm in cuffs again
yeah , meanwhile i ain't there to be my daughter's dad
fuck what's meant for me , because i don't ever wanna become a celebrity
i don't ever want someone to feel less than me
so put your camera down and stand next to me ( right here ! )
est , everyone stand together
and if i , ever r - i - p , then i know everything i stand for's forever
lace up !
and when you play this song
hold your head high , muthafucker
don't ever look down because of who you are
our flaws are what makes us perfect
