merry , merry , merry go round
i don’t want to see you down
i don’t want to see you frown
merry go round...
look...
summer day
bobby and this girl would wake up every summer day
this boy and girl had nothing , they were runaways
so in love that now all they wanted was pain and so it came
never had a silver spoon present in the past
now at last , the spoon is present and so the boy wet it
told her bring him a slab , a cotton swab , and a match
and told her one day they’ll fly across the world and have a wedding
like “baby i have a plan , come with me to this place
baby give me your hand , now flip it give me a vein
baby take off your belt , we’ll use it as a restraint”
she sees that it starts to melt , he reaches inside a case
fills the needle with food , flicks the needle with haste
brings the needle to her , she isn’t right in the face
the boy can tell that she’s scared , he says “i love you , okay ? ”
then shoves it into her arm and says “how the fuck does that taste baby ? ! ”
merry , merry , merry go round
i don’t want to see you down
i don’t want to see you frown
merry go round...
merry , merry , merry go round
i don’t want to see you down
i don’t want to see you frown
merry , merry , merry go round
her dress drops , her head drops
swiggin’ out of a whiskey bottle , he just watches
but he was not bobby , see bobby had joined the army
been gone for a couple months now she’s messin with everybody
everyone of the dealers , everyone hears her squealing
trading pussy for product , she did anything for that feeling
but then she started that feeling , early morning she’s kneelin’
in front of the toilet look at her belly there’s no concealing
that she’s expecting a child
this woman is living foul
she’s only 20 years old
and hardly can even smile
ultrasound shows a baby that’s barely over a pound
sold everything in her house just trying to score an ounce
news of her baby’s father was that he died in the war
now that syringe is all that keeps her alive anymore
no mattress , so her and her child dyin’ on the floor
as a letter’s at the door reading :
“i’ll be home tomorrow. love , bobby”
merry , merry , merry go round
i don’t want to see you down
i don’t want to see you frown
merry go round...
merry , merry , merry go round
i don’t want to see you down
i don’t want to see you frown
merry , merry , merry go round
knockin’ at the door but doesn’t get an answer
bobby’s nervous , his heart starts to beat faster
he hasn’t talked to his girl in so long
she sold his phone for a hit , damn how he wish that he could hear her laughter
but his drug hit her like a cancer
and he forgot ‘cause he had left and cleaned his act up
passenger seat in his acura got a picture of ‘em kissing
under the words " happily ever after”
he walks into the house , it’s a fuckin’ disaster
every step he takes his shoe crushes a capsule
holds his breath , he knows what he smells isn’t natural
looks down , it’s the body of the queen of his castle
“baby please , baby please ! ! ! "
" wake up ! ! ! ”
he screams on his knees and he sees her hands around her stomach
inside was a child
and realizes it was his…
*gun cock* *gun shot*
summer day ,
an entire family died on that summer day
‘cause a facade made a girl give her love away
but those were bobby’s consequences that he had to pay
love is pain
merry , merry , merry go round
i don’t want to see you down
i don’t want to see you frown
merry go round...
merry , merry , merry go round
i don’t want to see you down
i don’t want to see you frown
merry , merry , merry go round
