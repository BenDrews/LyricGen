voices in the air
i hear them loud and clear
telling me to listen
whispers in my ear
nothing can compare
i just wanna listen
as my , world turns
the heart beats
not only in my chest
but the heart in these streets
so when they feel this , they feel me
but i can't feel nothin' , outside these dre beats
i am from the city of evil , came from the bottom
standing on top of what was supposed to be my coffin , whats up ?
inception shows me as a dead man walkin' , but reflections shows this kid's still got it
let it be known i got the throne like i don't know that there's a king
never grew up around a family because i'm not a human being
and anyone under my level that’s coming at my spot for the top
let them have it , cause when i leave , the whole world drops
lace up kells
i hear voices in the air
i hear em’ loud and clear
telling me to listen
whispers in my ear
nothing can compare
i just want to listen
telling me i am invincible ( 3x ) - oh oh
telling me i am invincible ( 3x ) - oh oh i am
waking up sweatin from the stress of being caged down
everything i write is played out like what is this ?
tear the whole page out
man i come from holes in the wall but they don’t know the path
even if i told them it all , they wouldn't know the half
so maybe i fill up my luggage with all of these dreams and put on my black coat and my black chucks and nothing in my jeans
and just run , till the day comes like rocky’s movie scene
and i’m on top of the world , look up and scream like this is me , this is kells
crucified by the public without the nails
do or die in my city but clearly i never failed
lost myself in the game when i found myself in a cell
then i found myself in the fame when i lost myself in the pills
and you cannot mess with me still , seen them boys and they winnin
underdogs of the year cleveland boys in the buildin'
what the fuck is a ceiling i’m taking this to the top , and when i leave the whole world drops lace up kells
i hear voices in the air
i hear em’ loud and clear
telling me to listen
whispers in my ear nothing can compare
i just want to listen
telling me i am invincible ( 3x ) - oh oh
telling me i am invincible ( 3x ) - oh oh i am…..
