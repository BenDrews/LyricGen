*intro guitar*
am i loud and clear ?
or do i gotta scream like i did every day when i was a troubled teen , huh ?
do you want to know my past and see every single scar and know what they mean , huh ?
17 running up in mickey d's begging for a double cheese , huh
singing " i don't want to grow up don’t nobody like you when your 23 "
i came from nothing but a fucking unsupportive father i don't ever see
i had to watch a crooked jury put my brother in the penitentiary ,
i never fit in
criticism , made me the man i couldn't be
i'm reminiscing on when life was different spending every day at chuckee cheese , uh
we live on front porches and swing life away
we get by just fine here on minimum wage
if love is a labor i’ll slave till the end
and i’ll run these streets if you give me a chance
i've been here so long
maybe i should runaway
try to find a summer day
what is love
love is pain
love is butterflies and stomach aches
love is looking out a windowpane , tears dripping looking like you’re in the rain
for someone you don't even know but for somebody you may never see again
i am only alive once
and i'mma die when god wants
so fill the sky with diamonds
because that's how it's gonna look when i'm gone
had a vision as a kid that one day i would change the world with my song
several years have passed and now that vision came to life that boy's a fucking icon
sometimes i don't want to fucking wake up
when all they want to do is bring me down
and all the things i’ve went through as i came up
are the fucking reasons why i run this town
we live on front porches and swing life away
( and to my fans , i told you )
we get by just fine here on minimum wage
if love is a labor i’ll slave till the end
and i’ll run these streets if you give me a chance
we live on front porches and swing life away
( all my dreamers )
we get by just fine here on minimum wage
( stay real )
if love is a labor i’ll slave till the end
( and to my love )
and i’ll run these streets if you give me a chance
( stay here )
swing life away
( what we do )
swing life away
( and what we do )
swing life away
( yeah )
swing life away
( and we just )
swing life away
( lets swing life away )
swing life away
( lets swing life away )
swing life away
( lets swing life away )
swing life away
