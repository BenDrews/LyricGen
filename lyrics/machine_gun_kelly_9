​i screamed at the top of my lungs
​but my voice couldn't save this home
​you're proud of the guns you hold
​what's left now ?
​where can we go ?
​yo
​i had a dream that the world changed
​and for a minute there was no pain
​instead of presidents and old sayings
​i heard lyrics from kurt cobain
​then i wake up to see the world's ill
​oceans tainted from the oil spills
​how many kids have these wars killed ?
​how many families can't afford bills ?
​i wish that i could let the world know
​that it's okay to let the pain show
​and even though times seem bad
​it always rains before the rainbow.​
​i screamed at the top of my lungs
​but my voice couldn't save this home
​you're proud of the guns you hold
​what's left now ?
​where can we go ?
​i think we all need a little more love
​i think we all need a little more love
​we just need a little more love
​the world needs a little more love
​kells
​in my hood money equals power
​and in the world money controls everything we believe in
​i can see we're in our darkest hour
​'​cause it feels like the government just as crooked as the police
​i spent the weekend catching up on the news
​a girl committed suicide after she was bullied at school
​'​cause some dudes told her she wasn't cool
​but you would rather gossip about a famous person breaking the rules
​i'm confused
​tell me is my life's price worth the jewels ?
​they told me fight night i'm supposed to lose
​just ​'​cause in hindsight , they don't like my type :
​white boy with some rhythm and blues
​kells
​i screamed at the top of my lungs
​but my voice couldn't save this home
​you're proud of the guns you hold
​what's left now ?
​where can we go ?
​i think we all need a little more love
​i think we all need a little more love
​we just need a little more love
​the world needs a little more love
​you can give up like they tell you
​stop like they tell you
​be scared to dream for the top like they tell you
​but i'm trying to tell you
​fuck what they tell you
​i think we all
​*choir in the background singing*
​ " we all need a little more love "
​and in these dark times
​as a part of a generation they claim can't be saved it’s important to know we’re not blind
​we see the truth through blue and dark eyes
​and i would rather die on my feet then live on my knees if i can't live free
​right now in the world we just need
​a little more love
​a little more love
​a little more love
