sex on my mind thinkin' 'bout when i get you alone
you already know it's goin' down when i get you alone
you know what i came here to do when i get you alone
i'ma give it all to you when i get you , when i get you alone
you know it , you know you in trouble , when i get you alone
thinking 'bout the places i touch you , when i get you alone
and we can turn the cellphones off baby , when i get you alone
cause everything you need is right here , right here , right here baby
cause i'm tryna see what's up with tonight
and i love the way your body looks up underneath these lights
so don't say it's wrong , when it feels right
cause i'm looking at your apple and i wanna take a bite
tonight i need some entertainment , when i get you alone
take all them clothes off let's get naked , when i get you alone
baby let me kiss you somewhere sacred , when i get you alone
cause i got what you need and it's right here , right here , right here , right here baby
say the hottest topic ain't about your body babe , that's the truth
pull up in a rover and all these people tellin' me , that's the crew
if i had you to myself then god damn baby that's a coup
know you need some peace of mind , them legs up to the ceiling that's the deuce ( of peace )
any time of day you got me , gotta keep it straight up , no juice
i got a cabbana up in cancun
we can fuck from r. kelly to lil boosie
with yo' bad ass
i'm a fat kid for that fat ass
cake
love it how you make a nigga wait
girl your body got me far from sober
whenever we get alone , it's over
yeah , it's over
only if , if i get you alone
promise it be alright , when i get you alone
yeah i know you keep plans and i know you got friends
for once can we get this alone
promise it be alright , alone
