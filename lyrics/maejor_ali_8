when it all goes down , we still gon' be there
keep your circle close my nigga
choose wisely , who you remember , who you forget
you understand ?
everybody flow with you in the yacht
but will they save you when you drown ?
they say it's lonely at the top
but i'm too fly to touch the ground
i lost a lot of people to this music , shit
man , we don't talk no more
when i think about , it kinda hurts my heart
that we don't talk no more
see i'm blaming you and you blaming me
that we don't talk no more
we don't talk no more
we don't talk no more
all the different niggas that i went to school with
we don't talk no more

and it's no surprise
we don't realise
what we have until it's gone

to every pretty girl who ever held me down
i know we don't talk no more
i really understand that it was my fault
that we don't talk no more

it's the only reason we don't talk no more
so you know don't take it personal
and to my old label
i'm kinda glad that we don't talk no more
since we parted ways i'm going h.a.m
now that we don't talk no more
a lot of niggas here are lookin' bad
now that we don't talk no more
we don't talk no more

she said i let the fame get to my head
that's why we don't talk no more
bitch , i ain't famous yet , quit textin' me
we don't talk no more
a nigga got zero time for drama
that might be why we don't talk no more
if we don't talk no more
to everyone you love , make sure you tell 'em
'fore you don't talk no more
you never know , that time can come
when you don't talk no more
and i pray and never see the day
that we don't talk no more
we don't talk no more
we don't talk no more
