nothing you say
will ever be wrong
cause it just feels good being in your arms
and i'm running with you
as fast as i can
singing to myself i wanna hold your hand
and we're going downtown
cause we feel like running around
is it really this fun when you're on my mind
is it really this cool to be in your life
there's one thing i'll do
if it ever goes wrong
i'll write you into my all of my songs
and if suddenly i die
i hope they will say
that he was obsessed and it was okay
cause we're going downtown
and we feel like running around
is it really this fun when you're on my mind
is it really this cool to be in your life
and i'm going crazy
crazy for you
i'm going crazy
crazy for you
i'm going crazy
crazy for you
i'm going crazy
crazy for you
for you
