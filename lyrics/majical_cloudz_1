the cheesiest songs all end with a smile
this won’t end with a smile , my love
wait with me in slimy wet darkness
i’ll be right beside you , my love
bugs don’t buzz when their time approaches
we’ll be just like the roaches , my love
it pays to be on the edge of existence
just riding the surface , my love
the happiest songs all end with a smile
this might end with a smile , no my love
if life could be forever one instant
would it be the moment you met me ? no my love
