someone died
gun - shot , right outside
your father , he's dead
i see him in my head
childhood's end
goodbye , my holy friend
love me , it's a sin
can you see me caving in ?
weighing down , weighing down , weighing down
weighing down , weighing down , weighing down
it's weighing down , weighing down , weighing down
on me , me , me
me , me , me
me , me , me
me , me , me
yeah
brothers feel
killing time standing in the field
our fate , it is sealed
at birth we made a deal
i don't cry
god tell me why
love death
night flight
best friend crucified
won't someone come home
won't someone come home
won't someone come home
won't someone come home
won't someone for me , me , me
me , me , me
me , me , me
me , me , me
yeah
