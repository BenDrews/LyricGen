i never show it
but i am always laughing
i want to kiss you
inside a car thatâ€™s crashing
and we will both die laughing
cause there is nothing left to do
and we will both die laughing
while i am holding onto you
i will be honest
i am afraid of love
if i'm not perfect
then it will let me starve
but i am always perfect
when i am holding onto you
and i know love is worth it
i am in perfect love with you
i want to show you
the funny dream i'm having
my head splits open
for all the camera's flashing
but i am dead already
and i am bleeding onto you
i hope you won't forget me
i am so hopelessly for you
