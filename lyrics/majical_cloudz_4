red wine and sleeping pills
you’re gonna die so you say , but you’re here still
you feel okay ; you’re just tired of the feelings you have for yourself
cheap sex and sad films
i’m gonna leave so i say but i’m here still
i feel okay ; i’m just tired of the things that i’ve already tried
man if you lose your balance , you will fall
do you hear what i’m saying , or not at all ?
are you alone ? what do you say ?
i don’t know what i would not do to know
2c - i and 2c - b
crash your car ; lie down in the street
falling asleep ‘cause you’re so tired that the world doesn’t spin anymore
what’s the point of a sad , sad song ?
do you hear me or not at all ?
are you alone ? what do you say ?
i don’t know what i would not do to know
