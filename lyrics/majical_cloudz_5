me and my friend neil
it's just how we feel
no one here's gonna step on our toes
when we're out together
nothing could be better
catching spots and watching shows
hey , i think that you're the best friend that i could ever have
hey , i know now if i'll be gone for sure
?
me and my friend neil
we go where we feel like
no one's gonna step on our toes
out on the end of palm street
that's where me and neil meet
to go everywhere that we go
hey , what was that ?
we've been livin' in the same spot for five years
i , didn't know then that i'd be around for a long
time , yeah
me and my friend neil
we go where we feel like
we don't need anyone to step on our toes
and when we go out on fridays
we come back on saturdays
me and him painting until the sun rose
hey , what was that ? you're the best friend i have ever had
i , didn't think about it until now , that i'll be gone for a small time
yeah
