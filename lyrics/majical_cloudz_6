we will dance on our way to heaven
we will dance on our way to heaven
you say , " when i'm dead , i will never be afraid again "
you say , " when i'm dead , i will never be afraid again "
fall down , standing up is boring
fall down , standing up is boring
you say , " when i'm dead , i will never feel this strange again "
you say , " when i'm dead , i will never feel this strange again "
i sing about this feeling
and i love it when you hear me
i sing about this feeling
we won't always feel it
we're on our way to heaven
you laugh , standing in the mirror
you laugh , standing in the mirror
and in a day , you will never be this young again
and in a day , you will never be this young again
i sing about this feeling
and i love it when you hear me
i sing about this feeling
we won't always feel it
we're on our way to heaven
when we're dead , dead , dead , dead , dead
we will dance , dance , dance , dance , dance
when we're dead , dead , dead , dead , dead
we will dance , dance , dance , dance , dance
on our way to heaven
on our way to heaven
on our way to heaven
