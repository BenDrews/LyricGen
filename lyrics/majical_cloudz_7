one summer i fell in love
for the first time
it would change my whole life
i would learn to love someone
and not be alone
so slowly the love went away
and i was frozen
i didn't want to lose that love
i didn't want to leave behind
part of myself
i was lonely
but i felt afraid of being loved
i thought i didn't need the pain
i thought that in my heart
i had to be on my own
now i see it
i was wrong to feel that i couldn't feel love
that i couldn't love again
that i couldn't make new friends
and be someone new
so if you're lonely
you don't have to be
all alone
no one has to be that way
no one has to be afraid of being loved
