will you let me change
i want to but i think you want me the same
and i know that it's not a game
i want to move really slow
and while i dance can i tell you about control
of my body in the eyes of my soul
would you control me
would you lock me up and then never set me free
would you , i am on my knees
is this going too slow
you think so but we won't speed it up , no no
cause i like it when the song goes slow
can i try to be you
can i dress up in your clothes and be somebody new
can i dance in a pair of your shoes
