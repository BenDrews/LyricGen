blue moon
yesterday
i wasn't here for you
go on now
in the way you do
try not to be
so blue
so blue
so blue
blue moon
it is strange
how you appear
whenever you do
go on now
you will say
you already do
but try not to be
so blue
so blue
so blue
blue moon
in the rain
i wanted to say
i need you
but i felt so
in the way
of you
i'll try not to be
so blue
i'll try not to be so blue
so blue
i'll try not to be so blue
so blue
so blue
so blue
blue , blue
