i've got an unfortunate feeling
i been beaten down
i feel that i'm done believing
now the truth is coming out
what they've taken is more than a vow
they've taken your innocence
and then they throw em on a burning pile
all along they're saying
" mind your manners ! "
i caught myself believing
that i needed god
and if it's out there somewhere
we sure could use hymn now
try my patience !
my patience tried
this world's a long love letter
that makes me want to cry
ah ah ay ay
that's all they're saying
self - realized and metaphysically redeemed
may not live another life
may not solve a mystery
right around the corner
could be bigger than ourselves
we could will it to the sky
or we could something else
and all along they're saying
mind your manners
always praying
go to heaven
that's swell
how do you like your living hell ?
