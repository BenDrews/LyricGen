madman drummers bummers
indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
in the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
with a boulder on my shoulder
feelin' kinda older
i tripped the merry - go - round
with this very unpleasin'
sneezin' and wheezin'
the calliope crashed to the ground
the calliope crashed to the ground
but she was...
blinded by the light
revved up like a deuce
another runner in the night

but mama , that's where the fun is
but mama , that's where the fun is
mama always told me not to look into the eye's of the sun
but mama , that's where the fun is
some brimstone baritone anticyclone rolling stone preacher from the east
says , " dethrone the dictaphone
hit it in it's funny bone , that's where they expect it least "
and some new - mown chaperone
was standin' in the corner , watching the young girls dance
and some fresh - sown moonstone
was messin' with his frozen zone , reminding him of romance
the calliope crashed to the ground
but she was...
