1/a story of unbundling in the tech industry : 20 years of consumer internet evolution
2/one upon a time there was aol , which was a completely integrated internet access/information/communication service.
3/then yahoo came along and unbundled the information/communication parts like email/im/sports - scores/stock - quotes from the access service.
4/one of the things you could do on yahoo was search , then google came along and unbundled that.
5/you can search for anything on google , including people ; facebook came along with a much better way to just search for people.
6/three things you can do on facebook are messaging , photo sharing , and status updates ; therefore whatsapp , instagram , and twitter.
7/and yes , yo unbundles the creation & existence of a message from the contents of a message , unbundling whatsapp and twitter : - ) .
8/ev williams ( @ev ) is the modern genius of this concept - - playing out in our industry continuously since the 1950's.
9/the part people often miss is that you can get extremely powerful second/third order effects at each step with his pattern.
10/the entrepreneurs generally have a pretty good sense of this when they're doing it , but it doesn't become clear to others until later.
11/this is a pattern what we love to fund : unbundle x from y , but then use the liberation of x as leverage to do amazing new things with x.
12/and the howls of press and analyst outrage at the apparent stupidity of each unbundling are very helpful for keeping valuations down : - ) .
1/the flip side of unbundling : later on , the unbundlers tend to try to rebundle in the image of whatever they unbundled.
2/so yahoo adds an isp and google adds email/im/sports - scores/stock - quotes.
3/twitter changes its user profile page to look more like facebook : - ) .
4/sun unbundled dec with commodity components , then re - bundled into a proprietary computing stack just like dec w/solaris , sparc , etc.
5/microsoft likewise unbundled dec minicomputers w/pc os + tools , then rebundled into dec - like integrated stack now including hardware ( ! ) .
6/paraphrasing harvey dent : " you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the company you first competed with. "
7/and then sometimes the rebundlers realize what they're doing and try to reverse course. e.g. microsoft building apps for ios & android.
8/and thus the cycle of life repeats with yet more unbundling : - ) .
