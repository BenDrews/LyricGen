over the last several weeks , there have been erroneous reports in the press that my partner jeff jordan and/or i might become an operating executive of yahoo in some capacity
to be crystal clear , neither jeff , nor i , nor any of our partners at andreessen horowitz , are in the running for , or would accept , any operating role at yahoo , including ceo , acting ceo , chairman , or executive chairman
jeff and i have high regard for yahoo , but we are fully committed to our day jobs as general partners at andreessen horowitz and board members of our portfolio companies
