cash burn rates at startups : recently @bgurley and @fredwilson have sounded a vivid alarm - - http : //online.wsj.com/articles/venture - capitalist - sounds - alarm - on - silicon - valley - risk - 1410740054 http : //avc.com/2014/09/burn - baby - burn/
i said at the time that i agree with much of what bill says ( https : //twitter.com/pmarca/status/511617992757506048 ) , and i want to expand on the topic further :
new founders in last 10 years have only been in environment where money is always easy to raise at higher valuations. that will not last.
when the market turns , and it will turn , we will find out who has been swimming without trunks on : many high burn rate co's will vaporize.
high cash burn rates are dangerous in several ways beyond the obvious increased risk of running out of cash. important to understand why :
first : high burn rate kills your ability to adapt as you learn & as market changes. co becomes unwieldy , too big to easily change course.
second : hiring people is easy ; layoffs are devastating. hiring for startups is effectively one way street. again , can't change once stuck.
third : your managers get trained and incented only to hire , as answer to every question. company bloats & becomes badly run at same time.
fourth : lots of people , big shiny office , high expense base = fake " we've made it ! " feeling. removes pressure to deliver real results.
fifth : more people multiplies communication overhead exponentially , slows everything down. company bogs down , becomes bad place to work.
sixth : raising new money becomes harder & harder. you have bigger bulldog to feed , need more and more $ at higher and higher valuations.
therefore you take on escalating risk of a catastrophic down round. high - cash - burn startups almost never survive down rounds. vaporize.
further , to get into this position , you probably had to raise too much $ at too high valuation before ; escalates down round risk further.
seventh : even if you can raise an up round , you are increasingly likely to incur terrible structural terms like ratchets to chin the bar.
that nice hedge fund investor willing to hit your valuation bar ? imagine him owning 80% of co after down round. how nice will he be then ?
eighth : when market turns , m&a mostly stops. nobody will want to buy your cash - incinerating startup. there will be no plan b. vaporize.
finally , there are exceptions to all this. but if you're reading this , you're almost certainly not one. they are few and far between.
worry.
