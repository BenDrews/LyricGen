i’ve cussed on a sunday
i’ve cheated and i’ve lied
i’ve fallen down from grace
a few too many times
but i find holy redemption
when i put this car in drive
roll the windows down and turn up the dial
can i get a hallelujah
can i get an amen
feels like the holy ghost running through ya
when i play the highway fm
i find my soul revival
singing every single verse
yeah i guess that’s my church
when hank bring the sermon
and cash leads the choir
it gets my cold , cold heart burning
hotter than a ring of fire
when this wonderful world gets heavy
and i need to find my escape
i just keep the wheels rolling , radio scrolling
until my sins wash away
can i get a hallelujah
can i get an amen
feels like the holy ghost running through ya
when i play the highway fm
i find my soul revival
singing every single verse
yeah i guess that’s my church
can i get a hallelujah
can i get an amen
feels like the holy ghost running through ya
when i play the highway fm
i find my soul revival
singing every single verse
yeah i guess that’s my church
can i get a hallelujah
can i get an amen
feels like the holy ghost running through ya
when i play the highway fm
i find my soul revival
singing every single verse
yeah i guess that’s my church
yeah i guess that’s my church
yeah i guess that’s my church
