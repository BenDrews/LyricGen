still runs good , built to last
moves like a hula girl on the dash
she ain't made for practicality
yeah , i guess she's just like me
it's saturday night , about time to go
got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
once i turn on the radio , i'm ready to roll
feel like a hard - to - get starlet when i'm driving
turning every head , hell , i ain't even trying
got them ray - ban shades , pretty in pink
call me old school , but hey
i'm a 90s baby in my 80s mercedes
i'm a 90s baby in my 80s mercedes
pop the top down like a summer dream
she's my teenage time machine
just keeps getting sweeter with age
she's classic through any decade
the suns in the sky , glitter on the seats
you can try , but the benz is hard to beat
so , hey , if you want you can ride with me
feel like a hard - to - get starlet when i'm driving
turning every head , hell , i ain't even trying
got them ray - ban shades , pretty in pink
call me old school , but hey
i'm a 90s baby in my 80s mercedes
i'm a 90s baby in my 80s mercedes
it's saturday night , about time to go
got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
once i turn on the radio , i'm ready to roll
feel like a hard - to - get starlet when i'm driving
turning every head , hell , i ain't even trying
got them ray - ban shades , pretty in pink
call me old school , but hey
i'm a 90s baby in my 80s mercedes
i'm a 90s baby in my 80s mercedes
