what you do with trash ? you take it out
so why are you letting him hang around ?
girl , you gotta know when to clean house
and throw his shit out in the yard
if it was the first time , i would understand
but it's the third time - he got a second chance
there's a fine line between an accident
and an l - o - s - e - r
it's bullshit , you know it
yeah , i see it in your eyes
every time that you tell me
deep down he's a really good guy
that's like saying
drunk girls don't cry
girl , you must be outta your
damn mind
you say he saw the light , the slate is clean
he swears up and down that it's gonna be
different this time
that's like saying drunk girls don't cry
another weekend , another box of wine
i heard it so much i got it memorized
if you think he's the one then you must be blind
or c - r - a - z - y
c'mon , it's bullshit , you know it
i wish i had a dime for
every time that you tell me
deep down he's a really good guy
that's like saying
drunk girls don't cry
girl , you must be outta your
damn mind
you say he saw the light , the slate is clean
he swears up and down that it's gonna be
different this time
that's like saying drunk girls don't cry
that's like saying
drunk girls don't cry
girl , you must be outta your
damn mind
you say he saw the light , the slate is clean
he swears up and down that it's gonna be
different this time
that's like saying drunk girls don't cry
