on paper we go together
i know that we look the part
but almost never hangs on forever
i know i'm breaking your heart
so go on , say what you want to
i'm not gonna stop you
you can blame it all on me
i'm not the hero in the story
i'm not the girl that gets the glory
'cause you're looking for true love
and i'm not the one
but i wish , but i wish i was
wish i could feel about you
the way you feel about me
but you can't make a heart say something
that it don't believe
so go on , hate me if you have to
i hate myself too
'cause as much as i want to be
i'm not the hero in the story
i'm not the girl that gets the glory
'cause you're looking for true love
and i'm not the one
but i wish , but i wish i was
go on , hate me if you have to
i still care about you
as much as i want to be
i'm not the hero in the story
i'm not the girl that gets the glory
'cause you're looking for true love
and i'm not the one
but i wish , but i wish i was
