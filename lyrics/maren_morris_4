everyone's always talking 'bout
their favorite destination
where they're gonna go
on their next vacation
gotta make that flashy reservation
don't want to wait in line
but when i'm sitting on the couch
and i'm looking at the pictures
the background's only a secondary fixture
where we went for dinner ?
shoot , i don't remember
but we had a good time
together , together
we can do whatever
whatever
we can walk right up the street
where the locals roll
we ain't gotta go international
baby , just drive in a park and party
we don't need no hollywood suite
ooh , don't matter what we do
anything with you sounds fine to me
it's all about the company you keep
yeah , 'bout the company you keep
so c'mon , keep me company
ooh
listen , when it comes down to it
nobody really cares
where you had your birthday
just who was there
buy you a shot , then hold back your hair
take you to waffle house
we're the circles that you're running
when you're running around
bail you out , make you laugh
pick you up when you're down
hanging out in your hometown
hey , that's what it's all about
whatever , whatever
we're all in it together
birds of a feather
we can walk right up the street
where the locals roll
we ain't gotta go international
baby , just drive in a park and party
we don't need no hollywood suite
ooh , don't matter what we do
anything with you sounds fine to me
it's all about the company you keep
yeah , 'bout the company you keep
so c'mon , keep me company
we can walk right up the street
where the locals roll
we ain't gotta go international
baby , just drive in a park and party
we don't need no hollywood suite
ooh , don't matter what we do
anything with you sounds fine to me
it's all about the company you keep
yeah , 'bout the company you keep
so c'mon , keep me company
whatever , we're all in it together
so c'mon , keep me company
