darling , please , we were too gone to stay
couldn't get through the night , so we had to call it a day
the words came out ; they couldn't be erased
saw the pain in your eyes , and i knew everything had changed
i'm a traitor , i'm the cause
i'm the breaker of your heart
i ain't saying what you want
but baby , please , know that if
somehow we make it alive
and both get out on the other side
oh , this might be asking a lot
when it's all said and done , don't forget that you loved me once
it's been months ; i'm still seeing signs of you
things that you wanted me to read , shit that you wanted me to do
if i'm left in the deepest part of your mind , it's cool
oh , it's cool
yeah , it hurts , i agree
you're still the first part of me
i know i set you free
but baby , please , know that if
somehow we make it alive
and both get out on the other side
oh , this might be asking a lot
when it's all said and done , don't forget that you loved me once
somehow we make it alive
and both get out on the other side
oh , this might be asking a lot
when it's all said and done , don't forget that you loved me once
i know this might be asking a lot
when it's all said and done , don't forget that you loved me once
