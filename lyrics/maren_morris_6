boy i’ve been cooking up one hell of a crush
i’ve got you on my mind the minute i wake up
you make the morning glow , make the rooster crow , get my juices flowing
you know i got the spice but it ain’t enough
baby would you be my sugar , sugar ?
make my heart race , even on a good day
you make the world taste better , better
good on anything , want you on everything
just a little bit is all it takes
like a coca - cola on a christmas day
you’re what i crave babe , what can i say ?
would you , would you
would you be my sugar , sugar ?
tried the fake shit but it ain’t the same
a girl just knows when it’s the real thing
yeah i’m a cup of tea with a touch of cream but something’s missing
so i’m gonna put this nice and sweet
baby would you be my sugar , sugar ?
make my heart race , even on a good day
you make the world taste better , better
good on anything , want you on everything
just a little bit is all it takes
like a coca - cola on a christmas day
you’re what i crave babe , what can i say ?
would you , would you
would you be my sugar , sugar ?
would you be my sugar , sugar ?
sugar sugar , you make my heart race
even on a good day you make the world taste
better better , good on anything
just a little bit is all that it takes
sugar , sugar
make my heart race , even on a good day
you make the world taste better , better
good on anything , want you on everything
just a little bit is all it takes
like a coca - cola on a christmas day
you’re what i crave babe , what can i say ?
would you , would you
would you be my sugar , sugar ?
would you be my sugar , sugar ?
