usually a drink will do the trick
take the edge off quick , sitting in the dark
with a shared cigarette
seeing eye - to - eye , and heart - to - heart
but maybe i’m just getting old
used to work but now it don’t
a long gone drive
you know the kind where you take a turn
and you don’t know why
but it clears your mind , a surefire cure
i need something stronger
that’ll last a little longer
i could use a love song
that takes me back , just like that
when it comes on
to a time when i wouldn’t roll my eyes
at a guy and a girl
who make it work in a world
that for me so far just seems to go so wrong
yeah i could use , i could use a love song
i wish i didn’t know so much
i peeked behind the curtain
now that magic rush
feels like a trick that isn’t working
but i haven’t lost all hope yet
yeah it’s hurting but it ain’t dead
i could use a love song
that takes me back , just like that
when it comes on
to a time when i wouldn’t roll my eyes
at a guy and a girl
who make it work in a world
that for me so far just seems to go so wrong
yeah i could use , i could use a love song
give me a sign or a rhyme or a reason
just something that i can believe in
i could use a love song
that takes me back , just like that
when it comes on
to a time when i wouldn’t roll my eyes
at a guy and a girl
who make it work in a world
that for me so far just seems to go so wrong
yeah i could use
yeah i could use , i could use a love song
