i need to get more sleep
i been stayin’ up all night
maybe when i drink , i need to stick to red wine
i need to pick up the phone
see what’s going on back home
just admit , when i’m with him , i still feel alone
i been going down a road
that’s a little too traveled
i should find the common thread
that makes it all unravel
like laying down my dollar
just for a temporary high
i gotta quit bummin’ cigarettes
from the wrong guys
i should slow this train
and take my own advice
stop saying that some day , gonna make it right
it’s just a red light , it’s just a wrong turn
another drag on a friday night
it’s about time i learned
i been going down a road
that’s a little too traveled
i should find the common thread
that makes it all unravel
like laying down my dollar
just for a temporary high
and i gotta quit bummin’ cigarettes
from the wrong guys
oh
i been going down a road
that’s a little too traveled
i should find the common thread
that makes it all unravel
like laying down my dollar
just for a temporary high
and i gotta quit bummin’ cigarettes
from the wrong guys
stop laying down my heart
and find my own light
i got to quit bummin’ cigarettes
from the wrong guys
