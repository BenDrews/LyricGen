pound me the witch drums , witch drums
pound me the witch drums
pound me the witch drums , the witch drums
better pray for hell , not hallelujah
i'm the curled up fists
dead and hardened spiders
like two mangled crowns
on the white heads of the meanest coiled snakes
folks say that i
look like death
lived in the hotel of my eyes
blinds wide open like a whore
paid in spit from that hearse between her thighs
keep your halos tight
i'm your god or your guardian
keep your halo tight
one hand on the trigger , the other hand in mine
because now
cupid carries a gun
now , now
cupid , cupid carries a gun
she had those crow - black eyes
starless , but she fucked like a comet
she laid as still as a bible
and it felt like revelations when i looked inside
