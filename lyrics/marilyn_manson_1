this world doesn't need no opera
we're here for the operation
we don't need a bigger knife
cause we got guns
we got guns , we got guns
we got guns , you better run
we're killing strangers
we're killing strangers
we're killing strangers so we don't kill the ones that we
love , love , love , love
we pack demolition
we can't pack emotion
dynamite , we just might
so blow us a kiss , blow us a kiss
blow us a kiss , and we'll blow you to pieces
and we got guns , we got guns
motherfuckers better , better run
we got , we got guns
motherfuckers better run
you better run
we got guns , we got guns , we got guns
