i don't know if i cannot open up
i've been opened enough
i don't know if i can open up
i'm not a birthday present
i'm aggressive aggressive
the past is over
now the passive seems so pathetic
are we fated , faithful , or fatal ?
are we fated , faithful , or fatal ?
i'm feeling stoned and alone like a heretic
and i'm ready to meet my maker
i feel stoned and alone like a heretic
i'm ready to meet my maker
lazarus got no dirt on me
lazarus got no dirt on me
and i rise to every occasion
i'm the mephistopheles of los angeles
of los angeles
don't know if i cannot open up
i've been opened too much
double - crossed and glossed over in my pathos
