we've only reached the third day of our seven - day binge
and i can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
we've only reached the third day of a seven - day binge
i can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
i can't decide if you're wearing me out or wearing me well
i just feel like i'm condemned to wear someone else's hell
we've only reached the third day of our seven - day binge
i can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
i've got bullets , in the booth
rather be your victim , than be with you
i got bullets , in the boothe
rather be your victim , than be with you
we've only reached the third day of a seven - day binge
i can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
i'd rather be your victim , than to be with you
rather be your victim , than be with you
