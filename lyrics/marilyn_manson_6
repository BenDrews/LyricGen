devil's got a cut , like a slit in a cattles calf
dollar sign snakes , i'm all in the damned
godless , fearless of the flood
or the blood of the coming spring
something is shedding its scales
crying from the heat of the light
or the empty shell on the stage
and cash is a poor man's money
and cash is a poor man's money
you say " god " , and i say " say 10 "
you say " god " , and i say " say 10 "
say , say , say 10
