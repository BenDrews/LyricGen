you're a paper doll
i'll fold you how i want
you're not my noose
i tied this knot
if this won't be
our fingers locked together
then this is total war
method not objective
you can't ever say that i'm breaking the rules
if i can't glue them back together
scars on my fingers , bruises , my neck
crashin' my trains , warship my wreck
cut the hands off
kamikaze into your soul
worship my wreck
