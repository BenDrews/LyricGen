looking on various street corners
i'm sure you've seen it yourself
standing on the corner , is an alleged brother
dressed in blue , or green , red and black
and starting the news , that the revolution is coming
and you better get ready , sort of like ( i feel you son )
the end of the world is coming , unfortunately ( i got you , though )
the world is just gonna drag on and on ( i know how it is )
and we have a poem that we've written particularly ( i said i know how it is )
for the brothers on the street corners
when the revolution come , you can see me on the front line
firing my gun , standing right beside my son
if i go , it's understood that i stood for something
when my whole life , they told me , i was good for nothing
i was raised by the stray dogs , blazed off , layed off
breaking laws , graveyard shifting every day war
focus now , notice how , things change , soldier
i remain the same , i'm older now , i embrace the pain
i blame the struggle , nearly drove me insane
thought i lost my head , till my brethren told me the same
no tears for the reaper , i've buried bout a thousand
in graffiti , " rest in peace " sprayed off throughout the housing
i tried to stay civilized , the hood's a prison inside
the only difference is the doors don't slide
still we trapped in the animal cage , cause we got animal ways
so we react , with the animal rage
and my section's real , weapons peel , cheddar's the deal
seen the depths of hell , now i stare , death in the grill
from the slave ships , to today's bricks , same shit
i'm awake , to the wickedness , and one , with the pavement
the all great mind stays divine , my hands remain deadly
we shine without the hung jewelry , produce light
that'll travel through mics , now as the time riping
we took words that we nourishing , encouraging
a nation to awaken , those who were sleeping
can you conceive the thought ? transatlantic import
slave and bought , secret relations between blacks and jews
might set a fuse off in the head
many dead lynch hung , swung from trees
brothers in the struggle together , eat from one pot
hold each other down to the sneaker
nothing come between us
fast money and chicks , did it to the best of cliques
it's sickening... huh
it's me and you son , forever in the struggle
no doubt , we hustle , survival is the motto
will you soon follow , a better tomorrow
...for a better tomorrow
i catch a few flashbacks about , going through the struggle
how we used to make dollars , from all the snow we shoveled
in a broke neighborhood , where the kids often dream
about a lavish life , that is mostly seen in the screen
where some dreams are quickly cut short , due to gang violence
from loud guns , that kept witnesses , in deep silence
was it bad timing ? jealousy from too much shining ?
or a set up , from a girl that he wined , kept dining
it's a known fact , they will attack , cause it's like that
and depending on the , kind of impact , that strike back
in a town where the talk is cheap and , beef is brief
a mother sobs uncontrollably , and exhibit the grief
large holes in the front door , of a housing tenement
allows room to retaliate , so conflict is imminent
this hate in the brain , destroys the cells like cancer
even experts are stuck with more questions than answers
