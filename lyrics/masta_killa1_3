yo... yo... yo... yo , yo
time to knock 'em out , cut 'em with the glass hand
time to shut 'em down , i'm coming out the badland
oscar the grouch , kid , jumping out the trashcan
the last man that violated , got chopped with the sword
send him a one way express ticket to see the lord
you think we falling off , the beef's internal
all that bullshit we going through , it don't concern you
i'll thermonuclear burn you , you'se a human sacrifice
cuz i be smashing mics with the passion of christ
stay fully loaded , equipped with action devices
kid , stashing these stripes , join the force
honey , take ya flick , lift and point to the boss , soon
as you blink , your coins is tossed
it only takes four bars to get my point accross
and i'm cold as winter frost , on top of the mountains
elijah , was the prophet , along came malcolm
and i'm scalping niggas , taking devil's heads
money generated , niggas taking heavy bread
i was born in a barrel of razor blades
right next door to haze , i used to be afraid
of the devil , as a boy , but now as a grown man
i realized , he is just a toy
a grafted image , of the magnificent splendid
dominant , prominent , islamic
i was here before the dinosaurs , shine and defining law
measure every inch of the earth , combining more
elements and chemicals , fire , space , and minerals
kept devils on the run , like monk - monk the general
appear in a gang attire , slept in a ring of fire
i , got a bigger beat than billy squier
dirty dick dastard' dart , straight out the dungeon
transform on niggas like the rail whip from london
paul bunyan ax tracks , get peeled , caps back
hard to get out , nigga , head like naps
parental advisory , no m.c. is wisin' me
me and the mic , like , ebony and ivory
we go together , like , cheese and cheddar , like
jeans and sweater , like , mo' and better , like
who could take a sun ray , twist it to a rainbow
darts sit upon your head like the kangol
v is for victory , i mastered your trickery
tryna clock like dickory , get smoked like hickory
so please stop the bickery , you can't get rid of me
wu killa bee , from now to infinity
look at this bitch ass , snitch ass , about to get a kicked ass
get mad , get smashed , and get another zip bag of 'dro
for these ho niggas , slow niggas , told niggas
fucking with the coal miner's daughter , she a gold digger
killa , i'm back iller , been realer , chinchilla
coat , ex - crack dealer , cap peeler , dope
uncut coke , cut throat , niggas had enough dough
what up , though ? my nigga , i don't trust no bitches
that's real shit , feel this , vanilla dutch and steel lick
forensics is still tryna figure how i killed it
wu - tang , my crew bang , let our nuts hang
like that piece on a new chain , mami , pop the poontang
your party , find me where the stars be , or probably
walk into the corner store on targhee
smokin' bob marley's , i'm hardly , a nigga to be fucked with
and you tryna 'catch up , but you barely cut the mustard , aight then
just another spine chiller , u - g , rza
m - a - s - t , a - k - illa , m - e - t - h , o - d gorilla , straight from the killa
brownsvillah , do or die bed - stuy
murderer , east terrorist , we clap gun thunderist
land of the iron gods , swords can't live
medina stay warrior , how can i escape the block
from being boxed off , lost in the shuffle of life
living right cost , legendary crime boss
fresh kicks drip in the street , beautiful unique
freestyle , be so wild , fresh out the penal
track it on the pro tools , foul , smooth as blue nile
wave spin , water blend , dart flow , sun glow
kool moe dee roll , gang up on a power show
snoop never love a ho , bang it on in your vehicle slow
you don't know how the god be flipping the style
and keep it so , witty unpredictable
truth or natural , the gods is actual
it's a fact , i was destined , to grab the mic and bless them
