yo , i gotta be around this music , it's therapeutic
the first fresh thoughts of the day is so clear
when i walk , in my head , there's a voice that talks
in my ear i can hear so clear , you think i'm buggin' right ?
out to the west side my killer cali gangstas
ride and get the head right
yo son , i'm on the next flight in
man - formed military arm ready to swarm , get your party on
drinks on the house tonight , ladies lookin' right
atmosphere nice and warm , we backstage like a hundred thieves strong
ghost want the red light on before we get on
an hour's too short to rock , we got a million songs
yo i gotta be around this music , it's therapeutic
like my first blunt of the day to start the movement
i'm sittin' in the room with a view , there's always room for improvement
so i grab my coat and go and prove it
just me against the world , you can find me in the streets
she'll spot me in the lobby , probably find me in the free
tryna put me in a lineup til' i wind up in the beast
that's the belly , how dare they tryna tell me when to eat
with a plate of food barely in my reach
my team shoot dice , we used to shoot skelly in the streets
wear the same pelle - pelle's for a week
but now we livin' life
a such a good life i wish that i could live it twice
i'd probably make the same wiz my wife
it's wu - tang clan , always collect cheddar
proper education , always correct errors
yo , bananas , redman so gorilla
chi - town know i'm pimping the mic , nigga
one hit , and chicks follow me like twitter
crack when i talk , i like the mic steam up
the fiends hit it , chicks swing with it
i'll box niggas in like don king did it
sixteens i write , it's seems so vivid
my notebooks i let the ebay did it
i get dough , bad pair for the sick flow
my weed more greener than lou ferrigno
my right - hand man hand on the pistol
i crack these squares up like nabisco
oh , look at me , i'm lightweight
but with the heart to peel back your white meat
yo wifey want me to make her wifey
hit it , make the bitch hyphy at high speed , doc
