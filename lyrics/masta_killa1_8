uh... musical clever
you know what time it is ( ooh - ahh , meth tical )
yeah... what... ( hey , did you turn my mic down
oh.. my headphone fell off.. damn.. )
death come to those who oppose
knockin' at the door , holding a rose
in plain clothes , when the face ice cold
lock your windows , still i come in when the wind blows
come in slow , suddenly your eyes close
then your body set through your soul , it rose
turn into a black crow and fly into the internal night
that's when i also take flight
i turn into a great falcon
with mighty wings , when they flap , they move mountains
i leap on your back , like a wild fucking monkey
eyes are blood shot red , with a growling tummy
beat your fucking back out , like a gorilla
when i was tore , i figure my way , out the house of mirrors
i show up to a recording session , with no facial expression
i'm just there like i crept in
escape through the east gate , return through the west ends
when the son said , i'm like the westerns beneath the moon light
and the crescent , priest , i have a stance , that's strong
when i perform , i transform , into a sandstorm
leaving one third of the land torn
i'm like mice , i react strange
i'm like a terratrane , i react crazy when the weather change
then the father of a hurricane , handcuff pain
i whip tornados with iron chains
i make volcanos scream out my name
niggas kill me , try'nna escape my wrath
through death , don't you know , i'm crazy muthafucka , i hold my breath..
flicks... sluggy... one time
for your muthafuckin' mind
wu - tang forever , this is just the next chamber , baby
( fish filet , fish filet ) ah , ah - ah - ah
we walking dogs , foot soldiers , fuck you all
guns and roses , play the wall
the final curtain calls every day , all day
we hurtin' ya'll , project hallways is triflin'
public enemy , number one , still fightin'
the power , like tyson
when nothing else work , start biting
swallow up that weak shit , they writing
spit it out , frustrated with the line
hard for me to get it out
intellectual , architect , bomb threat to a vegetable
mr. meth , you can get the left and right testicle
step to the rear , wu - tang on arrival
raised in the ghetto , singin' songs for survival
nothing else matter , suspect chin niggas shatter
clap a mad rapper , red dot beemin' on the blood clot , splatter
university , anniversary of terror
it's now , or it's never
ain't no in betweens in the cold war
can't hold it down , got a thousand that can hold yours
starvin' , pardon me , god , i get a charge
like a human lighting rod , strike back with no regard
for the innocent , harder than the bricks in my tenements
wu - tang , forever and a day , we be killin' it
so patient , they sat there in the aisles and waited
for the testimony , hungry , for a statement from the one and only
thirsty for the ceremony at and , true wu die hard fans
now look how we rock , make a freestyle drop , old school like the wop
my grandaddy used to do this dance called the slop
i keep it hip hop for ya'll , we don't stop
got ladies by the flock , no safety on the glock
stop , look and listen when the semi auto's pop , your neck
mock with the rope , who can match palm
i'm strong as a nuclear bomb , dangerous armed
have you not prepared yourself , you've been warned
gun shot to the informer , killa bee swarm
caught 'em on the corner of lavonia
reported missing , found him in the fetal position
shot twice , armed with the rocket
blind for the target , deaded on arrival
suspenseful , kill or be killed , pass the rifle
