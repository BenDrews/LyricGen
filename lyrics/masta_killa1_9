let's go... yeah... yeah , yeah , yeah...
kaboom , i came through the door
never seen a girl like you before
your eyes , your lips , your hair , your smile
oooh baby , i like your style
heh , i just need a clue , to what a brother like me must do
the touch , the kiss , to hold , me with
just get that thing started
oh no doubt , i'm gon' love you right ( no , no , no , no , no )
woman so just cozy now
there when you need me to hold you tight
never left stressed out , or in doubt ( oh , no , no , no , no )
well welcome to the world of the real mccoy
three times a man , never was a boy
baby , we're here doing nothing
we should be into something
i'm looking at you , you're looking at me
it's all good , girl , burn some weed
no need , you stand around fronting
let's go get into something
i'm crushing on you , you're crushing on me
let's go kick and roll some trees
it's so cool , i moved close to you
i begin to smell your sweet perfume
i smiled , said hi , y'all don't , reply
i like it when they act too fly
heh , all insecurities , could never discourage me
the smooth , finesse , i will , impress
can't help , but to , confess
i came here just to love you right ( no , no , no , no , no )
woman so just cozy now
there when you need me to hold you tight
never left stressed out , or in doubt ( oh , no , no , no , no )
well welcome to the world of the real mccoy
three times a man , never was a boy
aiyo , peace beautiful , here's just a few lines
to let you know i was thinking , look i had a few drinks and
then i lit a bone , thinking bout your skin tone
pretty fat face , with your high cheek bone
i love to hear you moan , you know our phone conversation is grown
you sayin' " daddy come home " , i'm all alone
here staring at your picture , kinda hating , i miss ya
i soon come kiss ya pain and make it better
you dressed with my sweater , for the scent of your man
while i'm out hustlin' , black gloves on my hand
my mind pan , pictures you in front of the fan
i know it's been a little while since you felt my embrace
you miss daddy taste , you pace back and forth
in your vicky thong lace , the anticipation is great
you can't erase , the thought of my arrival
feel the tingle , it's the sensation
i be rubbing that , holding that , loving that
girl , i know you like it like that
i'm looking at you , you're looking at me
it's all good , girl , burn some weed
i be loving that , holding that , squeezing that
girl , what you gon' do ?
i'm looking at you , you're looking at me
it's all good , girl , burn some weed
