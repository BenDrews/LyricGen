you think you’re the new sexy
in a white mercedes that bends me to the grave
you make casual messy
and all materials possess you like a slave
you’re custom made
don’t take this swim for more than it is
it’s one night one night one night
chew my love
under your tongue
like it’s your bubblegum
you’re blowing bubbles
‘till the taste is gone
are you coming over for the night
just one night one night one night
chew my love
under your tongue
like it’s your bubblegum
just spit me out
when it becomes more than fun
cause i’m coming over for the night
just one night one night one night
conversation is violent
baby you’re too digital
8 bit dated physical
but keep me under your ceiling
cause your concrete’s cheapening
crumbling like greece on me , oh no
don’t take this swim for more than it is
it’s one night one night one night
chew my love
under your tongue
like it’s your bubblegum
you’re blowing bubbles
‘till the taste is gone
are you coming over for the night
just one night one night one night
chew my love
under your tongue
like it’s your bubblegum
just spit me out
when it becomes more than fun
cause i’m coming over for the night
just one night one night one night
now i’ll pull you in close
it's the sweetest sour high
when you promise not to try
if i promise that ill lie
we could drink the punch for this one last time
just one more last time
chew my love
under your tongue
like it’s your bubblegum
you’re blowing bubbles
‘till the taste is gone
are you coming over for the night
just one night one night one night
chew my love
under your tongue
like it’s your bubblegum
just spit me out
when it becomes more than fun
cause i’m coming over for the night
just one night one night one night
one night one night one night
one night
just spit me out when it becomes more than fun
