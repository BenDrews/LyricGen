i can't keep faking it
i smile real wide with a mouth of diamonds
but the shine is counterfeit
when we're dressed in white , we're in halloween outfits
obsessed with protecting you
your trigger's worth dreaming , a price possession
i spend hours perfecting you
'til you're bigger than me on my knee's reflection , praying
dear ana , i can't live without you
but it's killing me to keep you alive
and dear ana , i'm afraid to out you
i know your secrets and you know mine
and you have carried me away
for too long
you have carried me away
now i'm gone
now i'm gone
i know i keep saying it
that tomorrow's last time , we'll be last and final
and i keep engraving it
when i climb the pearl gates , i recite your bible
obsessed with believing you
you're a sweet 16 , blowing out my candles
and i'm tired of needing you
going dizzy with dreams that evolve and cancel
dear ana , i can't live without you
but it's killing me to keep you alive
and dear ana , i'm afraid to out you
i know your secrets and you know mine
and you have carried me away
for too long
you have carried me away
now i'm gone
now i'm gone
you're my best friend , you're my weakness
you're my angel , yoou're my demons
you're my virgin in a black dress
i'm on my knees again for you
dear ana , i can't live without you
but it's killing me to keep you alive
and dear ana , i'm afraid to out you
i know your secrets and you know mine
and you have carried me away
for too long
you have carried me away
now i'm gone
dear ana , now i'm gone
dear ana
dear ana
dear ana , i can't live without you
dear ana
dear ana
dear ana , i can't live without you
