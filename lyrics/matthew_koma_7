you look like sundays with my ex
eating breakfast with your arms across your chest
like a cross you were my trust around her neck til it hung her
my baby she was clinically obsessed
our identity was physical but less
every now and then her noise inside my head re - entered
she said i remember loving you
all of the good shit and all the bad shit too
i remember hating you
for all the right things you never tried to do
i remember needing you
call me an addict , to your elastic moods
i'm packing every memory that we made in a suitcase
you're on a train i used to wreck
with the bullets of the least of my respect
i wish there was a shot i could regret but there isn't
yea there were tongue
i spoke in heat
that i never meant to say , or meant to mean
in the shop or when i see her in my sleep in visions
she said i remember loving you
all of the good shit and all the bad shit too
i remember hating you
for all the right things you never tried to do
i remember needing you
call me an addict , to your elastic moods
i'm packing every memory that we made in a suitcase
i know you hate it when i say i'm sorry
but i'm sorry ohh ohh
she said i remember loving you
all of the good shit and all the bad shit too
i remember hating you
for all ? the right things you never tried to do
i remember needing you
call me an addict , to your elastic moods
i'm packing every memory that we made in a suitcase
you look like sundays with my ex
eating breakfast with your arms across your chest
like a cross you were my trust around her neck til it hung her
