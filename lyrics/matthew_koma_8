think of me when your world seems to fall apart
under the weight of a heavy heart
it’s so material , criminal , what we put up on a pedestal
need a spark to start a fire
don’t be afraid of a chance for a miracle
scare it away being cynical
step into open skies , close your eyes
jump into something you don’t recognize
just reach your arms out wide
cut me loose , my parachute won’t let me fly
i’ll survive cuz we got love
summer days will fade away and pass us by
but we’ll survive cuz we got love
think of what we had , we got love
and it’s all we had , we got love
think of what we had , we got love
i’ll be the voice when the whispers get too loud
your home base and the king that keeps you crowned
your breath when you’re choking on your words
your sex your right turn
when you’re ready to start , lean on my heart baby
close your eyes just reach your arms out wide
cut me loose , my parachute won’t let me fly
i’ll survive cuz we got love
summer days will fade away and pass us by
but we’ll survive cuz we got love
think of what we had , we got love
and it’s all we had , we got love
think of what we had , we got love
don ‘t need a tune with a view on the westside
just wanna wake up at your side
cuz when you know it , you know it
in the blink of a moment
it’s like i‘m , like i‘m , like i’m falling for the first time
cut me loose , my parachute won’t let me fly
i’ll survive cuz we got love
summer days will fade away and pass us by
but we’ll survive cuz we got love
think of what we had , we got love
and it’s all we had , we got love
think of what we had , we got love
