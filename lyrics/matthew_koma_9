the sun hits like a
bullet of faith
and then suddenly
i'm wild awake
a fake bliss
of apologies made
was an enemy
with no escape
my hands were tied
but now they're mine
to grab on to desire
and run away
these will be the years
these will be the years
the lights will all appear
these will be the years
years...
these will be the years
years...
grey dust now
sparkling gold and
the best is
yet to unfold
white heat finding
comfort in cold
and the heart was
found in her soul
her hands were tied
but now they're mine
to grab on
and wherever you go
i'll go
these will be the years
these will be the years
the lights will all appear
these will be the years
( years... )
these will be the years
these will be the years
these will be the years
the lights will all appear
these will be the years
