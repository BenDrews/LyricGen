love , you left me haunted
love , i’m just a shadow now
dark in the night
dark in the day
the messages won't go away
love , you left me madness
turn me ( in ) to a monster now
( let the light in )
love , i think i’m dying
love , the monster’s got me now
love , i think i’m dying
love , the shadow's all around
lost in years
lost in the days
lost , and it just won’t go away
let the light in
let the light in
love , i feel you near me
love is no more shadow now
love , i feel you near me
love is no more monster now
