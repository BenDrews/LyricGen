sometimes we go to bed as lovers
sometimes we go to bed as friends
if you ask me , it doesn't matter
cause in the end , i'm still content
i stay up on the higher level
when my shit gets rough , i charge it to the game
i charge it to the game
and i don't wanna talk it out if you don't wanna talk about it
sometimes you just gotta take a hit and charge it to the game
the player gets played , you're gonna have to pay
and when they hold a gun to your head
and askin' 'bout your last words said
say " charge it to the game "
say " charge it to the game "
together , we'll go to the grave
going out with a bang
charge it to the game
charge it to the game
believe the universe is balanced on a scale of good and bad
some people see it as a challenge , hustling with the struggles they have
i couldn't say that i'm an angel cause i don't have my wings , i don't have my wings
we don't have to talk it out , there's nothing left to talk about
sometimes we all gotta take a hit ; there's nothing you can say
charge it to the game when you can't catch a break
and when they hold a gun to your head
and askin' 'bout your last words said
say " charge it to the game "
say " charge it to the game "
together , we'll go to the grave
going out with a bang
charge it to the game
charge it to the game
charge it to the game when you wanna get out the system
charge it to the game when you gotta hit and quit 'em
charge it to the game when your name gets dropped
got no money and you got no job
oh , oh , oh , oh ( charge it to the game
oh , oh , oh ( charge it , charge it , charge it to the game )
and when they hold a gun to your head
and askin' 'bout your last words said
say " charge it to the game "
say " charge it to the game "
together , we'll go to the grave
going out with a bang
charge it to the game
charge it to the game
na na na , na - na na na na
charge it to the game , charge it to the game
na na na , na - na na na na
charge it to the game , charge it to the game
