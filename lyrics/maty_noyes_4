a little bit wrong than you like it
a little too broke to buy it
a little too great to hide it
i'm a little bit wrong
( i'm a little bit wrong )
but i've been gone back from the dead
and you do really understand
never in love , love despairs
say you're with me , say you're with me
but i'm not hurt by what she said
may i live life from their hands
heart to heart , color me red
color me red , color me red
all across the world
all the boys and girls
if you feel the noise
sing it , sing it along
a little bit wrong than you like it
a little too broke to buy it
a little too great to hide it
i'm a little bit wrong
a little too bent to fix it
a little jam on that biscuit
lipstick's like love , i'll kiss it
i'm a little bit wrong
( i'm a little bit wrong )
oh , my body has feng shui
i'm not just a pretty face
every piece in perfect place
pick your places , work your faces
can't disguise a masterpiece
people like what people see
here i am just being me
they can taste it , just can't make it
all across the world
all the boys and girls
if you feel the noise
sing it , sing it along
a little bit wrong than you like it
a little too broke to buy it
a little too great to hide it
i'm little bit wrong
a little too bent to fix it
a little jam on that biscuit
lipstick's like love , i'll kiss it
i'm a little bit wrong
