and i wanna say what's on my mind
and you didn't like what i'm saying
i say it a million times , yeah
i like being with you
i'm tired of hiding in your room
we've been holding back for way too long
wish the beats are done
but i'm swimming in your pool
are you tired of watching from your room
you always wanna meet me there
i swear i'll drag you down the stairs
well if you want me , take me where
everyone sees but we don't care
i'm rollin' with you
wherever i go , whatever i do
that's what i choose
just me and you
and i know it doesn't matter where we go
as long as we're together
we'll be loving when they say that nothing lasts forever
you know we can lose
they'll say what they want but i'm rollin' with you
cause i just wanna be with you
oh girl i think you know ( i know ) that you're just my type ( yes )
and i swear we can get through this
and you get me through the night
oh you , you're just swimming in my pool
and i need a better few
you feel like sunlight on my skin
i'll take my time and breathe you in
with you the summer never ends
they tell a story , we just begin
i'm rollin' with you
wherever i go , whatever i do
that's what i choose
just me and you
and i know it doesn't matter where we go
as long as we're together
we'll be loving when they say that nothing lasts forever
you know we can lose
they'll say what they want but i'm rollin' with you
you , i'm rollin' with , rollin' with you , rollin' with you
you , i'm rollin' with , rollin' with you , rollin' with you
you feel like sunlight on my skin
i'll take my time and breathe you in
with you the summer never ends
they tell a story , we just begin
i'm rollin' with you
wherever i go , whatever i do
that's what i choose
just me and you
and i know it doesn't matter where we go
as long as we're together
we'll be loving when they say that nothing lasts forever
you know we can lose
they'll say what they want but i'm rollin' with you
you , i'm rollin' with , rollin' with you , rollin' with you
you , i'm rollin' with , rollin' with you , rollin' with you
they'll say what they want but i'm rollin' with you
