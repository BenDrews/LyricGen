no not everyone is like me
thank god , thank god
and if they were , we'd all be fighting
nah nah , nah nah
and all the fighting it turns to kissing
kissing the reminiscing , always missing
looking back on the good times
only thing that we're missing
is that we never listen to each other
while we're tryna live that good life
takes one to love one
takes one to love one
i will make you go
we don't go there
why are you tryna look so perfect ?
missed our old days
i feel the best when i'll just leave it
oh dear , that's just me
now all the babies with daddy issues
getting with momma issues , blowing tissues
cause they can never last long
who really makes decisions ?
who get left only wishing doing dishes ?
can't we just all get along ?
takes one to love one
takes one to love one
i will make you go
we don't go there
i will make you go
we don't...
takes one to love one
takes one
takes one to love one
takes one
takes one to love one
takes one
takes one to love one
i will make you go
we don't go there
i will make you go
we don't go there
i will make you go
we don't...
