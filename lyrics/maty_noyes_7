i think i'm falling
i think i'm falling
out of love with you
my stomach's turning
my eyes are watering
i don't know what to do
well i keep tryna wait , oh wait
it out and ignore the truth
but i think it's time to say , oh say
say goodbye to you
i think i'm falling out of love , oh , oh
falling out of love with you
i think i'm falling out of love , oh , oh
falling out of love with you
oh - oh - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh
oh - oh - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh , oh
oh - oh - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh
oh - oh - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh , oh
want me to fix you
want me to fix you
i don't know what to do
i tried to love you
i tried to kiss you
i couldn't heal your wounds
well if you'd only change , oh change
but then you won't be you
i guess i'll be on my way , oh way
and this was all i knew
i think i'm falling out of love , oh , oh
falling out of love with you
i think i'm falling out of love , oh , oh
falling out of love with you
oh - oh - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh
oh - oh - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh , oh
oh - oh - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh
oh - oh - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh , oh
and when i try to say your name
the words don't sound the same
so you're feeling all this pain
well , i don't feel a thing
oh - oh - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh , oh
falling out of love with you
i think i'm falling out of love , oh , oh
falling out of love with you
i think i'm falling out of love , oh , oh
falling out of love with you
oh - oh - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh
oh - oh - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh , oh
oh - oh - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh
oh - oh - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh , oh
i think i'm falling
i think i'm falling
out of love with you
