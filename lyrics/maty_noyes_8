we're wide awake in the dead of the night
either making some love or getting into a fight
but it's fine , it's alright
i always make it out alive , yeah , yeah
don't let me go ; they're trying to take me away
even if they did , you'd better find a way to escape
cause you're mine , yeah , you're mine
and there's only so much time we got together , ooh
and there's only so much time we got together , ooh
and don't try to control my feelings
you can't just change my life
i've got his heart in my pocket and he's got mine
i don't care what they say ; you balance anyway
if what they say is the truth , then you're my best mistake
what do they really know about us ?
can't tell me who to love
can't , can't , c - c - can't , can't tell me who to love
can't , can't , c - c - can't , can't tell me who to love
everyone's got an opinion ; they've got something to say
so we're packing up the car and heading out to la
right away , right away
cause all they want to do is hate , hate , hate
oh , guess what ? he makes me happy
that's all you need to know
so what ? i love him crazy
just... just let it go
i don't care what they say ; you balance anyway
if what they say is the truth , then you're my best mistake
they're trying to live my life
we're gonna make it out alive
it's you and me at the end of every single day
sorry , not sorry , it's always gonna be this way
what do they really know about us ?
can't tell me who to love
can't , can't , c - c - can't , can't tell me who to love
can't , can't , c - c - can't , can't tell me who to love
they don't know , they don't know , they don't know , they don't know
they don't know what we have
they don't know , they don't know , they don't know , they don't know
they don't know what we have
they don't know , they don't know , they don't know , oh
they don't know what we have
i don't care what they say ; you balance anyway
if what they say is the truth , then you're my best mistake
they're trying to live my life
we're gonna make it out alive
it's you and me at the end of every single day
sorry , not sorry , it's always gonna be this way
what do they really know about us ?
can't tell me who to love
can't , can't , c - c - can't , can't tell me who to love
can't , can't , c - c - can't , can't tell me who to love
