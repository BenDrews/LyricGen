section 4
division of labour in manufacture , and division
of labour in society
______________________________________________________
we first considered the origin of manufacture , then its simple elements , then the detail labourer and his implements , and finally , the totality of the mechanism. we shall now lightly touch upon the relation between the division of labour in manufacture , and the social division of labour , which forms the foundation of all production of commodities.
the rules of the guilds , as i have said before , by limiting most strictly the number of apprentices and journeymen that a single master could employ , prevented him from becoming a capitalist. moreover , he could not employ his journeymen in many other handicrafts than the one in which he was a master. the guilds zealously repelled every encroachment by the capital of merchants , the only form of free capital with which they came in contact. a merchant could buy every kind of commodity , but labour as a commodity he could not buy. he existed only on sufferance , as a dealer in the products of the handicrafts. if circumstances called for a further division of labour , the existing guilds split themselves up into varieties , or founded new guilds by the side of the old ones ; all this , however , without concentrating various handicrafts in a single workshop. hence , the guild organisation , however much it may have contributed by separating , isolating , and perfecting the handicrafts , to create the material conditions for the existence of manufacture , excluded division of labour in the workshop. on the whole , the labourer and his means of production remained closely united , like the snail with its shell , and thus there was wanting the principal basis of manufacture , the separation of the labourer from his means of production , and the conversion of these means into capital.
while division of labour in society at large , whether such division be brought about or not by exchange of commodities , is common to economic formations of society the most diverse , division of labour in the workshop , as practised by manufacture , is a special creation of the capitalist mode of production alone.

27. sir james steuart is the economist who has handled this subject best. how little his book , which appeared ten years before the “wealth of nations , ” is known , even at the present time , may be judged from the fact that the admirers of malthus do not even know that the first edition of the latter’s work on population contains , except in the purely declamatory part , very little but extracts from steuart , and in a less degree , from wallace and townsend.
28. “there is a certain density of population which is convenient , both for social intercourse , and for that combination of powers by which the produce of labour is increased.” ( james mill , l.c. , p. 50. ) “as the number of labourers increases , the productive power of society augments in the compound ratio of that increase , multiplied by the effects of the division of labour.” ( th. hodgskin , l.c. , pp. 125 , 126. )
29. in consequence of the great demand for cotton after 1861 , the production of cotton , in some thickly populated districts of india , was extended at the expense of rice cultivation. in consequence there arose local famines , the defective means of communication not permitting the failure of rice in one district to be compensated by importation from another.
30. thus the fabrication of shuttles formed as early as the 17th century , a special branch of industry in holland.
31. whether the woollen manufacture of england is not divided into several parts or branches appropriated to particular places , where they are only or principally manufactured ; fine cloths in somersetshire , coarse in yorkshire , long ells at exeter , soies at sudbury , crapes at norwich , linseys at kendal , blankets at whitney , and so forth.” ( berkeley : “the querist , ” 1751 , § 520. )

33. in manufacture proper , he says , the division of labour appears to be greater , because “those employed in every different branch of the work can often be collected into the same workhouse , and placed at once under the view of the spectator. in those great manufactures , ( ! ) on the contrary , which are destined to supply the great wants of the great body of the people , every different branch of the work employs so great a number of workmen , that it is impossible to collect them all into the same workhouse ... the division is not near so obvious.” ( a. smith : “wealth of nations , ” bk. i , ch. i. ) the celebrated passage in the same chapter that begins with the words , “observe the accommodation of the most common artificer or day - labourer in a civilised and thriving country , ” &c. , and then proceeds to depict what an enormous number and variety of industries contribute to the satisfaction of the wants of an ordinary labourer , is copied almost word for word from b. de mandeville’s remarks to his “fable of the bees , or private vices , publick benefits.” ( first ed. , without the remarks , 1706 ; with the remarks , 1714. )
34. “there is no longer anything which we can call the natural reward of individual labour. each labourer produces only some part of a whole , and each part , having no value or utility in itself , there is nothing on which the labourer can seize , and say : it is my product , this i will keep to myself.” ( “labour defended against the claims of capital.” lond. , 1825 , p. 25. ) the author of this admirable work is the th. hodgskin i have already cited.
35. this distinction between division of labour in society and in manufacture , was practically illustrated to the yankees. one of the new taxes devised at washington during the civil war , was the duty of 6% “on all industrial products.” question : what is an industrial product ? answer of the legislature : a thing is produced “when it is made , ” and it is made when it is ready for sale. now , for one example out of many. the new york and philadelphia manufacturers had previously been in the habit of “making” umbrellas with all their belongings. but since an umbrella is a mixtum compositum of very heterogeneous parts , by degrees these parts became the products of various separate industries , carried on independently in different places. they entered as separate commodities into the umbrella manufactory , where they were fitted together. the yankees have given to articles thus fitted together , the name of “assembled articles , ” a name they deserve , for being an assemblage of taxes. thus the umbrella “assembles , ” first , 6% on the price of each of its elements , and a further 6% on its own total price.

38. “under this simple form ... the inhabitants of the country have lived from time immemorial. the boundaries of the villages have been but seldom altered ; and though the villages themselves have been sometimes injured , and even desolated by war , famine , and disease , the same name , the same limits , the same interests , and even the same families , have continued for ages. the inhabitants give themselves no trouble about the breaking up and division of kingdoms ; while the village remains entire , they care not to what power it is transferred , or to what sovereign it devolves ; its internal economy remains unchanged.” ( th. stamford raffles , late lieut. gov. of java : “the history of java.” lond. , 1817 , vol. i. , p. 285. )
