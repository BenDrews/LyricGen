go on , it's not your fight ! )
it's not yours nigga , fall back
i'm about to blow something out here
straight up , yeah , this is a family thing
we gon' handle our business and shit
these muthafuckas know not to come around here like that
this is real shit , real talk
four different niggas , with four different aspects , nigga
this is family shit
who the fuck said family ain't family no more , nigga ?
this is tight shit , tighter than white in ya wallet
yo , i'm talking bags of heavy coke , bracelets on every men
innocent dope pushers , over night king pins
indeed , we smack niggas up for their cheese
throw bleach in yo face , got beef , let it be chuck
the streets don't know my peeps
jumpin' out of ups trucks , blowing niggas off they feet
with four - four gloves , rims spinning , tippin' on fo - fo's
my mouth be worth millions , something like paul wall's
ladies look out ; they ain't thugs , they homo's
the film look hyper , when i clap 'em in slo mo'
ya'll still paying the mob ? we whip niggas out like waffle batter
theodore ancient with dart , flossin' them diamonds
discussing our hits over a glass of scotch
baywatch bitches that ski , take turns when they hand us the twat
think not , we still run the trains , til the condom pop
on the low , we still fucking them cops
pretty things from all precints , friday nights , we holding they glocks
this is family , nigga , niggas can't stand me
next up , my little man , i hand you the jammy
you know the fam , what it is , it is what it is
s.i.n.y. , where the animals live
ass bet , niggas run in yo cribs
i don't care if you blast for the cash , then scramble yo wig
i'm like " damn , what a wonderful kid "
i could do what i want , doing dirt , not serving a bid
you know a real fam handle they biz , everybody get searched
from the grandpops , down to the kids
and my time , i'm officially here , tell ya man
go and start up ya car , start shifting the gears
sun god got the pits for his ears , cuz niggas is scared
hoping i don't let it blow in they ribs
i said hot , niggas get robbed non stop
once the gun cock , niggas strip down to they socks
and my fam at the tippity top , i won't stop
believe it or not , you and ya man is close targets
juks everything , dice games , mini markets
fam gon' spark it , i'mma take whatever's in the pockets
mostly the cash and the wallet , slide off the jewels
cuz you shining , begets and the diamonds
never deny niggas with iron... yo !
aiyo , chillin' with the ceasar crew
we can smoke , all in the halls
it's how many niggas with guns , got 'em on
all tip top , cling to the fullest , mad bullets
this is a hobby , the lobby where they clap yo hoods
get the paper , word to everything , we a acre up
barbequin' like a mutt , we ain't taking nothing
a high tech extremist , gatorade , paid ya boy some money
to lay up on the low , swinging beamers
i need to be an actor , but instead , i'd rather be in hempstead
all of my bread came from crack barbers and shoppers
so much beef in these whoppers
guns that'll knock out floors and hit choppers
what ? what ? the family remains , cuz it's grain
it's automatic , i live it and i claim it
it's real , come around here , you bought here
yo , lay that half tape , then you will get wrapped real quick
aiyo , we hug the block on president's day
swinging all year round , gettin' that money the american way
might run up in yo wedding , grab the reverand and spray
and let the shots for whatever they may
this is family , nigga , minus the mob size
the resurrection of toney starks & trife dies' , starring in part 5
niggas'll rather die when they're pride's in question
try'nna play hero , getting stuck for they prized possessions
look you staring in the eyes of oppression , that's why i ride with protection
extended clips , super sizing my weapons
five eleven , keep the heat tucked
that'll burn a hole thru ya stomach like acid reflux
get buried in ya cheap tux'
we make it hard for you niggas to keep up
been thru a hundred towns , and running , beating the streets up
come up north in new york , down in miami , pumping
at a table , breaking bread like a family
florida , where we follow the code of the streets and
breaking the beats and , we taking the eats
never the least , we invading the streets
shaking the beast , we familiar for life
we don't run , we grab knives , my double edged spit life
my dogs is real tight , shooting the dice
some of my fam might snatch ya ice
got family that go to church , come back like you don't work
got family that'll set you up , got family that chill , wanna spark the dutch
wizard my fam , that stuck you up , i got fam that'll fuck you up
chop you up , put your body in the back of the truck
osama island , we been wilding , see the violence
we display talent , respect balance , nigga , shaolin
