y'all niggas better be
ready for a hostile takeover , label makeovers , dog your days over
... hold on , man...
y'all niggas better be
ready for a hostile takeover , label makeovers , your days over
we here now , watch the turn of events
it's " star time " welcome ladies and gents
i'm chaundon your host , i'm nice , gimme a few seconds to boast
gimme a beat and a rapper to roast
these niggas break faster than grits eggs and a side order of toast
damn shame my mixtape is soundin' better than most
bigger names' lp's hire me as your ghost
cause my path is the road to success
y'all ain't nice enough to draw your own map , here trace my steps
the footprints in the sand are mine
y'all are tired , i'mma carry hip hop until the end of time
and i'll shine
if you didn't know bet you gon' know now
we got that sound to break your ground
so when you hear that crowd go
{cheers}
you know that we are
if you didn't know bet you gon' know now
