all i do is win , win , win , no matter what
got money on my mind i can never get enough
whenever me and khaled do the remix everybody's hands go up
and they stay there
and they stay yea
and they stay there
up , down , up , down , up , down
cause all i do is win , win , win
and if you going in put your hands in the air make em stay there
sittin' on the top floor , what you think i'm hot for
every summer drop more , hits to make my stock go , up
them hands go , up ; them fans go , up
i'm number one in this bitch and i'ma , stay there
we the best of the best , grind while you haters just sleep
i'm yellin' " free weezy " , i rep the heart of the streets
who hotter than me , i'm wearin' the crown
we can't stop , won't stop ; go hate on me now
i could never get enough when it come to gettin' fetti
niggas ain't ready for my ferrari scaglietti
mario andretti , money comin' fast
my honeycomb hideout is made of all glass
i could never be a racist , wake up every morning just to count white faces
neo in the matrix , glorious as morpheus
employed all warriors , i'm mean as a scorpion , dr. kevorkian
everytime i come you gotta know a nigga comin'
get a lot of money when i'm in the buildin'
uh - huh , okay
niggas know i got you when i hit you with the pitter - patter
whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter - chatter
niggas know there ain't nobody better , better , better , better !
i watch a lot of niggas when i'm in the cut
so sick when i come and hit 'em in the gut
you will crown me king ( no matter what ! )
( kill 'em ! )
ok , let's shine my friend
get up on my grind again
some niggas will be happy that i chose to rhyme with them cause
her heart racing like she snort cocaine
i got a billion reasons you should know my whole name
got the most paper mr. new york times
i'm a natural born winner nigga new york mines
everybody getting money but i cop the first six
now i run the game so i toss the first pitch
yea , i'll let you wife her but she still my first bitch
if it's less then nine digits nigga , that ain't fuckin' rich mother fucker
ayo , all i do is win , ain't that the reason that you really mad
undisputed hailing all the way from trinidad
i ain't mad ma , see you on your bummy swag
i'm in that money green jag , lot of money bags
i told khaled you the best but i'm the bestest
better run for cover if your name is on my checklist
you could talk slick , all the way down to the welfare
ask the irs bitch , i'm paying for your health care
i'ma make this here official , let me clear some issues
first off i am not for britney spears initials
thats no b - s , at your re - quest
lean back you and your crew , fat joe , t - s
yea it's young funeral , all black on me
so act like summers over and fall back homey
winnin' is all i do , i'll answer all of you
but y'all ain't sayin' shit , like prank callers do
it's already proven , i got them birds movin'
all i do is win , i'm allergic to losin'
yellow gold cuban , nine mil ruger
i'll show you what to do with em
finish em , i'm through with em
they gon have to jump me , it's gon take a few of em
they don't want no problems , they might end up suing em
disassociate yourself , have nothing to do with em
we already got a jet , we tryna get two of em
just blew trial , crack lobsters little italy
your wife she a screamer yellin' slow down joe , you killin' me
beat her like a prize fight mommy i’m a rude boy
you just hit the power ball , everyday a new toy
nigga it’s a stick up , a motherfuckin' robbery
i done did some things that have haitian jack proud of me
ridin' through harlem me and jeezy pardon me
puffy surfin' on the hood for niggas that keep doubtin' me
