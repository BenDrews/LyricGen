oh yes this is special
this is direct from what we call
the funk house
this is a tony dofat one
know what i'm sayin
and this is how it's done
i did good in my hood as a youngsta
the heavster was never a punkster
no sir no ma'am
hot damn , me and michael jackson jammed
i dug soul train , not american bandstand
the bigger nigga is back
and i'm on the right track
as a matter of fact , i'm all that
so ring around the rosie , oopsy - daisy
topsy turvy , you never heard of me
you don't deserve me
fly like an eagle , drive like a bmw
you never knew i could bring trouble to
a cordless you can't afford this
don't get aboard this flavor
unless you got the fever flavor for a pringle
could be a single
let me see you mingle jingle dangle
sammy davis jr. was mr. bojangles
( here is something you can't understand )
tell me y'all , who's the man ?
who's the man ? ( the heavster )
( " time keeps on slipping... " )
who's the man ? ( the heavster )
( " time keeps on slipping... " )
who's the man ? ( the heavster )
( " time keeps on slipping... " )
who's the man ? ( the heavster )
( " time keeps on slipping... " )
yes , too many brothers be fakin moves
and frontin' grooves
peace to all the brothers on the block
drinkin' and passin' brews
money tried to flip but he got flopped
said it was his corner
let him know his corner's on my block
i know your fantasy
don't stay , i ain't jodeci
you didn't notice me
but now you see me in a magazine
on your tv screen
on the radio , live in stereo , looking clean
all of a sudden i'm attractive
i'm handsome , i'm gorgeous
but back in the day you used to say
" you can't afford this... "
i wreck shops and got props
from new york to cali
i'm big willie , you silly sally from the valley
ain't nuttin' changed
wait a minute , i'm a liar
the crib is definitely doper and the girls a lot flyer
( here is something you can't understand )
so tell me y'all , who's the man ?
who's the man ?
( the heavster )
who's the man ?
( the heavster )
who's the man ?
( the heavster )
who's the man ?
who's the man ?
yes , who's the man ?
who's the man ?
like i said , this here , is official
back in the day i used to punch clocks
now i'm drippin props
and counting loot , and shootin hoops
and looking cute
in tailored suits
made for the overweight lover
undercover , over cover
you know my m.o
i do damo on the stage show
i'm gettin' paid by the pound and i got mad flow
flip flop who's the bigger one
quick to figure
one , two , 3 - 2 - 1 ( ah ! )
keep a pen and a pad on stash
now i flow for dough , and i rhyme for cash
i'm glad to say goodnight to johnny carson
and brother wear you rubber
before you catch the magic in your johnson
honey dips , money grips
i know the difference cause i learned tricks in the ghetto mix
( here is something you can't understand )
so tell me y'all , who's the man ?
who's the man
( time keeps on slipping )
who's the man
( time keeps on slipping )
who's the man
( time keeps on slipping )
who's the man
( time keeps on slipping )
everything here , is phat
know what i'm sayin ?
don't take it the wrong way
but i'm lettin you know
for the last time
this here is official
respect
who's the man
( time keeps on slipping )
who's the man
( time keeps on slipping )
