time and time again , i been trying to
get a little closer , but you won't let it
i'm like a fluzy i'm choosy and i don't fall for tricks
cause guys be running games , like the new york nicks
with your baby , baby talk , and your " excuse me miss "
i thought that we could get together , and maybe we can ...
look , we're not the two , and i'm not the one
so if ya got some thought of taking me to bed
kill that ! and get a five dollar crack - head
there's just certain things you don't understand baby :
every woman wants to be treated like a lady
i'm just tryna put it , so i can make something happen
you just turned me off by the way that you was gabbling
a bit of change for a woman , that's what i'm not having
you only get lots of pain and sorrow
so for at least until tomorrow
friend. i'm never gonna fall in love again
but getting back to the topic of convo
in my book hone , you are a no - no
i don't sell drugs and i ain't with the wack track
i'm cool and calm , my phone is mine
you don't see me snatching taste , and acting wild
excuse me miss , i think you better get with this
