keo : my best friend that wrote metro , rtw , great graffiti artist - his father was ron carter , the bass player. his name was miles carter. and i think he was responsible for introducing a lot of the older jazz heads to hip hop , because originally there was beef. the old jazz dudes were like " yo , they're stealing our records " . and that's when stetsa made that response record. and i think miles was the one that like , got that whole jazzmatazz thing rolling , introducing his father to q - tip and low end theory and all of that. he's been out in paris with john lun doing incredible art. just everyone there was a fucking star.
