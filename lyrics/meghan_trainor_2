i found myself dreaming in silver and gold
like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
we were walking on moonlight , and you pulled me close
split second and you disappeared and then i was all alone
i woke up in tears , with you by my side
a breath of relief , and i realized
no , we're not promised tomorrow
so i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna hold you , like i'm saying goodbye
wherever we're standing , i won't take you for granted
cause we'll never know when
when we'll run out of time
so i'm gonna love you , like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna love you , like i'm gonna lose you
in the blink of an eye , just a whisper of smoke
you could lose everything , the truth is you never know
so i'll kiss you longer baby , any chance that i get
i'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret
so let's take our time to say what we want
use what we got before it's all gone
no , we're not promised tomorrow
so i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna hold you , like i'm saying goodbye
wherever we're standing , i won't take you for granted
cause we'll never know when
when we'll run out of time
so i'm gonna love you , like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna love you , like i'm gonna lose you
so i'm gonna love you
like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna love you
like i'm gonna lose you
so i'm gonna love you like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna hold you , like i'm saying goodbye
wherever we're standing , i won't take you for granted
cause we'll never know when
when we'll run out of time
so i'm gonna love you , like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna love you , like i'm gonna lose you
so i'm gonna love you
like i'm gonna lose you
i'm gonna love you
like i'm gonna lose you
