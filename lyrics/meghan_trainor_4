ow !
who's that sexy thang i see over there ?
that's me , standin' in the mirror
what's that icy thang hangin' 'round my neck ?
that's gold , show me some respect ( oh ah )
i thank god every day ( uh huh )
that i woke up feelin' this way ( uh huh )
and i can't help lovin' myself
and i don't need nobody else , nuh uh
if i was you , i'd wanna be me too
i'd wanna be me too
i'd wanna be me too
if i was you , i'd wanna be me too
i'd wanna be me too
i'd wanna be me too
i walk in like a dime piece
i go straight to vip
i never pay for my drinks
my entourage behind me
my life's a movie , tom cruise
so bless me , baby , achoo
and even if they tried to
they can't do it like i do
i thank god every day ( uh huh )
that i woke up feelin' this way ( uh huh )
and i can't help lovin' myself
and i don't need nobody else , nuh uh
if i was you , i'd wanna be me too

if i was you , i'd wanna be me too
i'd wanna be me too
