finally blew up in my face
crash and burned to pieces
you got what you want from me
i gave you what you needed
i was warned , but fooled by charm
and you deserve to be alone
and i deserve better , better than you
i deserve better , better than you , i deserve better
tell 'em what they already know , i deserve better
tell 'em what they already know , i deserve better
i used to cry to all my friends
but they would say , " i told ya "
finally , i can breathe again
the weight is off my shoulders
i was warned , but fooled by charm
and you , you deserve to be alone
and i deserve better , better than you
i deserve better , better than you , i deserve better
tell 'em what they already know , i deserve better
tell 'em what they already know , i deserve better
let's talk about the word " deserve "
or talk 'bout the world deserves : a queen ( you queen )
let's talk about that four letter word ( love )
i think you deserve a king
i think you deserve the world and everything in it
and i try to go get it to show you i meant it when i
tell you i'm sorry , tomorrow i promise that i
try to be better , i'll do whatever for mine
and i ain't tryna be your friend's friends
or your quote - unquote " fake friends " , that's why i hate friends
i'd rather see you laugh than see you cry
i'd rather see you leave than tell a lie
and you ain't gotta say it , you deserve better
i deserve better , better than you
i deserve better , better than you , i deserve better
tell 'em what they already know , i deserve better
tell 'em what they already know , i deserve better
