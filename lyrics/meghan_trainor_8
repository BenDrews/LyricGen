oh , oh , oh
oh - oh - oh - oh
why you gotta hug me
like that every time you see me ?
why you always making me laugh
swear you're catching feelings
i loved you from the start
so it breaks my heart
when you say i'm just a friend to you
'cause friends don't do the things we do
everybody knows you love me too
tryna be careful with the words i use
i'll say it cause i'm dying to
i'm so much more than just a friend to you
mmm , mmm , mmm
when there's other people around
you never wanna kiss me
you tell me it's too late to hang out
then you say you miss me
and i loved you from the start
so it breaks my heart
when you say i'm just a friend to you
'cause friends don't do the things we do
everybody knows you love me too
tryna be careful with the words i use
i say it cause i'm dying to
i'm so much more than just a friend to you
you - oh - oh - oh - oh
you - oh - oh - oh - oh
you - oh - oh - oh - oh
you - oh - oh - oh - oh
you say i'm just a friend to you
friends don't do the things we do
everybody knows you love me too
i try to be careful with the words i use
i'll say it 'cause i'm dying to
i'm so much more than just a friend to you
a friend to you
a friend to you
a friend to you
