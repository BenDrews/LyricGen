moment of silence for the champions
for those who make goin' hard a lifestyle
never waver
nothing , gotta get it right now
i'm in the spotlight
when they turn the lights down
only a champ swings the hardest in the 12th round
i love the 4th quarter
i love the 9th inning
i love game 7
bring on the competition
cause in my heart , can't nobody do it better
can't slow me down
won't stop me never
i'm so cassius clay
i'm tyson in his prime
you don't leave with it
i'm barry bonds with mine
i beat the buzzer , baby
my stroke is hole in one
you see the checkered flag
finish line , here i come
and i ain't gotta brag
i let the trophies do it
around here , we the best
now come and hold me to it
i specialize in everything that can't be done
ain't no more talk about it
moment of silence for the champions
they say we warriors
they say we did it again
( hands high for the champions ! )
we are victorious
we only in it to win
( stand up for the champions ! )
no surrender , no retreat
we take the battlefield over every time
( yeah , clap your hands for the champions ! )
we came , we saw , we conquered everything in sight
moment of silence for the champions !
ay yo , ay yo , ay yo
that's the sound you hear from the crowd when we come through
( they screaming... )
ay yo , ay yo , ay yo
we run the town here , can't you tell when we come through ?
they screaming... the champions !
cause we are... the champions !
yes , we be... the champions !
cause we are... the champions !
they screaming... the champions !
can't nobody compare with us
there ain't no competitors
no wonder why we are
we are the champions
you read the newspapers , you saw the magazines
you got the internet , but you ainâ€™t gotta google me
my name is up in lights , my face is well - known
you see us super bowl dancing in the end zone
you see us taking shots of vodka out the stanley's cup
you see us running out and telling you what , we're fired up
and in my heart , can't nobody do better
can't slow me down , won't stop me never
i'm dale earnhardt , i'm so michael phelps
so many gold medals , too many title belts
i started all - state and came up from there
now i'm a world champ and reppin' everywhere
call me incredible , work ethic impeccable
i did it for the decimals , and now i can't let it go
i specialize in everything that can't be done
ain't no more talk about it
moment of silence for the champions
they say we warriors
they say we did it again
( hands high for the champions ! )
we are victorious
we only in it to win
( stand up for the champions ! )
no surrender , no retreat
we take the battlefield over every time
( yeah , clap your hands for the champions ! )
we came , we saw , we conquered everything in sight
moment of silence for the champions !
ay yo , ay yo , ay yo
that's the sound you hear from the crowd when we come through
( they screaming... )
ay yo , ay yo , ay yo
we run the town here , can't you tell when we come through ?
they screaming... the champions !
cause we are... the champions !
yes , we be... the champions !
cause we are... the champions !
they screaming... the champions !
