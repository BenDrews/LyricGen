right right right right right right
here we go , for the hood
you ever feel that rush running through your veins
the rush , the blood , the blood is the beat it can't be contained
the bones is the drums , the fingers the snare , the skin is the strings
the ribs the guitar , itchin' while i sing , itchin' while i rap
foot is the kick , my tongue's the auto - tuned violin
my brain is the mic , i be talkin' to myself
cause i don't know what i be sayin' half of the time
i just be feelin' a certain way out of my mind
you see i come from a rough background ( background )
but i did it and represented , did it and represented
did it and represented for my for my for my whole hood
for my for my for my for my for my whole hood
you see i come from a rough background ( background )
but i did it and represented for my for my for my whole hood
did and represented , did it and represented
for my for my for my for my whole hood
hood superhero chameleon , chains with my cape on
from a baller to a rapper , rapper with my cape on
i've been infected with this disease called passion
you could see it on my sleeve you could hear it when i'm rappin'
smell it when i'm sweatin' , feel it when i'm cryin'
if i don't make music i'm probably dyin'
i go back in the studio and breathe life in me
make another track , that's right , vitamins for me
nutrients be the thoughts goin' through my brain
the antidote for me , i'm special in this paint
people ask me why i rap , well why you listen to music ?
why you rap ? why you don't rap ? why you botherin' me , stupid ?
why your pops drop you on your head ? ask him a question
why my pops dropped me on my head ? cause i'm real reckless
had no choice but to discipline me
beat my motherfuckin' ass and put a good whoopin' to me
but it made me a better man
i could've been crazy like eminem's fan , stan
actually i feel like stan
cause i be rallyin' motherfuckers like that kimbo man
