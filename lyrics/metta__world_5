i cry for mike
yo , i understand controversy
i understand words , try and hurt me
they said i ain't worthy
they said you ain't worthy
i'm glad you wasn't growing up in my hood
where the good die early
yes ! sounds for mike
remember the time during thriller you was grinding
grinding , had me open , i was wyling
red jacket pimp , leather glove
you used to show me love
i know you didn't know me but you showed me love
you held the world with your words : diamonds
priceless. ? every line so i can buy
your cd in the store
i hope all the kids is doing well
and fuck everybody hatin , they can go to hell , i swear
get off my nigga's back
all his music was straight crack , ? like that
mj mj , you in my prayers
i know you in heaven , i hope to see you next year
stop , everybody
listen to the heartbeat of michael still living
in my body , and he's living in you
what would you do if it wasn't for my dude ?
and your dude , he's our dude
he's a real tight dude
the most original , most official
he inspired guys like jamie foxx , and usher too
keeping you alive , ? moon over the earth and sand dunes too
play pretty young thing when i'm chillin with my boo
in the club
and even though i'm always strapped
i'm putting down my mack for mike jack
