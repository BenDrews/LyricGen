i’m focused , i’m loc’n , i’m zonin’ , you jonesin’
i get it in , you get it out , my heart way bigger than a grown man
you burn fire , i burn lava , i spit poison , you spit saliva
we the same age but i’m still like your father
i will not lose – i’ll singe you , i’ll pass you , i’ll crash you
run through you and your whole crew
it get to the point where… i need to get two
i chop and screw the lightning , swallow thunder
then i park in mid - air , roll up to lightning , blow it out
cerebellum can’t handle critics who yellin’
straight forward like iron man , no stainless steel propellers
satisfied , never i , like that arkansas guy
fingertips itchy if you comin’ next to my ride
i’m zonin’…

bright lights and the big screen
man this be my kid dream
since 15 , i’ve seen this scene
with a chick’s face , and a kid’s scream
just wish my mama could’ve been here
wish my brother could be free
wish my daddy was still alive
wish my granny could still see
me ball out like them ball players
now my best friends be ball players
and my girlfriends got girlfriends
and we all laugh , we all players
i remember sittin’ in the projects
daydreamin’ like we got next
and i’m ridin’ around with world peace
in queensbridge we call him artest
came forward , yes – go back , no
what you think i rap for ?
same reason he used to trap for
with the pit bulls by the back door
got a lot of people that hate me
they hate me ‘cause they ain’t me
and that’s the bottom line , bottom line , yup…
frankly , i’mma keep this between you and me
i ain’t worried ‘bout that scrutiny
only thing that i’m worried about
is them young boys when they shootin’ , b
scared that they might shoot me
i pray to god they ain’t shoot me
but i’m in the zone , i’m in the zone
i’m feelin’ like i’m 2 - 3
