blood in my gatorade , i was raised different
i said blood in my gatorade , i was raised different
i said blood in my gatorade , i was raised different
i said blood in my gatorade , i was raised different
i was raised , i was raised different
i said blood in my gatorade , i was raised different
i was raised , i was raised different
i was raising that south , too , way the sharks do
when we came up in the hood only shit that came around
i’m like a shoe sting , most never seen that
get up my way , i see a brain frozen in that ground
came up , was raised up , buy the dogs , they was 5% haitian
you a reporter , they hate us , i love every block that i came from
mom and dad came from , they told me stay tough
always move forward , never back up
stay hustling , blood in my water cup
blood in my gatorade , yeah , drink it up
we adapt to survive , clap at it , call it eye for an eye
this is a very strange life , people wanna know why i act like that
this blood is in my gatorade , blood sport
when i play is not a game , i’m not afraid
if niggas feel some kind of way
pockets broke , i can’t pay , the new paint , they in the crowd
i’m playing in the game , you pay to get it now
it’s blood coming out the speakers , beef is fun , nose bleeders
can’t afford the good seats , why you mad at me for ?
…like a reefer , gets you turned like a jump season
take a number , wait in line , for my head
i don’t taste sappy drama , i just booby trap clowns
i just walk a straight line , cross my path , it’s man down
we born to score it , y’all niggas is boring
you never made a hot zone , never did a touring
ten pack stadium , we selling amnesia
cool pack and titty bar , nobody care to see your corny ass song
you ain’t hard like lamar , you ain’t bad , you ain’t here
you ain’t a warrior like me
i was raised to go in , there’s blood in my gatorade
killing all these dreams and all i do is bring heat in
spitting that crazy fire , just causing that competition
rule for nothing , that make you green like a villain
me , i’m no different , still hustling hard
doing missions , catch me in the booth like i’m cooking in the kitchen
…in the mind , never tripping , slipping ‘cause all i do is keep winning
another oath for my concrete jungle
it wasn’t always just cops cutting , jump throat
southern california wasn’t nice to me
but it taught me right and that was life to me
‘cause i was raised different
said i’ll never make it but i never listen
‘cause i was raised different
said i’ll never make it but i never listen
