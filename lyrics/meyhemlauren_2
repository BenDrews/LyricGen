respect the fly shit , glorious stature
my words capture
new york city's fear before the taliban disaster
self induced illness , floating in my own rapture
my niggas make flips and play cakes without a spatula
we gets it in , sample my aura as a indication
i know your story , son , your soap opera's in syndication
exposing fraudulence with fact , your dead off vindication
hit the bottom first to reach the top
i call it innovation
an invasion , incineration is how we burning 'em
mean chucking a philosophy book
my voice is learning 'em
dollar bills never came free
we steady earning 'em
at all costs , we all floss
your team lost , i'm so boss
at least my own , release my chrome
get blown into a different zone
x'd out and wonder y like a male chromosome ( what ! )
i hold my own and my squad's well known
don't make a nigga hand deliver punishment to your dome
it's all !
my mind ready like ray lewis
jumping out the gray buick
twisted ankles never stop us
cause we play through it
i spit that shit that make jordan jumper a sure shot
same shit to make 'em build a wooden room up in a whore spot
right out the sewer , deadly with maneuver
got the power of a rhino
and i'm agile as a puma
suede shit be the basic
empty clips and then replace it
cause the verbal .47 chopping pussies get erase - d
off the map
my silhouette , it got the hookers crazy
poking holes up in the condom
trying to trap me with a baby
but i keep 'em dreaming , that's for the semen
they keep on fiending
cause nowadays it's just brain , just call me bobby heenan
i'm marley steaming
lace the swordfish with the garlic cream and
the lemon basil caper dil , play the street for real
cream de ville is what i used to sport
the yiddish lawyer with a yarmi , how this muthafucka do in court
peugeot sport was purchased by my father first , man
shift with the left hand , back then he was a mets fan
to be specific , i'm horizontal once the trees are twisted
absorb the essence cause it changes with the seeds sifted
you muthafuckas ain't telling me nothing
we pack the power of a roman candle
outdoorsmen animal , so catch us on the nature channel
rare species , mush you in the face with feces
this is hbo rap , not regular tv
i be the type to make your wifey hand you papers
and say ya'll splitting up
because my semen is her favorite flavor
vanilla ice cream , baskin robbins got nothing on me
i'm in the hooker house with bronson
bitches sucking on me
free of charge , we at large
" love me in a special way " like el debarge
big time like vinny chase in entourage
my team's the hardest , we like ts back in '99
go try and find another squadron with our kind of grind
you got the king , you got the chef , you got the coroner
you got the beast , meyhem lauren right in your corridor
killa sha , prince , take - it and the animal
there's only science , we eat rappers like a cannibal
check the manual , wack rap niggas is food
fuck a ross , only rick is ravishing rude
i'm from a era where your skills got you recognized
ya'll from an era where your favorite rapper testifies
fraudulent fucks , the game's being twisted up
and don't approach me if you ain't nice with your fisticuffs
we beat a artist down , dig his pockets , split his bucks
and that's a threat , so i dare you to try to shit on us
