straight up , i don't expect y'all niggas to understand me
niggas ain't exposed to real shit
they think everything's a fucking movie
it's not all about a character , dogs
it's about real people
it's about real life , man
y'all niggas live in a fucking box
straight up
a pitchfork is a devilish tool , we don't use those
real shotty under the seat , get your crew froze
cracked jokes after the crime and dropped knowledge
87 credits , sold drugs and dropped college
career criminal , but volunteered at the youth center
tried to drop jewels on the kids and let the truth enter
real new york shit , you out - of - towners wouldn't get it
my resume is realistic , son , i fucking live it
it's a thin line between the critter and the critic
what you see is what you get , so motherfuck a gimmick
my life is real , so every day is different , can't predict it
same with the thoughts that's reflected in my rhymes
some days we lift books , and other times we hold nines
shit , i'm no more contradictory than my life is
plates with wild spices , on point , control vices
stay sharp , rep with preciseness , i'm priceless

faggot - ass journalist niggas
like , if you always spit the same shit
niggas say , oh , he's one dimensional , he's not diverse , blah blah blah
then when you hit 'em with all angles , let them see you a real person
different sides of you
fucking smart dumb niggas can't even analyze that shit
get the fuck out of here , man
you write about us
fuck a character , my only style is straightforward
sometimes i drive slow , and other times i straight floor it
either way , you see me whippin both i'm still me
i let my story speak for itself , i'm so g
that means godly - - picture pitchforks piercing me
fun - loving , fight when it on and move fiercefully
renaissance man , fresh , far from forgettable
unfiltered version of my life , i'm hospitable
sit , have a seat , marinate in my mindstate
crush competition , then contribute to the crime rate
i think life's a bitch ; literally , i'm on a blind date
how could someone analyze the real if they define fake ?
people like myself be on the top cause we design fate
whole life , took matters into my own hands
y'all niggas still fucking with old plans , we graduates
swing swords , shooting up spots to tame savages

" kelly kapowski "
yeah , you guys really got that one , man
" a generic love song " - - that's what that song was about
i'm just a grown man obsessed with saved by the bell
pat yourselves on the back for such genius
in analyzing that fucking song
you guys really know it all over there , man
crafted , cleverly , kelly kapowski's cocaine
cornball comprehension cause confusion , no brain
if you couldn't comprehend it , you don't understand much
laurenovici isn't tv , rep a world you can't touch
silk shirts and sodomy , son , fuck the lottery
official how it's gotta be , my city is an odyssey
fly talk , rocks camo and floats over your domepiece
my niggas' flow heats disown streets cause i'm a known beast
move dolo most the time , rock polo , 'posed to shine
international think rational , niggas supposed to grind
i visit three worlds about every three hours
so my vision's unclear to these play the scene cowards
confusing , wondering , like an eye without vision
how my slang is running wild , like a world without prison
i infuse the olive oil drizzle on your meal
hit these devils with they own pitchfork , so let em squeal
it's laurenovich
analyze that , you fucking genius - ass niggas , man
you really know it all , man
they're real great guys over there , man
shout out to the whole staff
you got some real excellent writers writing for you , man
you guys should quit journalism and just be detectives
such genius is being wasted on a motherfucking blog
