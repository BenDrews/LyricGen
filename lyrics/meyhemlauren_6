thousand dollar gym shoes , it's us there
silk headwraps in a plush bag , it's us there
you can catch us up in mr. chow's often
brand name drugs that we flossin' , marvel
peep the visual
fly shit 40 years back
mink to the floor , hoppin' out of cadillac
gators match the whip , hammers attached to hip
that's how my father move with honor on the harlem strip
fast forward i design , grime prime time
let my mind intertwine with the skyline
respectable , intellectual , but love shine
so everyday i try to win this , in my bloodline
love crime negative shit , i'm quick to go legit
just give me something legal , not evil , that i can flip
new york is foul , will greet you with a desert eagle rip
shooters for hire , quick to fire for a half a zip
and fuck a glass , that's shit's the past
use a carafe to sip
transporters on a boat with coke inside a plastic hip
" how to be a stupid nigga " is the class we skipped
divy up after a flip and hit strippers with cash we split
spin blaster on the four , i'm from new york
we crash the sport just for sport
dressed for court , bless the lord
drink chammy out of prince's grammy
my beard wavy like sandy
full moon , howlin' with the headdress
push a beamer like a bench press
one leg up , rockin' some red sweats
bedspreads with african models on them
open they pussy , put a bottle in it for them
bitches jump in my balls like a mcdonald's park
i'm at the forum , stacking paper , plural
if we were locked up , we'd move the ?
you'd be abused for oral
and just continue as if things were normal
not a peep , my people drive a lot of jeeps
a bunch of creeps , cannons hidden under seats
sell salmon , so my son can eat
trying to have a little taste of this life until i'm underneath
it's me
