straight up
( la música de harry fraud )
catch us on stage looking like drug lords
pen paragraphs for all my niggas that sling swords
whips , chain seasonal , roofs get removed
bitches baggin bundles new , our vocals getting eq
live nigga rap , real talk that’s us ( us )
cashmere everything , gats that bust ( bust )
outdoors , break laws , the streets we trust
make noise , never talk to the boys , let em discuss
call the doctor , lay you where you eat your pasta
with big choppers , from the rastas in the helicopter
video games , we don’t play
ps3 rappers get broken in broad day
right on myrtle and broadway
run up in the ( booby ? /movie ? ) spot and hit em where they all stay
family ties , reason why your family cries
while a nigga shorty wop with vanity eyes
we the stars of our own movies
sly stallone couldn’t move me
feet up on the sofa rolling a doobie
i walk with the strength of ten million hood niggas
who like to cause ruckus and love to pull triggers
habitual line steppers always trying to undercut
name on a dotted line , reserve the right to fuck you up
i’m kobe with the rock , you a 4th quarter lebron nigga , ready to slop
back to that other shit , listing like a wet seal
work phone ringing , fiends looking for a fresh deal
blind stances turn the mind trances
shorty’s flat footed but her nose does line dances
i love that intricate thug rap , supply it often
they tried to clip my wings i’ll never be retired flossing
sipping silent , thinking violent , call it quiet saucing
the jewels i’ve picked up over years is an acquired fortune
been burning shit consecutive , we never tire torchin’
your reputation has no juice , me i'm admired often
bitches wanna smoke , we give them floral rinses
that pass they mouth around and turn them to a oral princess
it’s just the way we move , welcome to ny
meisterstück , in the coop , nigga my pen fly
? snake sour ? shower your whip , if it’s a time of war
we use to grind with raw , hustlin' in the fine velour
couple dollars in a fiend ( cheese ) pocket
scurry to the side of the building to cop it
scurry back to the lobby to rock it
i’m talking white olivia dukakis , joan cusack
suede shoe , blue coupe roof back
( ayo the cops comin ) boof that
then break it down so you can toot - toot - a - loot that
straight from queens , loafer to the pedal
steaks are medium rare , hosted for the metal ( medal ? )
i’m getting closer with the devil
i won’t stop til there’s an ocean on the bezel
sand art in my weed jar
did a backflip right into the window of the green car
then i peel like an orange , leather outfits martin lawrence
three prongs on the pasta fork , spin the bucatini
doo doo stains in the joint
it’s me
