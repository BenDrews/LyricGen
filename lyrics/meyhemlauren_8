yo , gucci kicks got me looking like a poinsettia
don't speak all week , i appoint cheddar
son with the bald head , left 'em all dead
he back servin' the spot , keepin' us all fed
grilled swordfish , pineapple relish
eyes lookin' hellish , i would die for my fellas
fly like propellers , y'all niggas jealous
i don't give a fuck about shit that you could tell us
i'm only worried 'bout new checks
touch down in philly , cop sneakers from suplex
size 55 carti's on my facial
stash crib lookin palatial , we glacial
we do badmon ting , badmon ting
i put that motherfuckin' hoodie on
i pull that motherfuckin' skully down
we do gunman ting , gunman ting
the all - black tim boot
stay cool cause motherfuckers will shoot
flow worldwide , still poli on the bliddock
talk out your face get whipped just like a rental
respect my frame , i'm built just like a bulldozer
teeth so white they never get pulled over
damn it i'm gorgeous
couple self - portraits up in the fortress
larry david , larry davis
my style is like a mix of both , i'm outrageous
and ain't nobody out my family reach
my neck holds more cubans than miami beach
bitch
persian rugs , asian antiques
new whips just to caravan freaks
sorry i'm late , i'm stuck in drug traffic
pistols precise , we carry thug plastic
play the block every night cause we nocturnal
my wrist looks like a page out the watch journal
i get it shaking like the pulp settled at the bottom
things y'all niggas rap about , my niggas really got em
my thigh is cramped from hoppin' off a jetski
my life is great , you think that you could stress me ?
shit , i'm a motherfuckin' g
this is grown man rap , rest in peace sean p
