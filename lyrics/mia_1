loving too much will leave you blue and i ain't pledge sigma
i'm a real nigga , giving feelings just ain't me
the more attention you give em , the more options they seek
talk is cheap , knew i should've kept the receipt
she said she loyal , but all bitches gonna talk in the streets
that's how i play it , how i play it , all it is is game
as i hit another paper plane i'm mia
since you've been away , love's been m.i.a
m.i.a. , m.i.a. , m.i.a
done looking for love , cause she took away her
now i'm m.i.a. , m.i.a
no love , no love
done looking for love , cause she took away her love
fuck her , i don't care
