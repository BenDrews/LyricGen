and i’m always where the
sun don’t shine , the
tears don’t show , won't
hurt me now 'cause
heart's been broke , i
hate myself but
it won't show , i
constantly lose all
my remorse , and it's
ten for the wolf and
three for the shepherd and it's
one for the sheep who
led by a leopard , often
gave his perception as a
handle of weapon , took a
bite of your apple , give me
all you can offer , now i'm
trapped in a changing maze
setting my soul ablaze
couldn’t control the pace
where is this going ? hey
heartless is recklessness , it is
word of a pacifist to
word of a masochist , i'm
off of the map , my lord i
spoke to a baphomet , he
said he would save me if i
gave him one thing he needed
what is this thing i pleaded ?
boy , it's the key to eden
yeah
and as i spoke my fangs were shown
taken aback , he smiles and tells me
" what you crave will soon be yours
but what i crave is already mine "
