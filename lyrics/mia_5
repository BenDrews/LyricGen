live fast , die young , bad girls do it well
live fast , die young , bad girls do it well
live fast , die young , bad girls do it well
live fast , die young , bad girls do it well
my chain hits my chest when i'm banging on the dashboard
my chain hits my chest when i'm banging on the radio
get back , get down
pull me closer if you think you can hang
hands up , hands tied
don't go screaming if i blow you with a bang
suki suki
i'm coming in the cherokee gasoline
there's steam on the window screen take it , take it
wheels bouncing like a trampoline
when i get to where i'm going , gonna have you trembling
oh back it , back it
yeah pull up to the bumper game read the signal
cover me , cause i'm changing lanes
i had a handle on it
my life , but i broke it
when i get to where i'm going
gonna have you saying it
going nought to bitch i'll see four million
accelerating fast i can do this in a second
lookin' in the rear view , swaggin' goin' swell
leavin' boys behind ‘cause it’s illegal just to kill
shift gear , automatic , damned if i do
who's gonna stop me when i'm coming through ?
what we got left is just me and you
but if i go to bed , baby , can i take you ?
