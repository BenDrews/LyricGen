mause
fumes from the paint can , slither through the night
tunes from a waste land , visionary light
i'm giving people life from the mouth of a reaper
i'm like malcolm the teacher , announced through the speaker
my father taught me that buying a house is procedure
and beds are a privilege when a couch cushions cheaper
sleeping on the floor isn't a doubtful procedure
when your dreams are the reality of doubt to receivers
leaving my mark , in a literary state
on buildings and estates , no filters for my paint
i'm filming what i make
dark clothes on , what i throw on , these pilgrims wanna hate
on the pillars that i make
a gathering for my comrades
passionate what i forecast
question marks on they forehead
looking at me when they walk past
outlaw throwing the law out
there's an out - pour of what i thought out
cops got me all sought out
cause my work now get me more clout
uh
building my name up , never thought it get like this
yall do the same stuff , yall ain't see no shit like this
remain humble through it all , man i don't bogart
remember my past life and that helps me go so hard
sleeping on benches , the stenches from the bums are so relentless
but so is my drive , my hearts an engine
fuel , labored so long fingers that draw what i have viewed
my table is gone , eat on the floor while i chew
young painter looking at the front pagers
the basquiats , the warhols , all the plush painters
inspiration on a daily basis
i copped a can and went bombing like hiroshima in train stations
last name numerical
question what i'm telling you
ill question plus riddle you like batman in the physical
think about it , & keep it with you like a souvenir
and when you do come find me , ill be in union square
i think its a lot of people that are neglected in art , i don't know because if its too many of the paintings or what. but um... i know black people are never really portrayed realistically. or not even portrayed in modern art. its just um... up for a change you know ?
