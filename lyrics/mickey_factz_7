light skin niggas back in his crappy feelings
ironically shit is over a factz opinion
notice the talent and cope with the silence
drake ain't respond and like a bitch you got emotional at it
guess its me that gotta show you the balance
i was melo til the bullshit , weighed in , guess who rose to the challenge
fly guy sho gave my thoughts from the sideline chump
and you should know the consequences of a blindside punch
why lie , the tides high , get your tye - dye trunks
ain't been the same since wu - tang fucked the wifi up
social media whore , on twitter crying , nigga skyping
glad ice took ya laptop , quit the typing
ran from the ghost , no snapchat , this man wacker
drake took tahiry cookies , aubrey graham crack her
triple entendre , boy we rocking , all these options and you chose mickey ?
the metaphor b hopkins ?
the bars keep popping , ignore these , your jaw keep dropping
and give joe l's while ortiz watching
im jason vorheese boxing , tapping his pockets like he lost his car keys , watch it
boy please you can't pass the bar sheesh
make his soul reach cochran
bloody glove , gary payton with it
goons put the beam on his eye and give em laser vision
shoulda been signed to star trek how you klingon shit
and i ain't worried bout a fight , you only swing on chicks
battled hollow shit was so petty with ya ego
put the mic down , don't tell me you was emo
ima cancer , give his whole skeleton the chemo
and turn joe budden to joe pesci in casino
soul snatch , yall know factz , every flows crack
doing the same shit since 05 ? where the growth at ?
wait up , the same mickey i dont change up quick
drizzy responded at a show and upstaged yo shit
leave you laid up stiff , i spit straight up piff
i did real songs with drake no made up shits
imaginary friendships one sided , loves dying
royce hated my pants but now he sending doves flying
all these punches hitting ya lip , now the blood drying
bone thugs , this what it sounds like when thugs crying
his fans gon say he live his life like truman show
fuck that , turning this shit to the freddy krueger show
nightmare in jersey , arsonal had you losing bro
that water gun shit ain't nothing to a bazooka joe
hit his gums , we can do this rap shit forever
radio , track for track nigga whatever
