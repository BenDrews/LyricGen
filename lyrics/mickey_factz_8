you think darkness is your ally
you merely adopted the dark
i was born in it
molded by it
i didn't see the light until i was already a man
by then it was nothing to me but blinding !
as i toast the chardonnay
i hear the ghost of marvin gaye
so for the next six minutes
all you're gonna hear is the spirit in my lyrics
what's goin' on , unpaid cable
left my label , their unchanged angle
tried to outfox me , bad boy locks me
but nyu law taught me about proxies
reborn martin luther
i'm in a new position don't need kama sutra
stylings for my ex , ? her
i stopped lookin' for her when i thought about my future
passive , artist with a passion
sculptor , when it come to clay i'm cassius
vulture , when it's time to pray , i'm a mantis
the culture , what it is today , outlandish
mr. fantastic will think that the fashion's in y - 3 fabric
polo bedspread on a king sized mattress
so every night , i can dream about pastures
love when i ran by your city
stand by mickey if you can't find diddy
they say i'm lazy
my catalog'll fill a terabyte like a vampire bit me
woah , woah , woah , hold it
icon poet and i barely even show it
langston hughes made my views so i wrote it
i do it for my mama but i don't think she know it
thick beard and i spit flare
the achievement is comin' out this year
let the words penetrate through yah
loveatfirstsound , let it serenade to yah
smile the pain through
you're cryin' , ain't you ?
time will make you
fine , thank you
young man from the ghetto
wifey preggo , real life gecko
she wanted assurance , he wanna settle
makin' of his ? that ring black and yellow
decent little job , payin' all the bills
savin' for a house and prayin' for a mil
where the 401k at ?
southside of chicago , that's where he stays at
southside of chicago , that's where they spray at
he's tryna be out , cause he 'ont really play that
good man with a good plan
shook hands with the jeweler and he put grands
into the ring he bought to give to her
this is the dream he thought for his future
imagine , family matters
but nothing could compare for what's about to happen
wifey texts him , " head to the market
pick up an orange , ice cream , i'm starvin'
pack of chicken legs , plus a milk carton
for the last time , please don't forget the margarine "
he wrote back , " baby don't worry "
she replied , " hurry , i wanna cook curry "
he got her all the groceries and jumped in his hummer
but then , halfway home , he forgot the butter
turned back around , bought that and donuts
and just to surprise her , he even got roses
headed back home and he stopped at a light
when shots started goin' through his car , ?
oh shit , he died
notified his girlfriend , she cried
blood on the flowers that he got
and now his one chance to be happy has been shot
