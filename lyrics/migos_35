( 808 mafia ) this the intro
for all you fuckboys that ever doubted the migos

fuckboy , bow down
spin off in the coupe , typhoon ( skrt skrt )
i act an ass , baboon
wrappin' that dope , cocoon
young rich nigga in the room
finesse a nigga , no raccoon
spendin' m&m's in june
took a trip to cancun

yeah , i bought the benz off the lot
just to give your ho a lift
i'm havin' the sauce in the refrigerator
just make sure you bring the chips
ayy , it's a fuck nigga in the back
just look at him , look at him plot
he prolly think it's a club light
but really it's the red dot
fucked a bitch and hit the lot
nigga fumblin' with the pot
i broke my wrist in the pot
hit the block , brought back a knot
jj watt is on the block ( woop woop )
kept me runnin' from the cops
don't buy the car , we want the lot ( skrt skrt )
i need everything in stock
act pints in the attic
pussy niggas puttin' on an act ( act )
fucked the bitch and broke her back
i fucked the bitch and gave her back
thumbin' through a hundred
thumbin' through a hundred racks
know you ain't one hundred
your chain might get snatched
i wanna whip up some pies today
how many niggas gon' ride today ?
how many niggas gon' slide and grab on they nine
when i say it's time to slay ?
jump in the crowd and get live today
heard you talkin' through the wire today
i'ma pull up with that fire , aim at his eye
i bet he gon' die today
yeah , screw that lil' tip on that dirty lil' uzi ( yeah )
i put a seven in a thot coochie ( yeah )
niggas get money , don't know how to use it ( yeah )
i whipped up the babies , harambe , abused it

tired of runnin' from the cops ( 12 )
pourin' lean on the rocks ( mud )
mink fur , that's a fox ( vrrt )
quarter million in the vault ( quarter k )
i'ma let the semi talk ( whole k )

perky got me feelin' nauseous
