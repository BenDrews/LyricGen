the way it seems , the streets be looking at me like a teacher
they hounding me , desperate rappers waiting for a feature
i ain't saying i don't need you , i'm saying let's keep the pace
should be back at your place , just being patient with your feet up
they say he's so chill , how he show no stress ?
he can't see into the future , how does he know what's next ?
seeing all of these steps that he's taking
you're mistaken if they say we ain't so complex
i'm tryna be in a blue coupe , you can't pronounce the name
with a bad yellow bitch and she's singing purple rain , so insane
and people talking down on me , i don't really think they should
they said they could do it better , i don't really think they could
i ain't one for niggas wishes , but i wish a nigga would
this ain't as easy as it looks , i just make it look good
yeah they talking down on me , i don't really think they should
they said they could do it better , i don't really think they could

if it's politics , we're the presidents so presence serves a purpose
it's obvious that we're evidence , you're paying for a service
and i feel , you always think you're less than what you can be
what does it mean if i think i'm the one these niggas can't see ?
gang mentality , odd future is a family
my niggas thrash , i was always anti plan b
did i lose you ? i know i'm much more than you're used to
now i got these girls stepping out from their usual
so they tune in , t.i. , see i , realize i'm a stand up guy
and these niggas realize they can't stand to see me on tv
so they lose their footing like they were gluttons with diabetes
but fuck the bullshit , i'm just tryna get rich
with my middle fingers up screaming swag me out bitch
black kid on the corner selling drugs , go figure
salute them with 21 guns , i'm killing these niggas
