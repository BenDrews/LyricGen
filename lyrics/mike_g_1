nothin' but rage in my entity , a page for a symphony
still a fuckin' firestarter lighters ain't on this degree
my shining will never stop , fuck runnin' from every cop
wait 'til the sun goes down and have a showdown out in salem's lot
still workin' the night shift , i am the doorway
golf clubs for violence this a different kinda foreplay
sometimes they come back , sometimes they don't
and sometimes i give a fuck but most times i won't
and i think sometimes i'm made to sin , beat them 'til the broom is bent
take a trip and add it to the bodies out in chamberlain
the lawnmower man couldn't see all the holes i dug
rifles on my back like i'm some fuckin' kinda soldier bro
i'm the devil , they'd nickname my fury christine
see me through the mist , i'm a motherfuckin' king
i know the cycle of the werewolf , the reverend couldn't see him
through the mist still exist as a motherfuckin' king
i'm the devil , if ever there was such a thing
see me through the mist , i'm a motherfuckin' king
i know the cycle of the werewolf , the reverend couldn't see him
through the mist still exist as a motherfuckin' king
i'm a motherfuckin' king , i'm a motherfuckin' monster
readin' books on murder ? i'm the motherfuckin' author
tell you where we finna go , welcome to my creep show
stay out my secret garden , i got a wolf named cujo
that's guardin' it , i'm experienced you need a starter kit
long walk , short pier , roadwork there's no clear
no air , heard your daughter's missin' they can't find that bitch
nowhere , nowhere , still lack is no fear
no heart in my chest cause i was born without
no heart in her chest cause i took that shit out
and they can't find girl two , they said that she was lost
and they can't find me cause i'm duckin' the law
and still fuckin' them all , and never lovin' these broads
and never cuffin' unless i'm cuffin' them in a morgue
say i'm twisted and demented but murder can fascinate
white girl in a white dress and that's my prom date , carrie
i'm the devil , they'd nickname my fury christine
see me through the mist i'm a motherfuckin' king
i know the cycle of the werewolf , the reverend couldn't see him
through the mist still exist as a motherfuckin' king
i'm the devil , if ever there was such a thing
see me through the mist , i'm a motherfuckin' king
i know the cycle of the werewolf , the reverend couldn't see him
through the mist still exist as a motherfuckin' king
i'm a motherfuckin' king
i'm a motherfuckin' king
