i could spend my whole life tryna get cash
and work hard then i pass like steve nash
breath fast , i ain't tryna hyperventilate
forgive me lord , it feels like i commit a sin a day
then i wait for them days to turn good again
and get the cake , then i'll tell them that's the winners pay
to win today would just seem like a lavish dream
know what they mean , everything ain't what it seems
the angels sing and i feel like thats my roll call
and i came with left brain , that's my road dawg
switch lanes ? nah homie i'm a road hog
brain to the pave look my mind on the road dawg
said i'm just tryna do this quick like make haste
don't take more than i can get to prevent waste
my music is like confetti rain when you win a race
and you'll probably lose your mind tryna save face
scarface , say i got that montana flow
they know i'm tryna get that montana dough
where we go , tell the truth i could never know
i'm just tryna push a porsche , that's white like montana snow
and honestly , just for wings i would give it up
so if it's true '12 couldn't come fast enough
and when it comes i just hope i'm on my way above
the say they're heartless , but i feel them when they show me love
i'm sitting on this couch , wrist bloody
the therapist nicknamed me kid cutty , i killed my fifth buddy
the fourth one , i like to kick around
ride him all around , when he hits the ground
the third one is mixed , white and black
minor , flat , major , act like a pitch with a flanger
the second one's a stranger , but i knew her all my life
since i was born , the other half said fuck it like i was porn
and the last one , he's in the mirror
with a gun , wish i could see him clearer
but i can't cause my eyes are red , now he's dead
aye , hold your head homie , look
i'mma live long through these songs
as long as they're on , i'm on when i'm gone
that's why i rhyme like a poet from a prior century
and i don't wanna be a human , treat me like an entity
i know they fiend for my 8's like i'm a fucking laker
tryna find a secret garden just like tyler the creator
damn , i'm just waiting for my life to begin
and i can't breath when i'm high cause the airs too thin
i'll let out a couple sighs , tell them exhale
they know they shouldn't touch me like the third rail
shit , i'm living in hell , the devil should be scared of me
nigga ask about me , i am mike g
