one shot , everything rides on tonight
even if i've got three strikes
i'mma go for it
this moment , we own it
and i'm not to be played with
because it can get dangerous
see these people i ride with
this moment , we own it
now i just feel like i'm gonna win
whole mid - west side , that's my kin
beneath your beautiful that's my pen
you trying to get dope but i just am
i was born with it , did a tour with it
them overseas girls always give you more digits
i've been blessed , i done went shore to shore with it
now trying to help a couple kids do more with it
got some plaques on the wall and i'm still dope
i'm just trying to show the people that there's still hope
you buy a album and we serve up a meal bro
the label's like " that's gonna cost you a mill bro "
so be it , god told me to
and momma don't believe in that but i know it's true
we came to spread a little love that's what we gonna do
finally famous in the house that's the only crew
i bought it , i own it
you borrow , i loan it
i got people rocking clothes with my fucking name on it
she said " milli do your thing "
so i built a stage on it , now my bed rocking
rocking like one of my shows
all she wearing is perfume , she love my cologne
and i been waiting on my moment what feel like forever
but the more i think about it shit it's probably better
cause i keep working , i keep grinding , i keep writing , i keep rhyming
i'mma turn a single stone into a pile of diamonds
i remember when i didn't have the funds to buy shit
holla if that's something that you can identify with
but now i drop a grip on the jeans
and now i drop your rent on some weed
and now i'm making love on your sheets
i'm in your worst nightmare and in your girlfriend's dreams
wake up , hello , tell me what you see
i'm a skinny motherfucker like six foot three
i said fuck a weight room , i was selling cd's
getting more pussy than the whole football team
i was born in riverside and i'm still that
yeah i heard your new shit and it's still wack
every time we get together you gonna feel that
this summer and the next , i'mma kill that , mills
i got them wetter than a vilbrequin youngest of the champions
beach house music , cue the dark pads and violins
clear glass out in malibu with all my friends
me , mike pos , the mills , and niykee for the win
i'm growing up i gotta buzz call it motivation
blowing up like iphone push notifications
priceless if i had it back i wouldn't change a thing
it's far from over so i tell the fat lady sing
and she hitting the notes and i'm starting to feel
like i can't sit in coach cause i get fucking killed
oh , i own it , oh oh , i'm on it
cold like winterfell i game of throne it
hold it , hold it , did anybody notice
they all in the d now , beantown we own it
shouts to the d.o. beantown we roll it
yeah me and my gs and we own it , yeah sammy
