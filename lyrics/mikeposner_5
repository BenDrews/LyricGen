i took a pill in ibiza
to show avicii i was cool
and when i finally got sober , felt 10 years older
but fuck it , it was something to do
i'm living out in la
i drive a sports car just to prove
i'm a real big baller cause i made a million dollars
and i spend it on girls and shoes
but you don't wanna be high like me
never really knowing why like me
you don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
you don't wanna ride the bus like this
never knowing who to trust like this
you don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
stuck up on that stage singing
all i know are sad songs , sad songs
darling , all i know are sad songs , sad songs
i - i know are sad songs
i - i know are sad songs
i - i know are sad songs
i - i know are sad songs
i'm just a singer who already blew his shot
i get along with old timers
cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
and i can't keep a girl , no
cause as soon as the sun comes up
i cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
but the truth is i can't open up
but you don't wanna be high like me
never really knowing why like me
you don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
you don't wanna ride the bus like this
never knowing who to trust like this
you don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
stuck up on that stage singing
all i know are sad songs , sad songs
darling , all i know are sad songs , sad songs
i - i know are sad songs
i - i know are sad songs
sad songs
i - i know are sad songs
sad songs
i - i know are sad songs
