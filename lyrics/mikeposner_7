i’m a writer and a lover
i’m a midwest music man
and i’ve been to a lot of places
but i’m gon’ end where i began
i took class in carolina
got high smoking joints
and now they know my name in paris
but i’ll be buried in detroit
next to my father , and my father’s father too
i used to live in new york city
but baby that ain’t no substitute
not for my hometown
that place people avoid
i’ve made love in every city
but i’ll be buried in detroit
i don’t claim to be a prophet
i just speak my mind
i try to tell it like it is
and sometimes god makes it rhyme
i like my songs how i like my women
honest and to the point
you see i got fucked up in stockholm
but i’ll be buried in detroit
next to my father , my father’s father too
had a spot in new york city
but baby that ain’t no substitute
not for my hometown
that place people avoid
i’ve made love in every city
but i’ll be buried in detroit
you know i ain’t gon’ live forever
baby it won’t be long
at the wake they’ll say “he made a lot of mistakes
but he could write hell of a song”
and i made , i made killing
though i never really was employed
i had a girl from san diego
but i’ll be buried in
i killed a show in indonesia
but i’ll be buried in
i made love in every city
but i’ll be buried in detroit
