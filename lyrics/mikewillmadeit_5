took niggas out the hood like i'm from there
so you know it's all good when i come there
i hear you talking bout your city like you run that
and i brought my tour to your city
you my son now , nigga
but i had to come through for the remix
oh my , haven't done a verse in eight weeks , sh ! t
and if a nigga say my name he the hot sh ! t
but if i say that nigga name he still the hot sh ! t
fucked up , lucky i don't feed them to the gossip
niggas act like they don't know but they should know
i just thinks it's funny how they danggling the bait
but i'm the one that's killing niggas on the hook though
and niggas ain't got a grill , still ice grill haiting
i know ya'll ready , know mikewillmadeit
just looking at the numbers , nigga i feel amazing
i call michael jordan and mikewillmadeit
i'm the young rap nigga with a melow deal
you need to come to ovo for a better deal
just know a million ain't sh ! t once you get a mil
and niggas say it's all good , that's how you better feel
nigga nah , fuck that , this year i'm talkin big stuff
rollin through the city like a young nigga bricked up
fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
that's why we never gave a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up
