i used to have lots of hoes , shawty thought i was a pimp
see , she fell in love with my stroke , she ain't know that i could swim
she throw that ass back for a g , she know she fuck with a boss
i love when she cum on my d , hop up and she lick it all off
got me gravitatin' with infatuation
had to cut em' off , baby , amputation
made that cancellation for a damn queen
now my hands clean , baby , sanitation
colder than winter , don't wanna lose her
she a winner , my favorite place is up in her
slide in like a splinter , might treat that pussy like dinner
legs in the air like antennas
then climb up on top like a wrestler , she down for the count
hold her leg up whenever i pin her
i cut like a dealer , my baby cum , i cum with her
take care of that box , i deliver , she wet like a river
she drippin' , we lit like a candle
i'm thumbin' the clit like i'm flickin' through channels
we switch positions , i spank her with no paddle
i came on her back like a camel , she shake and i rattle
i cut off all my bitches , only thing on my mind is you
and whenever i'm hittin' it , i'm thinkin' 'bout spending my life with you
swag , while i be pipin' you
swag , i'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
i make lots of money , but i still make time for you
you're sweeter than honey , and these other bitches ain't fly as you
swag , while i be pipin' you
swag , i'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
