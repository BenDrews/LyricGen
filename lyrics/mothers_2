well , all right , starchild
citizens of the universe , recording angels
we have returned to claim the pyramids
partying on the mothership
i am the mothership connection
gettin' down in 3d , light year groovin'
all right , hear any noise
ain't nobody but me and the boys
gettin' down , hit it fellas
if you hear any noise
it's just me and the boys
hit me , you gotta hit the band
all right , all right , starchild here
put a glide in your stride and a dip in your hip
and come on up to the mothership
loose booty , doin' the bump
hustle on over here
ain't nothing but a party , y'all
face it even your memory banks
have forgotten this funk
mothership connection
home of the p. funk , the bomb
doin' it in 3d
let me put on my sunglasses here
so i can see what i'm doing
when you hear seats rumble
you will hear your conscience grumble
hit me , you gotta hit the band
you have overcome for i am here
swing down , sweet chariot
stop and let me ride
swing down , sweet chariot
stop and let me ride
are you hip to easter island ?
the bermuda triangle ?
well , all right
ain't nothing but a party
starchild here , citizens of the universe
i bring forth to you
the good time on the mothership
are you hip ? sing , fellas
starchild here , doin' it in 3d
so good , it's good to me
hit the band
swing low , sweet chariot
coming forth to carry you home
swing low , time to move on
light years in time , ahead of our time
free your mind and come fly
with me , it's hip on the mothership groovin'
