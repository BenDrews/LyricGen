you will grow all you need to grow inside my spine
and then take what you need to take , what's yours is mine
and then just give all you want of it to some new thing
i'll stay here , the provider of that constant sting they call love
they call love
you will drain all you need to drain out of me
all the colors have washed away , no more rosy sheen
not just a pale isolated shallow water place
oh what a place i call myself
i call myself
oh love all you need to love before it goes
when your face becomes a stranger's i don't know
you will never remember who i was to you
carried in the womb
i'm called mother
i'm called mother
they're called home
they're called home
they're called
they're called
mothers
mothers
give all you need to give
and sometimes they won't take what they need to take
the strangest chemical reaction
inside of her brain , no she's not the same
no she's not the same
she's not the same
