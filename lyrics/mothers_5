hey there , people , i'm bobby brown
they say i'm the cutest boy in town
my car is fast , my teeth is shiney
i tell all the girls they can kiss my heinie
here i am at a famous school
i'm dressin' sharp and i'm actin' cool
i got a cheerleader here wants to help with my paper
let her do all the work and maybe later i'll rape her
oh god i am the american dream
i do not think i'm too extreme
an' i'm a handsome son of a bitch
i'm gonna get a good job and be real rich
women's liberation
came creepin' across the nation
i tell you people , i was not ready
when i fucked this dyke by the name of freddie
she made a little speech then
aw , she tried to make me say when
she had my balls in a vise , but she left the dick
i guess it's still hooked on , but now it shoots too quick
oh god i am the american dream
but now i smell like vaseline
an' i'm a miserable sonofabitch
am i a boy or a lady... i don't know which
so i went out and bought me a leisure suit
i jingle my change , but i'm still kinda cute
got a job doin' radio promo
and none of the jocks can even tell i'm a homo
eventually me and a friend
sorta of drifted along into s&m
i can take about an hour on the tower of power
as long as i get a little golden shower
oh god i am the american dream
with a spindle up my butt till it makes me scream
an' i'll do anything to get ahead
i lay awake nights sayin , ' " thank you , fred ! "
oh god , oh god , i'm so fantastic !
thanks to freddie , i'm a sexual spastic
and my name is bobby brown
watch me now ; i'm goin' down
and my name is bobby brown
watch me now ; i'm goin' down
and my name is bobby brown
watch me now ; i'm goin' down
and my name is bobby brown
