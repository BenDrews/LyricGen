ike :
looks to me like something funny
is going on around here
people laughin' 'n dancin' 'n payin'
entirely too much for their beer
and they all think they are
clean outa - site
and they're ready to party
cause the sign outside says it's
wet t - shirt nite
'n they all crave some
hot delight
well the girls are excited
because in a minute
they're gonna get wet
'n the boys are delighted
because all the titties
will get 'em upset
'n they all think they're
reety - awright
'n they're ready to boogie
cause the sign outside says it's
wet t - shirt nite
'n they all crave some
pink delight
when the water gets on 'em
their ninnies get rigid
'n look pretty bold
it's a common reaction
that makes an attraction
whenever it's cold
'n all of the fellas
they wish they could bite
on the cute little nuggets
the local girls are showin' off tonite
you know i think it serves 'em right
you know i think it serves 'em right
you know i think it serves 'em right
you know i think it serves 'em right
and it's
wet t - shirt time again
i know you want someone to show you some tit !
big ones !
wet ones !
big wet ones !
