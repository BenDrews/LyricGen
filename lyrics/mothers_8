i felt alive for a little while
but when i died
i had the time to notice
i was crushed by the weight of my own ego
but never honest enough to say it
i felt your love for a little while
but never had the guts
to give myself up
i said that i could be just what you wanted
as if i could ever keep a promise
as if i could ever keep a promise
you have eyes in every room
but you won't see me , you won't see me
you won't see me walk away
once i was
more than just a song to play
on your haunted tape
i don't want to be away
could have sworn
i heard you laughing in the doorway
i don't like myself when i'm awake
i don't like myself
when i'm awake
