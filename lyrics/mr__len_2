bank on the best
who drop it like an acme anvil
and freeze your chest to leave you breathing ill
how about jean and a fifth of nyquil in ya
grilling my perimeter
niggas exposed , see who pulls and falls , i ain't feeling ya
told y'all , i'm proof two - oh - oh
hotter than the diaphragms of twenty bitches backstage with chlamydia
snot - nosed punks , i'm that deranged chick
no range , no whip - - same for all the niggas i hang with
i'm a pen - holding , gold - rocking , 40 - swigging nigga
figure me out , maneuver me , sue me for getting into ya
sting like another word for the cops
zen master , classes held on the wax
your homework is playback
pro - black and anti - bitch , anti - snitch
mic cords is whips , trains is fours , fives , and sixes
and no benz and fuck friends , i'll be the last chick standing
wait , nah , fuck that - - bring at least one man in
say what , nigga ?
speak up , i can't hear you
look me in my eyes if you feel that i should see you
still drunk from last night
buzzing off my last fight
what if i turned around and quickly whipped your ass ?
i'd be right
jean , bench - press strength is a million and five strong
no henchmen , yes - niggas to survive on
investment figures is little to ride on
no nine - to - five , a nine to get live on
live onstage like a shante roxanne
with men and some rock band
mosh pits , cocks in hands
i'm a mic addict , type dramatical life
high gramatical status
non - compatible , non grata
no prada , no baby father
out of place like road rules insider
won't spill bottles of vodka
i'm prejudiced , bastard
rule , kill you with tender service
eat the food and pass gas in your closed casket
i'll get my ass kicked and talk shit while it's happening
heard shots , run to the side that niggas clapped in
i been punk , been drunk , been drugged but fuck it
now i fight back
you could pull the vinyl from your backpack
( oh right , that's your gat ; oh right , i forgot )
my type is wrong , weight is thick
height depends if i've been stumbling all night long
write for songs like i'm hyped to hold the mic for throngs
gather round , rip down stages
just to prove points
made minimum wages for joints
and still blaze your boys
stay poised when i'm flipping on your toy bullshit
no chips , just shit in your face
hate your moms , take your arms
make you watch all the rape scenes from oz
round of applause when you bound to fall and get tossed
your high - floss , high gloss and mega high beams
strange it seems , your daylight still ain't seeing me
new york representative , i told you before
and the only way i like it is raw , no pause
