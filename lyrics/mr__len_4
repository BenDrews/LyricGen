mr. len : me and el did this record , and it was the first of its kind for that time. and it got mixed reactions. you finish funcrusher , and people are like , yo , the lyrics on that record are so crazy. and then we said , our next record doesn't have lyrics at all
sameoldshawn : i can see how that would catch some people off guard
ml : yeah. every now and then , i would take over 89.9 back in the day , and there was a caller that would call up , and he'd be like , " len , you still owe me money back on that record , cause i bought that album and there was no lyrics on it at all. " he was like , " i was not pleased. "
but i'm happy to say , it did start a trend. producers don't get the same kind of attention that an emcee would. even if producers have beef , there's no way to really get at another producer in a beat. it's like , " this kick is for you , bitch ! " it's just not gonna happen
so there's a lot of focus that's taken away from the music because people focus in so much on what's being said. so after us , you had the spinna album , bbe did petestrumentals , then of course the biggest one would be donuts. and dj shadow and all these cats had their joints. i thought it was dope , you know ?
but it's funny. working on the ep i just finished , when i told sussio i'm gonna do an instrumental record , he automatically thought of donuts. and i was like , " dude , i started this ! why would you think i'm gonna make a donuts record ? " so it's funny how it's evolved , or how the shift in thinking of what an instrumental record was or is. it went from what we did , from people not being totally happy , to , " hey man , if your record ain't like donuts... "
