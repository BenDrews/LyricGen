dirty concrete
sky blue dreams grown
crooked smile with some 501 jeans on
mama i made it look
i used to scribble rhymes in my green power ranger book
took the bus with the crips and the pretty boys
now i look plush when i dip through my city boy
the yougins crown me an o.g
and all the big homies super proud of me
the haters , they still mad as fuck
it's our time , just ask problem and bad lucc
fuel efficient thug dipping through the diamond lane
call me " murs " cause you marks usually rhyme the same
game spitting since way back
still in inglewood with the 9 - 6 cadillac
and no i never signed to battle axe
i built an empire off of spitting these battle raps
take one hand wave that shit in the air
and if it's playing on the radio then we don't care
we living in a world that don't play fair
so if you love the underground let me hear you say " yeah ! "
yeah , now everybody keep your hands up
if you know the mainstream can't stand us
it's our time to stand up
living life free , never sitting in hand cuffs
love it all , trap rap to back pack
listen to lecrae and jack off to cat stacks
now how's that for conflicted homie ?
sick and twisted , i admit we should kick it homie
i don't smoke weed or blow trees
undefeated in my fantasy though in both leagues
and fantasy is my reality
it ain't happened yet then that's just a technicality
i manifest my ism
rest in peace to the homies camu tao and przm
and i made my decision
so you featherweight fucks get no wins in my division
{spanish}
and when i win a grammy like pun it's for la raza
a mix between a cholo and a rasta
grew up on good weed with no pops in the casa
third verse is a long time to listen to him
especially when they ain't saying nothing to get you through 'em
the hard times , man they come and go
but not the underground dudes like me and one.be.lo
and now it's my time to run the show
without felt or my brother 9th wonder though
no shade , everybody need the sun to grow
and my time underground has been wonderful
