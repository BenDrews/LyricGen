mr. len : my take on the rawkus thing was totally different
sameoldshawn : but there was almost no room for that because el's response was so big
ml : but it was also really fucking cool. it sounded dope , you know ? but my approach to it was , when someone owes you money - - and to me , the evidence was little johnny - - you owe me money , but you know that you messed around with my money. so now you're in my pocket. so i get to come up with this idea of , i'm gonna make a record of nothing but beats , and you're gonna put it out. and on top of it , now , when it sells , you're gonna have to pay me even more money. as a producer , at that time at least , there wasn't many vehicles for you to express and for you to get something released
but the thing is , now , i can work as a collection agency , and we can make a deal where , you gotta pay me in increments. and all of this adds up. but like i said , there's no way to look back on it now and say , that's what it would have been or whatever. but it wasn't that extreme of being mouth - fucked by a nazi
