sameoldshawn : if you had to put it into words , what part did everyone play in the group ?
mr. len : well , you know what ? if you're a real fan of the group and you buy everybody's records - - notice i said " buy , " don't just download my shit - - you can hear what everyone did. el is that weird - - i won't say " weird , " because " weird " is such a stupid word - - but it's that edge where it feels kinda industrial. i pride myself on being the funk. and juss is that i'm - just - right - on - the - edge - of - falling - off of just being absolutely fucking crazy. it's mostly because he's a visual artist. most of what he's done is based in that. he's off whatever. and he was older than me and el anyway
i have no problem that a lot of the attention goes to el. my problem has always been , people act like i didn't do shit , you know what i'm saying ? now , when you hear everybody's records separately , it should be kind of obvious. there's a certain kind of swing that's not in el's music that's 100% in mine , the same way there's a certain kind of industrial sound , and there's an element that what you heard in co flow that's not in my music. so it's pretty obvious
