drunk driving on a wednesday
with three bitches and an mpv
half a gallon of georgi porgi
and cranberry that's the pop
peel - off passion , a recipe for terror
we mix them shits together
and then we having orgies
we live this life forever
we never gonna stop
you with us lemme hear you scream
huzzah !
straight shots of vodka , straight shots of vodka
slamdance with white hens from czechoslovakia
bank like a mobster , cutlass impostor
shoot a bati boy in 'im head like a rasta
what's my name bitch ? ( mr exquire )
don't forget the muthafuckin , without that it's nothin
i bring the ruckus , these niggas suck dick
they rap like some fags with they ballsacks tucked in
damn my whole shit slow
god i ain't forget you
my nigga i ain't trippin just been goin through some issues
back to the basics
timbs' loosely laced in
on my '98 shit , do it just like jay did from brooklyn
live from the 7 - 1 - 8 where
these niggas bust ya grape quick with no hesitation
mind in the matrix is sorta oceania like
slumber party calling all the demons that i can't invite
liver shrivel quickly when your sippin on that poison
your pussy's so good my whole squad should enjoy it
always twittin bout your grindin , nigga that's annoying
publicist asked me what's my gimmick , i said " going in "
man you only live once , might as well throw a fit
snuff the shit outta hipster rappers for the fuck of it
live by the mantra : live live , die never so
in other words , the real legacy breathes forever
industry niggas think i'm nut - shrunk fuck them
smut bitch , got some nice lips come and suck dick
thumbs up big gun buck doing dumb shit
life going up feeling like my guts eruptin
stumbling , stuck cause my whole life crumbling
( it must suck to be him , it must suck to be him )
him = me fuck this whole henny bottle empty
fuck til my dick is feeling empty
metrocards , don't got no hemi
i ain't got a charger
charge card , d - class credit i'm retard
flow like dirty , raw like willy dynamite
trying to ignite a revolution with the shit i write
me and my niggas gonna take the world over
me and my niggas gonna take the world over
no bucks to oprah , never see me nervous
abuhbuhbuh i fucked up on purpose
disclaimer : i didn't make this song to promote the sale of alcohol
hardly , uhh can't think of the word right now
feel like my brain is fucked up from drinking alcohol
but uh , the distribution and shit , i didn't write this song for that
i wrote this song because i like drinking nigga , and i be drunk
that's why i wrote this song , hahaha fuck you
