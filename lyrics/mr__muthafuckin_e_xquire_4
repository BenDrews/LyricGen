is it playing ?
oh , oh , oh , oh
na , na , na , na , na ( x5 )
igh !
kiss my ass in case you get this , get the kitchen supplies
dishes , washers , wishing water was delicious as wine
well aware of when and where and who nigga did the crime
digits , smidgets , you know numbers tell the viciousest lies
picture pigeons could fly , vision penguins with fins
pitch a pilot to air soon , schooling fishes to swim
i can't fall for the offer , off of general p
gentlemen , i'm a gentleman warning generally
justify your love
justify the blood
once you find your love
don't get lost
a fortune cookie told me it's three routes
self destruction and self actualization
the others just a quirky maze when you're driven insane by your imagination
that plain shit , same shit that always make your plane shift
from a higher plane to an off kilter course
an erroneous maze where you can't shift
you caught your demons with the same lips
that you kiss your mama with , suck vaginas with
i was feeling honest , my honesty just a bunch of promises that i can't keep
honestly i really love all y'all
but y'all make me feel like y'all hate me
same conundrum jesus faced , but i don't believe in that fairy tale
reality's too real , how you look me in the face
shit , i really gave my soul to y'all , i believed in everything you said
i believe in everything you say , never really even fucking talk
and i toss and turn behind my bed
and i toss and turn inside my head
and i tossed my turn , switch one vice for the heist of another
i fucked thirty bitches when i would've got drunk
i told my niggas that i changed but , umm umm
