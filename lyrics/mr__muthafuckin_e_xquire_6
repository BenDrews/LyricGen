beer goggles , fear nada
my tears dry slow
used to stay up 'til 1am
just to watch the apollo
used to be scared to sleep
my mother might be dead when i woke
reminiscin' , heavy visions
gave me chills while i wrote
parasuco's , late night
ironing my school clothes
cut party , bumpin' next
" baby getting' too close "
we was only humpin'
i was suckin' titties then
then shit got serious
all my niggas hustlin'
i was broke as fuck
my best friend was gettin' money
2.5 had the porsche
the gs , we was stuntin'
played my little songs in his range
we was frontin'
young , totin' guns just for fun
never bust 'em
hypnotic and hennessy
enemies , we jumped them
rumbling in the jungle
while we stumblin'
wondering , what we done
to become hunted
jumped in the devil's cauldron
with the dumplings
from then , my only function been malfunction
( rhythmic gibberish )
my dick floatin' in the bubble bath
plottin' out my future
reflectin' on my past
livin' the now , cause the now is perfect
you can't spoil now
the just then , she took off her towel
gave me head like she worship me
like we was married in a past life
like she was readin' me my last rites
gift and a curse , it's your worst
usurped in inertia
your persistent peril
to quench your thirst for nirvana
condoms and sewer water , filled with regrets
i moved and put no furniture in my crib
suffocated by my success
my destiny sweats
skewing my vision , ?
fuel my indecision
i ain't dissin' , i'm just venting
fuck that nigga
that whole shit was my fault
for deferring from my mission
tell my niggas , never count my money
tell these leechin' ass bitches
stay the fuck from me
tell my ogs i love them
never doubt my judgement
i got some things in my head
that i can't discuss with them
and that's hard
bombarded by bombs
they can blow your ass apart
my moms got cancer , told me when i got off tour
and it put in perspective what was most important
with 'em chasin'
the fuckin' ? that i'm caught in
deals with satan
the same shit i was avoiding
became the same shit i turned around and deemed important
i need my soul
badly eatin' at my sanity
my inner sanctum's being sacrificed for vanity
see , i'm forgettin' who i am
or who i planned to be
and all my niggas ain't no help
they just as scared as me
remember 'fore ? , swore we'd never change , y'all
now we all afraid to talk
but got the same thoughts
perplexin' how you can have everything you want
but at the same time have nothin' at all
i don't need nobody's approval
