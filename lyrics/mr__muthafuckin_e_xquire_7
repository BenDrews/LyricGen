schools train people to be ignorant with style
they give you the equipment that you need to be a functional ignoramus , american schools do not equip you to deal with things like logic
they don’t give you criteria by which to judge between good and bad in any meaning or format
and they prepare you to be a usable victim for a military industrial complex that needs man power
as long as your just smart enough to do a job
and just dumb enough to swallow what they feed you
you’re going to be alright
but if you go beyond on that
you’re going to have these great doubts that give you stomach problems , headaches , make you want to go out and do something else
so i believe schools mechanically and very specifically
try and breed out any hint of creative thought in the kids that are coming up
