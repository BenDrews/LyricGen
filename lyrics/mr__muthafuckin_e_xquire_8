i kissed her on a chubby cheek , we fell in love in three days
i bit her bottom lip and bled , i licked the blood off her face
digital watch with no time on it , it's my time
her naked body , have my mind on it
my naked mind fucked the soul that we ain't never touch
her ass wasn't even fat , she had a flat butt but she was cold as fuck
curly medusa , i'm sprung , somewhat freezing up
we opened the wound at least she cut , but i don't give a fuck
formless immortal , flashbacks in the puddle like a portal
girls sayin' i'm dark skinned , so i wasn't cute
ignorance is gravity , shangri - la was found , but god gaffled me
and strapped me to the ground , i'm on my damn knees
usurped then inertia , i'm drunk , now i'm rambling
but if you sat and think that shit apart , it all would make sense
tomcat and jerry , mouse will chase you 'round the house
you ran in your hole , i follow right behind you when i dug you out
these bitches don't deserve me , these niggas don't deserve you
ain't into the esoteric shit but you could be my oshun
hot air balloon , you think i gassed you , it's natural
your smile's still on my face , your aura's floating 'round my room
i really been too hard here
and it's really feelin' weird
no , i never meant to hurt you
now i'm 'lone , and i'm scared
bought them cherry raindrops
and a pine and a yen ?
something , something , ? good
and alone and i'm scared
i don't really wanna argue
i don't have too many fears
no , i never meant to hurt you
i'm a learn in the end
end , end , end
fin , fin , fin
close your eyes , spread your thighs
i'mma make you bust it wide
close your eyes , spread your thighs
i'mma make you bust it wide
i watch you need that nigga , fuck that nigga
the same shit , she don't love that nigga
but chasing 'round you pretendin' brand new beginnings
and now it's the ending and we've been 'round and 'round
back and forth , you're up and down
same shit , another day
same shame , a different play , yeah , it's rainin' anyway
i met her on a wednesday
i fucked her on a friday , we fell in love on a saturday
we fell in love in a back alley
a daddy's girl , but her back tatted
i kissed her on the spine and i kissed her thighs
i almost licked her ass , but she started to cry
it's different shit , manipulator
looked her in the eyes and i feel sedated
never been around all this bullshit
you textin' at your phone every time i hit
you're crying , but you love it though
you're dying , but i love it though
goddamn , you almost drank my soul
goddamn , i almost lost control
perfect couple , bad timing
