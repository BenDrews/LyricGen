i woke up this mornin'
feelin' like that nigga
feelin' like that nigga
feelin' like that nigga
man my life is roses , all my jewels is rose gold
pimpin' on another level , i don't fuck with broke hoes
smooth player , dark fade
making sure my part straight
mac daddy , clean specs
bitch i don't need no dark shades
i woke up this mornin' , feelin' like that nigga
first i brush my jibbs , face the man in the mirror
maybe i'm a narcisist
i'm suffering from narcissism , that carpe diem
sipping champagne in the apartment , having a menagin'
open eyes on my goods , keep yo lean , i keep my woods
direspect i'll make a scene , fuck with niggas in my hood
everybody running wild , a hundred mouths running foul
gettin' drunk , puffin loud , nigga i don't fuck with y'all
if i wasn't with mercedes i'd be fucking keisha
right up on the project roof , we call it pebble beach
i use to play the benches and watch the players ball
damn time flies because the tables turn and now niggas gotta watch me floss
i bumped into barry weiss like , " what's up , my nigga ? "
he said , " you exquire , right ? oh , you next up my nigga "
critics try to write me off but hold up , fuck them niggas
heard rumors of my demise but somehow i got bigger
ask me how i'm feelin'
nigga how you feelin' ?
i'm feelin' like that nigga , feelin' like that nigga
like my reach got longer , like my arms got strengther
yea i made that shit up but fuck it i'm that nigga
i don't drink no 40's , i don't fuck with liquor
but i will cop some bottles just to shit on niggas
just to get these hoes and to fuck these strippers
i'mma hit it in the bathroom , i ain't gon' tip her
just the same ol' nigga in a different location
from the bottom now we up and we ain't on no drake shit
shout my cousin goldie glo because he told me that i got it
do this for my nigga los and my whole fuckin' projects nigga
