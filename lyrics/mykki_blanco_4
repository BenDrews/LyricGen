popping pills this molly heat
and they're rising on their feet
take some xans to come down
now i'm feeling dead
popping pills this molly heat
and they're rising on their feet
take some xans to come down
now i'm feeling dead
short change that gram
it girls and socialites , white powder in their hands
getting twisted , they hella lifted , they asking 'bout them xans
trouble making these baby faces , i'm blunted with some man
asking me about poetry and i wanna leave but i can't
body high like a thousand miles up in the sky , goddamn
he using words i never heard , i'm looking at my friend
he macking deep and he tryna creep on that black girl wearing vans
they blasting nelly and missy elliott like high school never ends
like high school never ends
like high school never ends
like high school never ends

popping pills this molly heat

take some xans to come down
now i'm feeling dead
up on this roof
breaking diesel , i'm feeling evil , rich kids got the best views
the whole city looks so pretty , i'm sorry 'bout being rude
everybody got wet hair cause they just came from the pool
they kissing but i'm missing out , yo homie , it's cool
getting texts i don’t wanna get and i’m writing back like fuck you
buzz killa , yo nothing's realer , i'm so fucking confused
you say that you want love but then go fuck other dudes
treating me like you don't need me , i guess a nigga old news
so hazy , real slim shady , i can't find my shoes
i can't find my shoes
i can't find my shoes , shit
