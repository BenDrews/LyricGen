i'm a political refugee
that's how the fuck i felt
birds for the summer
hummers for the runners
candy on the paint
nine for the thunder
throw a couple of hundreds
fishing on the fishtail
with big money , cash money everywhere
high roller , shot caller , big boss
original , real nigga from the start
head hunting , price on a nigga tab
hit ‘em up for playing with a nigga mail
say i’m better than beethoven
to the beat that i rap over
stay outta that medicine cabinet
yeah , that what they told me
giving us piss tests , cause we stay rolling
and know a nigga act better than a .45 caliber pistol when they loaded
they penalize us , tryna slow us down
they constantly fucking us up
that's why we’re buck wild
call me porch monkey , call me jigaboo
when you know you wanna fuck my woman and eat my barbecue
how the fuck you wanna watch my house
but don’t wanna live on my street
the ape man taught tarzan - - how the fuck you better than me ?
rap , i run that rock , and got a jump shot
who we got that black wife up in that white house
i took my lick and didn’t sell out
i was in the bing , i didn’t bail out
hoping motherfucker run and fail out
back to the top from the jail house
lace ‘em up , tie ya shoe
catch a cut , you know what pressure do
who out chea fucking with me , huh ? tell me that
i’m bout to drop that shit , where my pamper at ?
try to answer that , or give me my mantle back
i bury you cockroaches , shoulda left me where i was at
you done made that fucking bed
you done built this fucking castle
buckwheat and his friend alfalfa
couldn't do nothing with this little rascal
i wonder licking retarded
yeah nigga what the hell
talking baby business , yeah
yeah bitch , dumb shit
don’t be fucking with me
cause you won't get off easy
i feel just like drew brees
when they kick off football season
how i cut the ref , you can’t stop from bleeding
rappers betta leave me alone
if they gon’ keep on breathing
now keep on starving and i’mma gonna keep on eating
and you keep on sucking , and i’mma keep on skeeting
nigga , you gon be the one bussing or be the one fleeing
nigga better keep on trucking
you don't want no fucking trouble this evening
uh , ain't it crazy how shit be
thats why i flush it
i got the tommy gun with the drum
thats percussion
i just popped a couple pain pills , self destruction
i made something out of nothing , thanks for nothing
i pistol whip you pussies , knock her out robitussin
ran up in your house , killed everybody , no discussion
rep , that muthafucking red flag like a russian
yeah , look , i told her baby i’m a thrasher
we kissed , i lit her ass up than i ashed her
no hard feelings , no card dealing , but i shuffle my queen
duffle bag too heavy to carry to the car
my mary in a jar
i’m food , i let the haters add a little salt
thats cool , i do it for all the niggas that try
and all the bitches i’ve fucked , and all my niggas that died
