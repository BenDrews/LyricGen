young money cash money
fast life , one night
we did it all in one night
same night , it’s one night
we moved it all in one night
the same night , over night
took a flight , did it all in one night
fuck a nigga bitch , all in one night
took another trip , all in one night
split a nigga’s shit , all in one night
overnight , ship the same night
pay the price , the same night
hit him up , leave it since sunny bright
he rolled the dice , so he paid the price
i’m still the nigga off of tchoupitoulas
i’m still funky like hustle new
just don’t let ‘em take the call from cuba
you saw me on the news but you know what i do
i was down , and nigga i don’t fuck around
cuz i’m pound for pound and i’m blow for blow
got another year for ’98 , ‘99
been gone since ‘04 , got out on parole
shit , rappin’ this man and nigga i don’t just kid , nigga got my spot
still hard like a locked up cock
simple but the same with a locked up pac
come and behold , they open the gates so
brace yourself big , about to shake up the block
can’t just lock up the prince of the south
came the time right you didn’t fuck with me
put your mold on , slot ‘em , cold ‘em , hold ‘em
my shoulder gets cold in blood
i brought the motherfucker like it’s ape charge
i’m high enough to slide between the water
i’d give it to you but nah they don’t get it
i’m shovelin’ the gloves but hands don’t fit it
take up a video and later get to know ‘em
get the motherfucker for preaching to levy
i taught that detainer. artist , painter
sweep that finger , bang ‘er
cuz your motherfuckin’ head i’mma blow off
and your body hit the floor and the carpet stained
have the nigga that you won a star should you go to war
but you’re more than a gruesome painter
when it come to rappin’ get some lollics and then put ‘em all together and use ‘em
aha , i’m a fool with a tool , i’mma beast in the street
put the fucker on the door but the law got feelin’ to the riddle lemme kill ‘em to the beat
fuckin’ records , i’mma stab ‘em with them repper
get the phone with the chrome and i’m lone with the bone
god dammit , i grudge when i bust ‘em
three hoes with some dudes , they’re alone in the room
better off gettin’ hit by a chain , ran over by a truck or fall of a house
dare to fuck with me then my work , choke me on yourself ‘til you pass out
and the fuck i don’t get no shits , and you son of a bitch , you’d better watch your step
hey , but the microphone’s stickin’ out your ass and the goddamn corvette ‘round your neck
bitch !
