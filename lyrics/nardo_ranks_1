here's my ghetto story
been in hell , through the fire
now gonna take it higher
here's my survival story
so many reasons to sing this
now we got the keys to the kingdom
i remember those days when hell was my home
when me and mama bed was a big piece of foam
an mi never like bathe and my hair never comb
when mama gone a work me go street go roam
i remember when danny dem take me snow cone
and make him licke bredda dem kick up jerome
i remember when we visit dem wid pure big stone
an the boy danny pop out something weh full chrome
i remember when we run fatta get him knee blown
and mi best friend richie get , two inna him dome
i remember so the avenue tun inna war zone
an mickey madda fly him out 'cuz she get a loan
but , mickey go to foreign and go tun al capone
mek whole heap a money and seen in our own
now a we a lock the city and that is well known
yesterday mikey call me pan mi phone , me say mikey
we get da kingdom , dem outta luck now
mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a don't know
we have whole heap a extra clip 'cause we nuh broke no
rah , rah , rah , rah
we got the kingdom so we have to make way
we take it from the bottom to the top , baby
and now the whole community can live greatly
rah , rah , rah , rah
i remember those days when we was dead broke
and i could barely find a dollar for a token
hop in the train just to get where i'm going
hobos after me and runnin' like i'm smokin'
remember those days when i went to bed hungry
all i ever ate was white rice and honey
big dreams in my head empty my tummy
might crack a smile but ain't nothin' funny
i remember playin' over needles in the streets
everywhere i go , a man want some part of me
dirty , dirty those hookas and hoes on 11th avenue
sellin' bodies for dough
remember cryin' sayin' that will never be me
gonna make it someday , gotta be somebody
say mommy , dont worry , it's just you and me
but one day we will get out of this misery , hey
we get da kingdom , dem outta luck now
mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a don't know
we have whole heap a extra clip 'cause we nuh broke no
rah , rah , rah , rah
we got the kingdom so we have to make way
we take it from the bottom to the top , baby
and now the whole community can live greatly
rah , rah , rah , rah
