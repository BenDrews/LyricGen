yah , say roro , you know what it is , right ?
who is rickey wayne ? : the mixtape
ya feel me ? yah , ahem
first , let me hop out the muh fuckin' porsche
i don't want her if that ass don't sit like a horse
i be ballin' on these niggas , got me feelin' like sports
dash got so much wood i could build me a fort
ain't too many things i ain't done yet
i'm the king of this shit , crown by the toilet
i'm just barely gettin' started , you already upset
got a tiger as a pet , i just took him to the vet
homie , i be makin' hits , i'm the rap derek jeter
let your bitch ride on me like she was on the feeder
if the pussy ain't good then i probably won't feed her
lil homie , you can keep her cause i really don't need her
i ain't worried 'bout features , homeboy , you's a peon
toilet seat ass nigga , man , i swear you gettin' peed on
man , my jewelry so cold , i walk around with the heat on
my alarm clock set , just in case they wanna sleep on , ya dig ?
i'm a full - time player , hoppin' out in alligator
sippin' lean and now and later , homie , i'll annihilate ya
if you think you wanna battle , you gon' have to pay some paper
i just hit her and i quit her , i would never ever date her
it's a shame how i'm barely gettin' love in the city
travel to another town , you can bet they fuckin' with me
i be killin' this shit , pray to god they forgive me
they said , " when you blow up , don't forget me " , man
i been on fire ever since they made the lighter
my boys will pull up on ya , homie , i ain't talkin' diapers
walk into your function , on point , i'm like a sniper
my girl bad like dej loaf so don't try her
flexin' all you want but homeboy , you ain't ready
ten times sharper than michael myers' machete
been about the money , i ain't worried 'bout the fame
'bout to have everybody sayin' , " who is rickey wayne ? "
that me...
