ayo , what's up , what's up ?
let's keep it real , son , count this money
you know what i'm sayin' ? yeah yeah
ayo , put the grants over there in the safe
you know what i'm sayin' ?
‘cause we spendin' these jacksons
the washingtons go to wifey , you know how that go
i'm sayin' that's what this is all about right
clothes , bankrolls , and hoes
you know what i'm sayin' ?
yo , then what man , what ? !
visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
fuck who's the baddest , a person's status depends on salary
and my mentality is money - orientated
i'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
‘cause yeah , we were beginners in the hood as five percenters
but somethin' must've got in us , ‘cause all of us turned to sinners
now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in san quentin
others , such as myself , are tryin' to carry on tradition
keepin' this schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
even though we know , somehow we all gotta go
but as long as we leavin' thievin'
we'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
so , until that day we expire and turn to vapors
me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
keepin' it real , packin' steel , gettin' high
‘cause life's a bitch and then you die
life's a bitch and then you die
that's why we get high
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die
that's why we puff lye
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
i woke up early on my born day ; i'm 20 , it's a blessin'
the essence of adolescence leaves my body , now i'm fresh and
my physical frame is celebrated ‘cause i made it
one quarter through life , some godly - like thing created
got rhymes 365 days annual , plus some
load up the mic and bust one , cuss while i pus from
my skull , ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein , money maintain
don't go against the grain , simple and plain
when i was young at this i used to do my thing hard
robbin' foreigners , take they wallets , they jewels and rip they green cards
dipped to the projects , flashin' my quick cash
and got my first piece of ass , smokin' blunts with hash
now it's all about cash in abundance
niggas i used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
i switched my motto ; instead of sayin' , " fuck tomorrow ! "
that buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
once i stood on the block , loose cracks produce stacks
i cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
time is illmatic , keep static like wool fabric
pack a 4 - matic to crack your whole cabbage
life's a bitch and then you die
that's why we get high
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die
that's why we puff lye
‘cause you never know when you're gonna go
life's a bitch and then you die
delete me ! me too !
