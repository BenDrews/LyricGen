{it's yours} whose world is this ?
the world is yours , the world is yours
it's mine , it's mine , it's mine—whose world is this ?
it's mine , it's mine , it's mine—whose world is this ?
the world is yours , the world is yours
it's mine , it's mine , it's mine—whose world is this ?
i sip the dom p , watchin' gandhi 'til i'm charged , then
writin' in my book of rhymes , all the words past the margin
behold the mic i'm throbbin' , mechanical movement
understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
the thief's theme ; play me at night , they won't act right
the fiend of hip - hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
the mind activation , react like i'm facin'
time like pappy mason , with pens i'm embracin'
wipe the sweat off my dome , spit the phlegm on the streets
suede timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
whether cruisin' in a six cab or montero jeep
i can't call it ; the beats make me fallin' asleep
i keep fallin' , but never fallin' six feet deep
i'm out for presidents to represent me ( say what ? )
i'm out for presidents to represent me ( say what ? )
i'm out for dead presidents to represent me
{it's yours} whose world is this ?
the world is yours , the world is yours
it's mine , it's mine , it's mine — whose world is this ?
it's mine , it's mine , it's mine — whose world is this ?
the world is yours , the world is yours
it's mine , it's mine , it's mine — whose world is this ?
to my man ill will
god bless your life
to my peoples throughout queens
god bless your life
i trip , we box up crazy bitches
aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
beef with housing police , release scriptures that's maybe hitler's
yet i'm the mild , money - gettin' style , rollin' foul
the versatile , honey - stickin' , wild , golden child
dwellin' in the rotten apple , you get tackled
or caught by the devil's lasso , shit is a hassle
there's no days for broke days
we sell it , smoke pays , while all the old folks pray
to jesús , soakin' their sins in trays of holy water
odds against nas are slaughter
thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
my strength , my son , the star will be my resurrection
born in correction , all the wrong shit i did
he'll lead a right direction
how you livin' ? large , a broker charge , cards are mediocre
you flippin' coke or playin' spit , spades , and strip poker ?
{it's yours} whose world is this ?
the world is yours , the world is yours
it's mine , it's mine , it's mine — whose world is this ?
it's mine , it's mine , it's mine — whose world is this ?
the world is yours , the world is yours
it's mine , it's mine , it's mine — whose world is this ?
i'm the young city bandit , hold myself down single - handed
for murder raps , i kick my thoughts alone , get remanded
born alone , die alone ; no crew to keep my crown or throne
i'm deep by sound alone , caved inside , 1 , 000 miles from home
i need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
tryin' to maintain , i flip , fill the clip to the tip
picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
and i'm amped up , they locked the champ up
even my brain's in handcuffs
headed for indiana , stabbin' women like the phantom
the crew is lampin' , big willie style
check the chip - toothed smile , plus i profile wild
stash loot in fly clothes , burnin' dollars to light my stoge
walk the blocks with a bop , checkin' dames
plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today
{it's yours} whose world is this ?
the world is yours , the world is yours
it's mine , it's mine , it's mine — whose world is this ?
it's mine , it's mine , it's mine — whose world is this ?
the world is yours , the world is yours
it's mine , it's mine , it's mine — whose world is this ?
