i call it , yeah , yeah
for my brothers with daughters , i call this
for my brothers with daughters , i call this
for my brothers with daughters , i call this
for my brothers with daughters
i saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
who locked up , first i regretted it , then caught my rage
like , how could i not protect her from this awful phase ?
never tried to hide who i was , she was taught and raised
like a princess , but while i'm on stage i can't leave her defenseless
plus she's seen me switchin' women , pops was on some pimp shit
she heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
so if her husband is a gangster , can't be mad , i'll love him
never , for her i want better , homie in jail – dead that
wait 'til he come home , you can see where his head's at
niggas got game , they be tryna live
he seen your mama crib , plus i'm sure he know who your father is
although you real , plus a honest kid
don't think i'm slow , i know you probably had that chronic lit
you seventeen , i got a problem with it
she looked at me like i'm not the cleanest father figure
but she rockin' with it
for my brothers with daughters , i call this
for my brothers with daughters , i call this
not sayin' that our sons are less important
for my brothers with daughters , i call this
for my brothers with daughters , i call this
not sayin' that our sons are less important
this morning i got a call , nearly split my wig
this social network said : " nas , go and get your kid ! "
she's on twitter , i know she ain't gon' post no pic
of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit , right ?
her mother cried when she answered
said she don't know what got inside this child's mind , she planted
a box of condoms on her dresser , then she instagram'd it
at this point i realized i ain't the strictest parent
i'm too loose , i'm too cool with her
should've drove more time to school with her
i thought i dropped enough jewels on her
took her from private school , so she can get a balance
to public school , they're too nurture teen talents
they grow fast , one day she's your little princess
next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this ?
they say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
god gets us back , he makes us have precious little girls
for my brothers with daughters , i call this
for my brothers with daughters , i call this
not sayin' that our sons are less important
for my brothers with daughters , i call this
for my brothers with daughters , i call this
not sayin' that our sons are less important
and i ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
but i just wanna see you dream up
i finally understand
it ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
nah , the way mothers feel for they sons
how fathers feel for they daughters
when he date , he straight , chip off his own papa
when she date , we wait behind the door with a sawed - off
‘cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters
love
