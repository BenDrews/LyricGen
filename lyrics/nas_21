where is he , the man who was just like me ?
i heard he was hidin' somewhere i can’t see
where is he , the man who was just like me ?
heard he was hidin' somewhere i can’t see
and i’m alone , and i realize that when i get home
i wanna talk to my red and my cherry
yes , i’m alone , and i realize when i get home
i wanna talk to my red and my cherry
i want someone who like the champagne i like , my a - alike
someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
she teach me how to live , she ain’t afraid of life
not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
she loves art , she ride out with me on my music tour
she like the herb's natural medicine , she cookin' good
she tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good
for real , the world so ill , yo i want a girl so real
who not after material wealth but get dough still
or maybe an educator , a lady with etiquette
who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
as long as there’s no selfishness
yes , as long as her love for the people is deep - rooted and evident
you can be easily recruited , you’re heaven - sent
your smile put me at ease
you’re the woman i need , but where is she ?

yes , i’m alone , and i realize when i get home
i wanna talk to my red and my cherry
i hate when people write me hostile texts
on account of my lifestyle’s perception
invade my personal life out of the question
what are they expectin' ? i be tryin' to reply and
they never suppose i get my quiet time in ?
they think forever i’m rollin' in dough , swimmin' in a pool of cash
god , wouldn’t they know or am i a fool or ass ?
i’m well known , got people comin' at me mad
i had to tell homes , i don’t keep a cell phone , my bad
i drag off the l and try to silence it
the noise in my head , the curse of the talented
strong communicator , vagabond
i’d gallivant around the equator , if that would get me off the radar
it’s so intense , i’m on my lilo & stitch
pour my pinot grigio and cris with some lime , what is this ?
an immaculate version of " me & my bitch " by biggie
with all respect 'cause you the only one that gets me
where is he , the man who was just like me ?
i heard he was hidin' somewhere i can’t see
where is he , the man who was just like me ?
heard he was hidin' somewhere i can’t see
and i’m alone , and i realize that when i get home
i wanna talk to my red and my cherry
yes , i’m alone , and i realize when i get home
i wanna talk to my red and my cherry
yeah , yeah , let’s pour some cherry wine
everything’s good , everything’s fine
yeah , yeah , we bring it every time
yeah , pour a little cherry wine
yeah , hey yo , salaam
yeah , i think they know the time
everything’s good , everything’s fine
yeah , pour a little cherry wine , yeah
life is good , life is good , yeah
life is good , no matter what , life is good
life is good , life is good , yeah
no matter what , life is good
