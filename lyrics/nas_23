all i need is one mic , one beat , one stage
one nigga front , my face on the front page
only if i had one gun , one girl and one crib
one god to show me how to do things his son did
pure , like a cup of virgin blood
mixed with 151 , one sip'll make a nigga flip
writin' names on my hollow tips , plottin' shit
mad violence , who i'm gon' body ? this hood politics
acknowledge it , leave bodies chopped up in garbages
seeds watch us , grow up and try to follow us
police watch us , roll up and try knockin' us
one knee i ducked , could it be my time is up ?
but my luck , i got up , the cop shot again
bus stop glass bursts , a fiend drops his heineken
ricochetin' between the spots that i'm hidin' in
blackin' out as i shoot back – fuck gettin' hit !
this is my hood , i'ma rep to the death of it
'til everybody come home , little niggas is grown
hoodrats , don't abortion your womb
we need more warriors soon
sent from the star , sun and the moon
in this life of police chases , street sweepers and coppers
stick - up kids with no conscience , leavin' victims with doctors
if you really think you ready to die , with 9's out
this is what nas is 'bout , nigga , the time is now
all i need is one mic
all i need is one mic
all i need is one mic
all i need is one mic
all i need is one blunt , one page and one pen
one prayer ; tell god forgive me for one sin
matter of fact , maybe more than one
look back at all the hatred against me – fuck all of them !
jesus died at age 33 , there's 33 shots
from twin glocks , there's 16 apiece , that's 32
which means one of my guns was holdin' 17
27 hit your crew , six went into you
everybody gotta die sometime , hope your funeral
never gets shot up , bullets tear through the innocent
nothin' is fair , niggas roll up , shootin' from wheelchairs
my heart is racin' , tastin' revenge in the air
i let this shit slide for too many years , too many times
now i'm strapped with a couple of mac's , too many 9's
if y'all niggas really with me , get busy , load up the semi's
do more than just hold it , explode the clip until you empty
there's nothin' in our way : they bust , we bust
they rush , we rush , lead flyin' , feel it ? i feel it in my gut
that we take these bitches to war , lie 'em down
‘cause we stronger now , my nigga , the time is now
all i need is one mic
all i need is one mic
all i need is one mic
all i need is one mic
all i need is one life , one try , one breath , i'm one man
what i stand for speaks for itself , they don't understand
don't wanna see me on top , too egotistical
talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
wonder what my secrets is
niggas'll move on you , only if they know what your weakness is
i have none – too late to grab guns
i'm blastin' ‘cause i'm a cool nigga
thought i wouldn't have that ass done ? fooled you niggas
what you call an infinite brawl , eternal souls clashin'
war gets deep , some beef is everlastin'
complete with thick scars
brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
drama , where does it start ?
you know the block was ill as a youngster
every night it was like a cop would get killed
body found in the dumpster
for real a hustler , purchased my range
niggas throwin' dirt on my name
jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain
bitches left me ‘cause they thought i was finished
shoulda knew she wasn't true
she came to me when her man caught a sentence
diamonds are blindin' , i never make the same mistakes
movin' with a change of pace
lighter load , see now the king is straight
swellin' my melon , ‘cause none of these niggas real
heard they were tellin' police , how can a kingpin squeal ?
this is crazy , i'm on the right track , i'm finally found
you need some soul - searchin' , the time is now
all i need is one mic
all i need is one mic
all i need is one mic
all i need is one mic
