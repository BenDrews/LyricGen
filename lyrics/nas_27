classic shit , timeless , forever , iconic
dj khaled !
a divine leader , shine brighter
bonita mami , meet a line sniffer
never , poetic rhyme writer , chiefer
ebony empress getter
celebrity apprentice a devil show
big up to africa , mexico
hennessy , margarita , venison eater
so dear spread 'em here , don't be actin' innocent either
dome me , relax me , it's only to the nasty
i'm just a phony assassin
a lot of niggas owe me , i'ma tax 'em
a lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and catholic
‘cause the rosary and gold flashy
just an attachment and accessory to my dress code
now everywhere all i see is pablo , esco
last time i checked i was still breathin'
my neck was still freezin'
now everybody got an escobar season
to every baby on the album cover existin'
this trend i was settin' , it came to fruition
i'm assistin' to push the culture forward
to all my ghost supporters , go support us
like a local black - owned grocery store
‘cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood
it's a dub on that , we get government aid
spend it at they stores , puttin' they kids through college
we need balance
so we can lease and own deeds in our projects
so i'm askin' gs to go in their pockets
the racial economic inequality , let's try to solve it
my signature fade with the bevel blade
that's a major key
i told her she smart and loyal , i like that
that's a major key
start a label , run it , sign yourself
that's a major key
what tony had on the table
it's like us , we a major key
still underestimated , every mistake a lesson
mercury retrograde , so if that planet spin backwards
up in the heavens maybe
it's effectin' back on niggas who don't be reppin' lately
i'm playin' chess with babies
niggas is nursery
niggas impersonatin' , rehearsin' me
nothin' like me , i'm the first of me
and that's quite certainly
so official , come get this issue , some women crazy
i like a woman to show me wisdom
these hoes easily convinced to pop their pussy
with a loaded pistol
y'all ain't meant to be played
says the brother with the signature fade
still paid , stackin' , new stash
went from hangin' with shooters and clappers
to computer hackers
check the fashion in monaco
gettin' ocean mist on my hstry hats
khaled called me when i was in album mode
so i put it on hold for the major key
my album done , niggas , wait and see
classic shit , timeless , forever , iconic
my signature fade with the bevel blade
that's a major key
i told her she smart and loyal , i like that
that's a major key
start a label , run it , sign yourself
that's a major key
what tony had on the table
it's like us , we a major key
