check me out , y'all
nasty nas in your area
about to cause mass hysteria
before a blunt , i take out my fronts
then i start to front ; matter of fact , i be on a manhunt
you couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
that's like malcolm x catching the jungle fever
king poetic ; too much flavor , i'm major
atlanta ain't brave - r , i'll pull a number , like a pager
‘cause i'm an ace when i face the bass
40 - side is the place that is giving me grace
now wait , another dose and you might be dead
and i'm a nike - head , i wear chains that excite the feds
and ain't a damn thing gonna change
i'm a performer , strange
so the mic warmer was born to gain
nas , why did you do it ? you know
you got the mad - phat fluid when you rhyme ; it's halftime
it's halftime
this is how it feel
check it out , how it feel
it's like that , you know it's like that
i got it hemmed , now you never get the mic back
when i attack , there ain't an army that could strike back
so i react never calmly on a hype track
i set it off with my own rhyme
‘cause i'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
i'm max like cassettes , i flex like sex
in your stereo sets , nas'll catch wreck
i used to hustle ; now all i do is relax and strive
when i was young i was a fan of the jackson 5
i drop jewels , wear jewels , hope to never run it
with more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
nasty nas has to rise , ‘cause i'm wise
this is exercise 'til the microphone dies
back in '83 i was an mc sparkin'
but i was too scared to grab the mics in the parks , and
kick my little raps ‘cause i thought niggas wouldn't understand
and now in every jam i'm the fuckin' man
i rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
i used to watch " chips " , now i load glock clips
i got to have it , i miss mr. magic
versatile , my style switches , like a faggot
but not bisexual ; i'm an intellectual
of rap i'm a professional , and that's no question , yo
these are the lyrics of the man
you can't near it , understand ?
‘cause in the streets i'm well - known , like the number man
am i in place with the bass and format ?
explore rap and tell me , " nas ain't all that. "
and next time i rhyme , i be foul
whenever i freestyle i see trial , niggas say i'm wild
i hate a rhyme - biter's rhyme
stay tuned , i assume ; the real rap comes at halftime
it's halftime
this is how it feel
check it out , how it feel
i got it going on , even flip a morning song
every afternoon , i kick half the tune
and in the darkness , i'm heartless , like when the narc's hit
word to marcus garvey ; i hardly sparked it
‘cause when i blast the herb , that's my word
i be slayin' them fast , doing this that and the third
but chill , pass the andre , and let's slay
i bag bitches up at john jay , and hit a matinee
putting hits on 5 - 0
‘cause when it's my time to go , i wait for god with the .44
and biters can't come near
and yo , go to hell to the foul cop who shot garcia
i won't plant seeds
don't need an extra mouth i can't feed
that's extra phillie change , more cash for damp weed
this goes out to manhattan , the island of staten
brooklyn and queens is living fat , and
the boogie down , enough props , enough clout
ill will , rest in peace ! yo , i'm out
