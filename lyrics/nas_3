freedom or jail , clips inserted , a baby's bein' born
same time my man is murdered ; the beginning and end
as far as rap go , it's only natural , i explain
my plateau , and also what defines my name
yeah , long live the idols , may they never be your rivals
'pac was like jesus , nas wrote the bible
now what you 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
no i.d. my mentor , now let the story begin
i used to print out nas' raps and tape 'em up on my wall
my niggas thought they was words , but it was pictures i saw
and since i wanted to draw , i used to read them in awe
then he dropped stillmatic , rocked the cleanest velour
fast forward , who'd a thought that i would meet him on tour
i'm earnin' stripes now , a nigga got adidas galore
backstage i shook his hand , let 'em know that he's the man
when he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
no time to soak up the moment though ‘cause i was in a jam
hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play
and i was strikin' out for months , 9th inning , feelin' fear
jeter under pressure , made the biggest hit of my career
but at first , that wasn't clear , niggas had no idea
dion called me when it dropped , sounded sad but sincere
told me nas heard your single and he hate that shit
said , " you the one , yo , why you make that shit ? "
i can't believe i let nas down
damn , my heart sunk to my stomach
i can't believe i let nas down
i got defensive on the phone
resentment was in my tone , fuck it
long live the idols , may they never be your rivals
'pac was like jesus , nas wrote the bible
now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
no i.d. my mentor , now let the story begin
i couldn't help but think that maybe i had made a mistake
i mean , you made " you owe me "
dog , i thought that you could relate
but while i shot up the charts
you mean tellin' me that i was not up to par
when i followed my heart
granted , my heart was tainted
by my mind that kept on sayin'
" where's the hits ? " you ain't got none
you know jay'll never put your album out without none
and , dog , you know how come
labels are archaic , formulaic with they outcome
they don't know , they just study the charts
me , i studied the shows , the fans , study they hearts
i had a feelin' i was killin' , and this music we were spillin' out
would change lives forever , fuck the label , put it out
friday night lights blew , that was classic number two
now it seemed as if the nas comparisons was comin' true
still no release date from the label—are they insane ?
gucc told me play the game to change the game
but on the way i let nas down
i got no one to blame
i'm a shame , i let nas down
but this is god's plan , you can never understand , fuck it
long live the idols , may they never be your rivals
'pac was like jesus , nas wrote the bible
now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
no i.d. my mentor , now let the story begin
i always believed in the bigger picture
if i could get them niggas to listen outside my core
then i can open up doors
reintroduce them to honesty , show 'em that they need more
the difference between the pretenders and the kendrick lamars , and so , i took the fall
like the son of the lord on the cross
dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
for the past decade
if i should pass , please let this be my last essay
therefore i write from the heart
apologies to og's for sacrificin' my art
but i'm here for a greater purpose
i knew right from the start
i'm just a man of the people , not above but equal
and for the greater good i walk amongst the evil
don't cry , mama , this the life i choose myself
just pray along the way that i don't lose myself
this is for the nigga that said that hip - hop was dead
i went to hell to resurrect it
how could you fail to respect it ?
letting nas down , i got the phone call
quietly i mourned , dog , i let nas down
yeah , and on this flight
may i never lose sight , fuck it
long live the idols , may they never be your rivals
'pac was like jesus , nas wrote the bible
now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
no i.d. my mentor , now let the story begin
