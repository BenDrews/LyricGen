freedom or jail , clips inserted , a baby's being born
same time a man is murdered ; the beginning and end
as far as rap go , it's only natural i explain
my plateau , and also , what defines my name
first it was nasty , but times have changed
ask me now , i'm the artist , but hardcore , my sign is for pain
i spent time in the game , kept my mind on fame
saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
saw my close friends shot , flatline , am i sane ?
that depends , carry mac - 10's to practice my aim
on rooftops , tape cd covers to trees
line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
street scriptures for lost souls , in the crossroads
to the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
to the big dogs living large , taking in light
pushing big toys , getting nice , enjoying your life
it's what you make it , suicide , few try to take it
belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
heaven and hell , rap legend , presence is felt
and of course n - a - s are the letters that spell - nas , nas
" nas is like " " life or death "
" i'm a rebel "
" my poetry's deep , i never fell "
" nas is like " " nas is like "
" half man half amazing "
" no doubt "
" nas is like… " earth , wind & fire , rims and tires
bulletproof glass , inside is the realest driver
planets in orbit , line 'em up with the stars
tarot cards , you can see the pharaoh nas
" nas is like… " iron mike , messiah type
before the christ , after the death
the last one left , let my cash invest in stock
came a long way from blastin' tec's on blocks
went from seiko to rolex , owning acres
from the projects with no chips , to large cake dough
dimes giving fellatio , siete zeros
bet my 9 spit for the pesos , but what's it all worth ?
can't take it with you under this earth
rich men died and tried , but none of it worked
they just rob your grave , i'd rather be alive and paid
before my number's called , history's made
some'll fall , but i rise , thug or die
making choices that determine my future under the sky
to rob , steal or kill , i'm wondering why
it's a dirty game , is any man worthy of fame ?
much success to you , even if you wish me the opposite
sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is
" nas is like " " life or death "
" i'm a rebel "
" my poetry's deep , i never fell "
" nas is like " " nas is like "
" half man half amazing "
" no doubt "
" nas is like… " sex to a nympho , but nothing sweet
i'm like beef , bustin' heat through your windows
i'm like a street sweeper , green leaf breather
like greeks in egypt
learning something deep from they teachers
i'm like crime , like your 9 , your man you would die for
always got you , i’m like pac dude you would cry for
i'm like a whole lot of loot , i'm like crisp money
corporate accounts from a rich company
i'm like ecstasy for ladies , i'm like all races
combined in one man ; like the '99 summer jam
bulletproof hummer man
i'm like being locked down around new faces
and none of 'em fam
i'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
i'm a poor man's dream , a thug poet
live it and i write down and i watch it blow up
y'all know what i'm like
y'all play it your system every night , now…
" nas is like " " life or death "
" i'm a rebel "
" my poetry's deep , i never fell "
" nas is like " " nas is like "
" half man half amazing "
" no doubt "
