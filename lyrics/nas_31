life , i wonder
will it take me under ?
i don't know
imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin'
imagine going to court with no trial
lifestyle cruising blue bahama waters
no welfare supporters
more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
days are shorter , nights are colder
feeling like life is over , these snakes strike like a cobra
the world's hot my son got knocked , evidently
it's elementary , they want us all gone eventually
trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
if coke was cooked without the garbage
we'd all have the top dollars
imagine everybody flashin' , fashion , designer clothes
lacing your clique up with diamond roles
your people holding dough , no parole , no rubbers
go in raw , imagine law with no undercovers
just some thoughts for the mind
i take a glimpse into time
watch the blimp read " the world is mine "
if i ruled the world ( imagine that ! )
i'd free all my sons , i love 'em love 'em , baby
black diamonds and pearls
( could it be , if you could be mine , we'd both shine ? )
if i ruled the world
( still living for today , in these last days and times )
the way to be , paradise like relaxin'
black , latino and anglo - saxon
armani exchange deranged
cash , lost tribe of shabazz , free at last
brand new whips to crash , then we laugh in the iller path
the villa house is for the crew , how we do
trees for breakfast , dime sexes and benz stretches
so many years of depression make me vision
the better livin' , type of place to raise kids in
open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
but i'm as wise as the old owl , plus the gold child
seeing things like i was controllin' , click rollin'
tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin'
trips to paris , i civilized every savage
give me one shot , i turn trife life to lavish
political prisoner set free , stress free
no work release , purple m3's and jet skis
feel the wind breeze in west indies
i make coretta scott - king mayor the cities
and reverse fiends to willies
it sounds foul , but every girl i meet'd go downtown
i'd open every cell in attica , send 'em to africa
if i ruled the world ( imagine that ! )
i'd free all my sons , i love 'em love 'em , baby
black diamonds and pearls
( could it be , if you could be mine , we'd both shine ? )
if i ruled the world
( still living for today , in these last days and times )
and then we'll walk right up to the sun
hand in hand
we'll walk right up to the sun
we won't land
you'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
duck down in car seats , heat's mandatory
running from jake , getting chased , hunger for papes
these are the breaks , many mistakes go down out of state
wait , i had to let it marinate , we carry weight
trying to get laced , flip the ace , stack the safe
millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
making moves in atlanta , back - and - forth scrambler
â€˜cause you could have all the chips , be poor or rich
still nobody want a nigga having shit
if i ruled the world and everything in it , sky's the limit
i push a q - 45 infinit ( i )
it wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or b felonies
strictly living longevity to the destiny
i thought i'd never see , but reality struck
better find out before your time's out , what the fuck ?
if i ruled the world ( imagine that ! )
i'd free all my sons , i love 'em love 'em , baby
black diamonds and pearls
( could it be , if you could be mine , we'd both shine ? )
if i ruled the world
( still living for today , in these last days and times )
