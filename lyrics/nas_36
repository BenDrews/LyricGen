escobar season has returned
it's been a long time , been a long time comin'
it's life or death for me now
but you know , there's no turning back now
this is what makes me ; this is what i am
you can hate me now , ( q.b. ) but i won't stop now ( real niggas )
cause i can't stop now , ( bravehearts ) you can hate me now ( c'mon )
but i won't stop now , cause i can't stop now
you can hate me now , you can hate me now
well you hate me , i'm gon' hate you too
it's as simple as that
die motherfucker , die motherfucker , die
you don't give a fuck , i don't give a fuck
go down any way you want it to go down
weak , jealous motherfuckers
fuck y'all !
don't hate me , hate the money i see , clothes that i buy
ice that i wear , flows that i try , close your eyes
picture me rollin' , sixes , money foldin'
bitches , honeys that swollen to riches , nas get in ya
most critically acclaimed pulitzer prize winner
best storyteller , thug narrator , my style's greater
model dater , big threat to a lot of you haters
commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
almost a decade , quite impressive
most of the best is in the essence
for this rap shit that i stand for
expandin' more to the big screen , bill gates dreams
but it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
want me off the scene fast , but good things last
like your favorite mc still makin' some mean cash
first rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
but you still wanna hate , be my guest , i suggest
money is power motherfucker
i got millions of thugs on salary
you wanna hate me then hate me ; what can i do
but keep gettin' money , funny i was just like you
i had to hustle hard , never give up , until i made it
now y'all sayin' " that's a clever nigga , nothin' to play with "
hate on me , i blew but i'm the same o.g
people warn me , when you're on top , there's envy
took my niggas out the hood , but you doubt on us
sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
my bad , should i step out my shoes , give 'em to you ?
here's my cars and my house , you can live in that too
criticize when i flow for the streets , hate my dress code
gucci this , fendi that , what you expect , ho ?
nickname esco , took this game to its threshold
best flow , i bet the whole u.s. know
try to make it like you the realest , but who the illest ?
think we all know the answer to that , cause niggas feel this right
you think i'mma come this far , and let you niggas stop me now ?
i hate you too !
it's a thin line between paper and hate
friends and snakes , nine millis and thirty - eights
hell or the pearly gates ; i was destined to come
predicted , blame god , he blew breath in my lungs
second to none , wicked turn wives to widows
shoot through satin pillows , the desolate one
took a little time to claim my spot
chairman of the board until this game stop , and i side with the lord
ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
plottin' i'm sure , to catch me with they glocks to my jaws
tried stickin' me up but i flipped on these ducks
instead of me , ambulances were picking them up
niggas fear what they don't understand , hate what they can't conquer
guess it's just the theory of man
became a monster , on top of the world , never fallin'
i'm as real as they come from day one , forever ballin'
c'mon
you ain't never seen a nigga like me , ever in your life
and that's what you can't understand !
