( y'all ready for nas ?
queensbridge , y'all ready to see nasty nas ?
uh huh , they ready )
yeah , word
got some remy martin
and some good - ass cigars , check it out
ayo , late night , candlelight , fiend with diesel in his needle
queensbridge leader , no equal
i come from the wheel of ezekiel
to pop thousand - dollar bottles of scotch
smoke pot and heal the people
any rebuttal to what i utter get box - cutter'd
count how many bad honeys i slut , it’s a high number
name a nigga under the same sky that i’m under
who gets money , remain fly , yeah , i wonder
eyes flutter , it's love when nas pops up
stars get starstruck , panties start drippin’
the ways of carlito , blaze , torpedo cigars
drop rolls , hoes drop clothes
louis the xiii , freaks , women nice size
i ride like porsches , thick , brown and gorgeous
it ain’t my fault , semi - automatic weapons i brought
the world crazy , i’m rich and i’m girl - crazy
dick ‘em , convince ‘em all to praise me
they ideology is confusion , i lose ‘em
fellates me , who hate me ? my gun off safety
since the tunnel and skate key , my jewelry in hd
silent rage , pristine in my vintage shades
i’m not in the winters of my life
or the beginning stage , i am the dragon
maserati , pumpin’ biggie , the great legend
blastin’ , i’m after the actress who played faith evans
my little jackie onassis , dig ?
i’m so high i never land , like mike jackson’s crib
vest on , .45 still crack your rib sacrilege
talk trash about the nasty kid
past nasty now , i’m gross and repulsive
talk money , is you jokin’ ?
cash everywhere , in my bank , in the sofa
in the walls , in the cars , in my wallet , in my pocket
on the floors , ceilings , the safe , bitch , i got it
you envy , but don’t offend me
i’m skinny , but still i’m too big for a bentley
you are your car , what could represent me ?
too godly to be a bugatti
you honestly must design me somethin' tommy mottonic from queens had before the ’90s
drug dealer car , rush to the bar
move , niggas ! we don’t give a fuck who you are
black card heavy like a magnet , in my stitched denims
pretty women see them saggin’
bet a hundred stacks niggas’ll run it back
just havin’ fun , i ain’t even begun to black
light another blunt in fact
( nasty ) yeah , nasty kid
for the hustlers , thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin’
saying , " it was nas i used to hustle with "
i display fashions while my lungs engage hashish
guns on my waist , past this
since i’m cakin’ up , put funds in my safe , laughin’
and joining the blunt passin’ you niggas was straight assin’
excuse the vulgarity , i’m still not fully adjusted
or used to the new fans hearin’ me spit rapidly
i never see the whips niggas be claimin’ they drivin’
i guess entertainment means blatantly lyin’
fake it ’til you make it , i’ve driven those toys
been in the wars , in the streets , cops kickin’ in doors
for my deen niggas , your flow cheap as limousine liquor
i’m no fake rap cd listener
sit back and roll a mean swisher
for my g's , tell these clowns make room for the king , nigga
