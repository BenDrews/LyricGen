it ain't hard to tell , i excel , then prevail
the mic is contacted , i attract clientele
my mic check is life or death
breathin' a sniper's breath , i exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
deep like the shining , sparkle like a diamond
sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
hit the earth like a comet—invasion !
nas is like the afrocentric asian : half - man , half - amazin'
‘cause in my physical i can express through song
delete stress like motrin , then extend strong
i drink moët with medusa , give her shotguns in hell
from the spliff that i lift and inhale ; it ain't hard to tell
the buddha monk's in your trunk , turn the bass up
not stories by aesop
place your loot up , parties i shoot up
nas , i analyze , drop a jew - el , inhale from the l
school a fool well , you feel it , like braille
it ain't hard to tell , i kick a skill , like shaquille holds a pill
vocabulary spills , i'm ill plus matic
i freak beats , slam it , like iron sheik
jam like a tec with correct techniques
so analyze me , surprise me , but can't magmatize me
scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
i leave 'em froze , like heroin in your nose
nas will rock well ; it ain't hard to tell
this rhythmatic explosion
is what your frame of mind has chosen
i'll leave your brain stimulated , niggas is frozen
speak with criminal slang , begin like a violin
end like leviathan , it's deep ; well , let me try again
wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit , troop
i dominate break loops , givin' mics men - e - strual cycles
street's disciple , i rock beats that's mega trifle
and groove even smoother than moves by villanova
you're still a soldier , i'm like sly stone in cobra
packin' like a rasta in the weed spot
vocals will squeeze glocks
mcs eavesdrop , though they need not to sneak
my poetry's deep , i never fell
nas' raps should be locked in a cell ; it ain't hard to tell
