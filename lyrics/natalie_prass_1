you plucked me from the vine
a clean detachment
and although it wasn't time
i let it happen
oh you , you don't leave me no choice
oh you , you don't leave me no choice
oh you , you don't leave me no choice
but to run away
you are a bird of prey
with a heart like the night
i had all the room to hide
in deep fields and tall grasses
your sight , it will not tire
until you have me
and i love you , oh but no
oh , you will not let me go
now the sun , it sets , i'm on the run
i can't get you away from me
oh you , you don't leave me no choice
oh you , you don't leave me no choice
oh you , you don't leave me no choice
but to run away
you are a bird of prey
with a heart like the night
ooh , and i never said i didn't want you knocking on my door
all this run and chase , it's almost like i planned it
never have i felt arms this tight on me before
well , i never said i didn't want you knocking on my door
all this run and chase , it's almost like i planned it
it's out of hand it's , ooh , out of my control
oh you , you don't leave me no choice
oh you , you don't leave me no choice
oh you , you don't leave me no choice
but to run away
you are a bird of prey
with a heart like the night
i never said
i never said i didn't want you
i never said i didn't want you knockin' on my door
i never said
i never said i didn't want you
i never said i didn't want you knockin' on my door
