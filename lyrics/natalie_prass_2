i don't feel much
afraid i don't feel anything at all
in the name of love
i keep close but i am gone
stuck with his stride
even when the road was long
climbing one step at the time
waiting for a reason to fall
our love is like a long goodbye
we keep waiting for the train to cry
because my baby don't understand me
he don't understand me anymore
oh no , my baby don't understand me anymore
oh , what do you do when that happens ?
where do you go when the only home that you know is with a stranger ?
when our love was young
we could make the whole world crumble
oh , but with one word
he could turn it all the way around
our love is like a long goodbye
we keep waiting for the train to cry
because my baby don't understand me
he don't understand me anymore
oh no , my baby don't understand me anymore
oh , what do you do when that happens ?
where do you go when the only home that you know is with a stranger ?
our love is a long goodbye , our love is a long goodbye
our love is a long goodbye , our love is a long goodbye
our love is a long goodbye , our love is a long goodbye
our love is a long goodbye
waiting on the train , waiting on the train
our love is a long goodbye , our love is a long goodbye
our love is a long goodbye , our love is a long goodbye
our love is a long goodbye , our love is a long goodbye
our love is a long goodbye
waiting on the train , waiting on the train
our love is a long goodbye , our love is a long goodbye
our love is a long goodbye , our love is a long goodbye
our love is a long goodbye , our love is a long goodbye
our love is a long goodbye
waiting on the train , waiting on the train
we keep waiting for the train to cry
oh , because my baby don't understand me
ooh , he don't understand me anymore
oh no , my baby don't understand me anymore
what do you do when that happens ?
where do you go when the only home that you know is with a stranger ?
