the turning of space
can't stop its rate
only in time
will it start to fade
and i feel the same
i can't stop my shame
i want to reach out
but i don't know which way
and i'll break my legs
cause they want to walk to you
just want to know you violently
oh , i've had enough of talking politely
and the red is there , it's all over me
it's overlaid eloquently
ooh , each day i hide
the extent of my mind
i put away things alright
until companionless nights
but i wish i could turn it off or shred it
wish forever rest
but as long as you're there
all my secrets compress
and i'll break my arms
cause they want to hold you
just want to know you violently
oh , i've had enough of talking politely
and the red is there , it's all over me
it's overlaid eloquently
and i'll break all my bones
cause they all , they all want you
just want to know you violently
oh , i've had enough of talking politely
and the red is there , it's all over me
it's overlaid eloquently
