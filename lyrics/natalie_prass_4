i remember you told me
you'd love me only
and now you've gone and treated me like a fool
you never say where you're going
stay out until the morning
and i know you've been treating me like a fool
all the loving that i made
all the promises that i gave
then you let me down
and every story and every lie
won't save you from me saying goodbye
so tonight when you're out
you'll come back to an empty house
with a note signed " sincerely , your fool "
built this new life before me
but you fill up my memory
and they haunt me like memories often do
and they tell me i'll always be your fool
oh , i guess i'll always be your fool
