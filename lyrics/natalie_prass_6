christy
a name that isn't too short or too sweet
christy
why compare my love to yours if we both know he adores you , christy ?
there's a shadow of a smile in your eye , christy
there's an echo of a kiss stolen from a man who swore i wouldn't have to miss
oh , christy
oh , why does it have to be
that she can take the hand of anyone she meets ?
still , the only one she sees belongs to me
oh , christy
does he ?
slide each of his fingers down your back when he
when he puts a new record on , oh , no , he comes on strong
oh , christy
i can tell you anything that he likes , christy
it's so wrong i'll still be here when all your love for him is gone
oh , christy
all his dreams aren't the only ones that you haunt
i never dreamt that this day would ever come
oh , christy
oh , christy
