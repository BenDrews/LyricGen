i remember you told me
that you'd love me only
and now you've gone and treated me like a fool
you never say where you're going
you stay out until the morning
and i know you've been treating me like a fool
all the loving i made
all the promises that i gave
then you let me down
and every story and every lie
won't save you from me saying goodbye ( bye )
so tonight when you're out
you'll come back to an empty house
with a note signed " sincerely , your fool "
i built this new life before me
but you fill up my memory
and they haunt me like memories often do
and they tell me that i'll always be your fool
i guess i'll always be your fool
