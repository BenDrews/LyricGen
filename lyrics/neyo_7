my sexy love
so sexy
she makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
just one touch
and i erupt like a volcano and cover her with my love
baby girl you make me say
and i just can't think ( of anything else i'd rather do )
than to hear you sing ( sing my name the way you do )
when we do our thing ( when we do the things we do )
baby girl you make me say
sexy love girl the things you do
( oh baby baby ) keep me sprung , keep running back to you
oh i love making love to you
baby girl you know you're my ( sexy love )
i'm so addicted to her she's the sweetest drug
just enough
still too much say that i'm simp and i'm sprung all of the above
i can't help she makes me say
and i just can't think ( of anything else i'd rather do )
than to hear you sing ( sing my name the way you do )
when we do our thing ( when we do the things we do )
oh , baby girl you make me say
sexy love girl the things you do
( oh baby baby ) keep me sprung , keep running back to you
oh i love making love to you
baby girl you know you're my ( sexy love )
oh baby what we do it makes the sun come up

and i don't know what i'd do if i would lose your touch
that's why i'm always keepin' you around... my sexy love
