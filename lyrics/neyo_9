she's staring at me , i'm sitting wondering what she's thinking
nobody's talking , 'cause talking just turns into screaming
and now as i'm yelling over her , she yelling over me
all that that means is neither of us are listening
and what's even worse , that we don't even remember why we're fighting
so both of us are mad for nothing ( fighting for )
nothing ( crying for )
nothing , ( oohh )
when we won't let it go for nothing ( come back for )
nothing
it should be nothing
to a love like what we got , oh baby
i know sometimes it's gonna rain
but baby can we make up now
'cause i can't sleep through the pain ( can't sleep through the pain )
girl i don't want to go to bed , mad at you
and i don't want you to go to bed , mad at me
no , i don't want to go to bed , mad at you
and i don't want you to go to bed , mad at me
oh no , no , no
and it gets me upset , girl , when you're constantly accusing
( asking questions like you already know )
we're fighting this war , but baby both of us are losing
( this ain't the way that love is supposed to go )
what happened to working it out ?
we fall into this place where you ain't backing down
and i ain't backing down
so what the hell do we do now ?
it's all for nothing ( fighting for )
nothing ( crying for )
nothing , ( oohh )
we won't let it go for nothing ( no , not for )
nothing
it should be nothing
to a love like what we got , oh baby
i know sometimes it's gonna rain ( it's gonna rain )
but baby can we make up now
'cause i can't sleep through the pain ( i can't sleep through the pain )
girl i don't want to go to bed , mad at you
and i don't want you to go to bed , mad at me
no , i don't want to go to bed , mad at you
and i don't want you to go to bed , mad at me
oh no , no , no
oh baby this love ain't gonna be perfect ( perfect , perfect ) oh no
and just how good it's gonna be
we can fuss and we can fight
as long as everything's alright between us
before we go to sleep
baby we're gonna be , happy , baby
i know sometimes it's gonna rain ( soon it's gonna rain )
but baby can we make up now ( can we make up now )
'cause i can't sleep through the pain ( i can't sleep through the pain )
girl i don't want to go to bed , mad at you
and i don't want you to go to bed , mad at me
no , i don't want to go to bed , mad at you
and i don't want you to go to bed , mad at me
oh no , no , no
