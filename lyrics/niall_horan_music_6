harry styles :
time for round two , grandpa , i hope you are a fast reactor
we write the 'best songs ever' , and we've got the x factor !
bugger off , ya bugs ! all five of us got the style
all four of you got warrants as domestic pedophiles ! 1d's the commotion 'cross the ocean
1 half of you are dead , we keep things in motion !
there are 4 problems here , and we are the solvers
we'll shoot you down like john , with a lyrical revolver
this is a battle of the brits , so retrieve your shields
and stop dreaming all day in your strawberry fields
you can't handle my swag , don't you ever forget
i'm the most fly swatter , just crushed these insects
paul mccartney :
i'm gonna kick you with my brown shoes , i've got nothing to prove
this boy band is so gonna lose , since their only fans are girls in their youth
you gotta choose , fool , give up or maybe try to improve
you think you're the big hit news when you literally copy our moves ?
on the fame mountain we're still climbing , while you're horrible at rhyming
harry , i will devour you like a lion , better call big papa simon !
your horrible songs keep me up at night , your lyrics suck , as usual
there's one thing i gotta say , these buttbuddies aren't beautiful
if john would write a song about you all , it would be called 5 virgins
we're the greatest , while you're the gay backstreet boys version
it's in our name , we'll beat you , since our skill is so lethal
you're walking towards the direction of being killed by the beatles
harry styles :
you old stoners are haggards and fags in the sack
niall horan :
we'll leave you four and your chink girlfriend snapped
louis tomlinson :
who the frig knows who ringo is ?
zayn malik :
george , i'll harass you
liam payne :
and lennon's been dead
louis tomlinson :
so that leaves us the last two
harry styles :
run away , our millions of fans will make sure you won't go far
liam payne :
1d is the best band in the world , we're the real starrs !
niall horan :
we'll be living while we're young , kicking your asses back to yesterday !
louis tomlinson :
you all need help !
zayn malik :
we'll beat all these beatles without delay
harry styles :
your music is cancerous , like your good friend george !
liam payne :
your fans are dead , nobody loves you anymore !
harry styles :
this is the end for you four , you shouldn't have made us do this
harry styles , liam payne , niall horan & zayn malik :
now you know not to mess with harry , liam , niall , zayn and
louis tomlinson :

paul mccartney :
well these kids are steppin' up to us , we made the rock era our bitch
john lennon :

ringo starr :

george harrison :
while we're the beatles , so great we have stuff nobody has
ringo starr :
we've got the most known covers , and we're the best in kicking ass
paul mccartney :
i'm paul mc cartney , we're known for the most hits
john lennon :
you're known for getting eight year olds and sucking british dick
george harrison :
your " little things " will never slip up any girl on their will
ringo starr :
baby , you can drive my car ! we'll drive you to a standstill
john lennon :
we're spitting hot on this vinyl ! you've reached out fame ? ours is tripled
george harrison :
no wonder taylor swift left harry to cry ! he has 4 goddamn nipples
paul mccartney :
your dads didn't use protection , now the beatles are infesting
rest in pieces cause
all :
the beatles blew your bodies in all directions
