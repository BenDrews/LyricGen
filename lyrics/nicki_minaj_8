he said he came from jamaica , he owned a couple acres
a couple fake visas cause he never got his papers
gave up on love , fucking with them heart breakers
but he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
he was mixed with a couple things , ball like a couple rings
bricks in the condo and grams to sing sing
left arm , baby mother tatted
5 - year bid up north when they ratted
anyway , i felt him , helped him , put him on lock , seat belt him
took him out to belgium , welcome
bitches this pretty , that's seldom
this box better than the box he was held in
i'm momma dee in that order , i call him daddy like daughters
he like it when i get drunk , but i like it when he be sober
that's top of the toppa , i never fuck with beginners
i let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
i'm in the zone
they holler at me but it's you
you , this ain't high school
me and my crew , we can slide through
give it to you whenever you want
put it wherever you want
baby , it's yours
anywhere , everywhere
baby , it's your world , ain't it ?
baby , it's your world , ain't it ?
she got a nigga at home , and one on the side
best friend is a dyke , they fucked around a few times
her and her momma alike , so all they do is fight
i tell her make me some money , she tell me " make me a wife "
i tell her , " bitch , you crazy , fuck wrong with you ? "
and excuse my french , but i'm a long kisser
and then she try to tell me i'm the only one that's hittin'
and i say , " what about them niggas ? " she say , " what about them niggas ? "
you right , what you doing tonight ?
put on something tight , don't judge me , i get life
she love me like a brother , but fuck me like a husband
pussy like a oven , too hot to put my tongue in
all i had to do is rub it , the genie out the bottle
pussy so wet , i'mma need goggles
she tell me that's it's mine , i tell her stop lying
mine and who else ? she say worry 'bout yourself
lil tune
they holler at me but it's you
you , this ain't high school
me and my crew , we can slide through
give it to you whenever you want
put it wherever you want
baby , it's yours
anywhere , everywhere
baby , it's your world , ain't it ?
baby , it's your world , ain't it ?
i know you want it , boy
i see you tryin'
just keep on pushin'
i'm a let you slide in
just close your eyes and
this horizon
it's ready , come get you some
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah
