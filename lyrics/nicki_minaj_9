i'm angry but i still love you
pills n potions

can't stand it but i still love you

i still love , i still love , i still love , i still love , i still lo - o - ove
i still love , i still love , i still love , i still love , i still love
ayo , they could never make me hate you
even though what you was doin’ wasn’t tasteful
even though you out here lookin’ so ungrateful
i'mma keep it movin’ be classy and graceful
i told 'em it’s no friends in the game , you ain’t learned that yet
all the bridges you came over , don’t burn that yet
niggas want respect , but niggas ain't earned that yet
self - righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the bible , that
they love you , when really they no different from all your rivals
but i still don’t wish death on ‘em , i just reflect on 'em

yo , people will love you and support you when it’s beneficial
i'mma forgive , i won't forget , but i'mma dead the issue
soon as you out a nigga’s life is when they start to miss you
they see you doin' good now , it’s kinda hard to diss you
niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you
but i sped off in a benzy , i see the envy , when i’m causing a frenzy
so i pop pills for 'em , cop cribs in the hills , on ‘em
