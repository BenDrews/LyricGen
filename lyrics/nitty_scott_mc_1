yo , i can see it in your eyes , think you just got two
fascinated with the new flu , two by two
all my zoo shit true and i'm too badu
i be all over their head like the shampoo do
snoozing on a revolution so i blew by you
literally leave your body in the blue bayou
we be looking at your troopers and your crew like ''who ? ''
educating , elevating on your boo iq
pledge allegiance to nothing , i got the wood and he crushing
my kamikazes are coming to light picasso percussion , you dummy
little bummy ain't a damn thing funny
you so poor , honey , all you have is money
so inhale the fragrance
i be the apex , ho , get on my wavelength
another like me ? highly unlikely
hiding in my psyche , i dare you to come and find me
i dare you to come and dare me to flip and commit a homi
i promise to god i'm probably the god of rhyming
dividing the profits with prophets , prophecy wasn't lying
i grew my hair out just so i could look like a lion
so when i say i wore it , that metaphor is more exciting
i understand that , for sure like beach homes and sand crabs
bonjour , bitch pardon my french
i never been to france , but i like to kiss like them
consider this the kiss of death like jada came through
nitty , you know it's love when they showing hate , boo
food for thought , hope you get a plateful
lately i done turned the booth to a dinner table
young mindfuck , what the fuck you thought ?
fire in my eyes , in my shades it's dark
and i'm still getting used to this famous part
they say i sold my soul , but what about what i bought ?
soul
it's rap game , little bhudda baby
i take it you can hang in spaces with mother nature the bhudda lady
you feel my nexus , i'm flexin' my solar plexus
we can have a flower orgy and keep it all in an essence
more dread from warheads
they want the poor dead , but i fed the universe on my forehead
and did this happen beforehand ?
now face it , they just basically erasing them glitches up in the matrix
always thought the term black magic was kinda racist
and i have yet to find intelligent basis for all the hatred
attracting and deflecting a core of my star portals
ain't it gorgeous to be mortal ? i couldn't be more cordial
now who dare stare into the hazy sun ?
i tell 'em it was i , nitty scott the wavy one
i move things that move things with mood swings
got these niggas kissing my mood ring , i'm out
