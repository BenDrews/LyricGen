it's a sound session ; party in my head
could've been a listener , rather rap instead
could've sold divisions of a contradiction
but nitty scott realer than non - fiction
see i bend the track over , beat it like a drum
finger fuck the english language 'til she cum
put the rhythm to her nipple , tickle her syllables
juicin' up her literal 'til all the similes trickle
and dribble where the partner let her rhetoric spell
uh , she sweatin' metaphors , guess that's what i met her for
my shit deep , mainstream won't peep
so i just sweep the street and tell the sheep to go to sleep
i just freak the beat and move your sneakers when i speak
i just bring the heat , it melts your speakers when it leak
rich in the mind , ignorance so costly
so i'm dealin' 'em , killin' em , not softly
cause i'm only two decades with a knack
for these tracks , not a gatt , so yeah , fuck that
non - profit in your socket , pro bono prophet
rockets in my pocket and i know you tryna' knock it
but this music got 'em hopin' and copin' and floatin'
strokin' and gropin' and provokin' emotions
my shit is dope and , no jokin' , you open
so power to the broken when the realness is spoken
chorus :
yeah , yeah , yeah
oh , oh
you should tell somebody your story , before you give up all the glory
yeah , yeah , yeah
oh , oh
that's why i go and tell you now
before you ever question how ( question )
yo
i'm mc'd up , and d'd up , knee'd up
and it's about time that the game done re'ed up
my intellectual property , hip - hoperty , while niggas run monopoly stoppily
take my strret cred' and set it and bet it
you could never do me , even if simon said it
you could never keep your mind in while you're vibin' to my lines and
mind your rhymes man , these are hard times when
i rap like i got somethin' to prove , cause i do
this is me , and my crew :
nitty scott ; who are you ?
this is duke , this is true ; this is what i fuckin' do
sick shots on the loop , this is fresh from the stu' ( fresh )
day in my kicks , shit you wouldn't be with
and you only call life a bitch cause she wouldn't let you hit it
got me on a stand tryna get me to admit it
but killin' all these rappers the only crime that i committed
boombox family
it's just the way i was raised
