he came up to me with some bullsh*t rap
he came up to me with some bullsh*t rap
he came up to me with some bullsh*t rap
yo when he came up to me i told him to step back
yo i was the best kept secret till i leaked it
flow seasick , then i peaced it like a beatnik
last of the the mohicans get to geeking when i free kick
b - r - double o - k - lyn street shit
bozo with my nine oh - oh
rapped around my pretty little finger like a yo - yo
know we got that good dro , sticky like a moco
flicking on them bics now my eyes all rojo
i give a damn about a hater
they want me like candy , baby now and later
so please don't approach me with a bullshit rhyme
i don't do battles , there's too many free lines
yo these retail - ass rappers such a gimmick
sucker emcees trying to tell me how to spit it
i ain't with it , catch me in the cypher with the nice type
i get some hype , you can't even hold the mic right
verbals , murder for the herbals
vocabulary hurdles hold weight like a verdal
industry rule number four thousand and eighty
record company people are shady
i never let this game turn me to a clown
they so afraid of heights trying to be down
so step back ya'll , it's like that ya'll
we represent for hip - hop , and not for rap ya'll
it's true , i get the audience thicker than a snicker
sweet faced spitter , you can miss me with the glitter
kicked a little rap now they on me like a tack
and i gotta make moves like a military brat
matter fact , listen i'm a born star
wouldn't give a flying fuck , on the airplane with a porn star
roar fee - fi - fo - fum
i'm a five - two giant and these rappers so yum
my god , yes i live in my pod
armed with the facts i rap your whole ipod
then nitty be like hello city
to your city , then your city be like hello nitty
