it ain't hard to tell , you trying to keep the mozzarell'
while the whole damn game done gone to hell
i dominate you like a dominatrix
hate my greatness cause you clearly ain't this
send you on a permanent rap hiatus
too much noise , gotta change your muffler
super nitty , i'm a full - time juggler
juggernaut aiming for the jugular , yeah
now don't be trying to say you got your hands on the wheel
just because you got your little hands on a deal
what'd you have to do to get your brand on the seal ?
might look good , but you just not real
my flow raise eyebrows and the crime rate
full time is my motherfucking mind state
slim thang , but i got a big brain
big enough to know that these rappers never eating off of my plate
i ain't show to your little cipher
damn right , bitch , cause i'm way more nicer
than all these little chicks on the hip - hop scene
got 'em gassed up like they popped them beans
probably think we got a whole lot in common
rhyming for gucci , rhyming for rhyming
why ? cause we both got tits and a mic
and making words rhyme is a thing that you like ?
heard about your diss track , sorry that i missed that
i would never identify you with a diss back
hop in the booth and the past goes missing
i passed class without the ass kissing
play' em , spray 'em , slay 'em , man this shit is getting gory
i will tell my fucking story before i let you tell it for me
bitch !
hey , the name is nitty scott comma mc dot
don't forget the mother fucking mc
hey yo , i see you niggas out there fucking hating
sending tweets and shit
say that shit in my face
i'm tired of this bullshit
i've had some shit to say for a long time
i'm tired of being politically correct , you feel me ?
stop trying to fucking classify me
i'm a fucking human being , feel me ?
i'm not a fucking femcee , i'm an artist
