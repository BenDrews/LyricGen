this generation
rules the nation
no victims , no villains , no form
no thinking , no limits , just visions
surrender ego then mingle with the divine
and please wipe your feet before you enter my mind
i'm bear foot sitting in the lotus , focus on my kundalini have you taken notice
thinking i need stress , i think that it's need less
speaking of weed less , i'm learning to need less
and over drama the dalai lama in nirvana
threaten with the flow and i'm floating with the fauna
sailing ? we be in the nile
they say they want to find the art of chill
i'm teaching them how it's on
uh , uh , uh , uh , uh
cause i been on my let it glow
metaphysics flow entering the indigo
and now it seem that life is but a dream
and the cloth of our reality is leaking at the seams
but it's lucid ?
now we cruising and on the truth that i be inducing
naked activating from the root up to the crown
it's amazing in the void until you comeback down
but if i can't keep calm , i just keep on
sold songs to get my reborn and just breath on
and be the queen of the renaissance , mother of the new era
? tiara get free and recognize that
today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration
that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively
there is no such thing as death , life is only a dream
and we are the imagination of ourselves. here's tom with the weather
if every eight year old was taught meditation
i think we have peace for an entire generation
set the times ablaze , we do it in waves
and be brave like ancestors on slave ships for days
stomach churning because the world is burning
and we inhaling the second hand , but i got a second plan
carry the comradery to continents
we don't need religion cause we got our consciousness - ness
and i ain't just an optimist
new earth is coming ain't no stopping this
say goodbye to buy consume die
all my realized beings will spread wings and fly
that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself
