yo tryna stay vegged in my head at this empty fort
push the curtains back with eyes open like
good morning new york !
because it's not where i am it's where i'm going my friend
when i'm praying in the am all the angels descend
so the light force around me , every block every county
feeling rich type brownie like my destination found me
hatin cause their characters is soft like downy
why you can't see a sister making moves and just pound me
guess i gotta do like weezy , get from round me
jesus said that you can clown me
in the end you're gonna crown me
now i'm the realist gangsta i know
not because i move , but the things that i know
so you can ditty bop with your mind in captivity
i know that negativity the new festivity , one
my journey to the sun has begun
and your biggest mistake is never learning from one
i said i'm married to the game
so i am struggle's wife
dedicated to the public
man i love my life ( 5x )
hey ! i'm just a poet on a train
a dollar for your cup
and a smile for your game
music is a drug so i take it in the vein
feel no pain and distribute bits and pieces of my brain
my momma said it's just the god in me present from the fetus
she told me to be kind i could be sitting next to jesus
my daddy worked hard everyday just to feed us
raised me on sam cook and made me a good look
i used to earn an f and black on that whack test
cause i wrote bars on the back of that math test
focus is vital for my private recital
fuck the final i just had to get my hand on that vinyl
hopscotch , barrettes and boombox cassettes
hustlers on corners and churches with steeples
i promise i'll never disconnect from the people
i said im married to the game
so i am struggle's wife
dedicated to the public
man i love my life ( 5x )
