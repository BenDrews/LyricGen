but i know i'm going to change that tune
when i'm back on top
back on top in june
that's life
that's life
that's what all the people say
you're riding high in april
and shot down in may
that's life
and as ugly as it may seem
some people get their kicks
stomping on your dreams
just the other day i'm riding on my high horse
custom leather seats in the porsche to die for
the jewels alone made him sick , i am an eyesore
they couldn't see me like stevie , mon cherie amor
with three or four baddest of my women friends
one in the front , two in the back of the latest benz
rims spinning , tires pirelli
happy days , i'm fonzerelli
what you gonna tell me , am i not the realest ?
$1000 bottles , just so i can spill it
in the vip , standing on the couches
talkin' cash shhh cause my money's where my mouth is
ain't nothing like having that rug pulled from under you
kick you when you're down , no one gives a number two
down but not out , so you should never snooze
cause the dude who's at rock bottom ain't got nothing to lose
if you know who you are , you ain't got nothing to prove
cause to me , red bottoms ain't nothing but shoes
win , lose or draw , i'm working on these flaws
i just wish chicks would stop throwing me their draws
judas kisses , lying to the missus
racing to hit the street , looking for my mistress
now look at me , looking for forgiveness
and trying to put my thing where i ain't got no business
what goes around comes around
what goes up must go down
i said , what goes around comes around
what goes up must go down
i said , what goes around comes around
what goes up must go down
i said , what goes around comes around
what goes up must go down
