in that all too precious blood , i am covered
this is for you , dearly beloved
for every d - boy on the corner
mason jar in the cupboard
this is for you , dearly beloved
if i could
i would take back every foolish word that i uttered
i owe that to my momma
knowing how much she suffered
her first born taken by that 80s holocaust
then i turned around , served it a la carte
i'm all apart inside
can't breathe , chokin' on my windpipe
every time my nephew say he wanna rhyme
and i know he got to question
why i don't give him my blessing
that's only because i love you like you mine
and i refuse
we lose another
your father is my brother
them pipe dreams , let 'em burn
i can't usher
you in this game , knowin' it's a lion's den
i tell you like i tell my own son
reach higher than
chasin' that american dream
but life ain't always what it seems
so i had to bury that
should have known it was a scheme
any time e ( maserati e ) took one for the team
man , i had to bury that
half of my homies is in the bing
but y'all don't see behind the scenes
lord knows , i had to bury that
out there hustlin' that medellin
david banner , all i saw was green
they would have you think i am at odds with my sibling
how they look alike , yet bear no resemblance
all hail the clipse and all of their magnificence
but i cannot deny my deliverance
it is no coincidence
that god choose to use my brethren
to show the magnitude of these ties i'm severing
the fight's fixed , especially ya top 10
can you trust a list in which pusha isn't mentioned in ?
really ?
who copped a milli of them kilograms
broke 'em down , chopped 'em up
like a ceiling fan
we gave you truth , y'all ain't want it
y'all wanted spoof
now i'm holy ghost filled like i'm haunted
a warning , it's time to fall before him on your knees
it seem like everything that's real is what you won't believe
please , it's time to let go of the past
of the best duo ever
i guess i am an outcast
