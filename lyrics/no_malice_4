what i've done is unforgettable
my track record's incredible
the way i moved in the trap was so impeccable
it's identity fraud
the way i hear my signature all in your bars
it's so legible
unforgettable , unforgettable , unforgettable , unforgettable
let the games begin
as they reminisce over you , my god
as i reminisce on what could have been
the choices made , the situations that they put us in
young world , take heed to these sentiments
baby girl , don't you give up on your innocence
for that louis bag or that michael kors
i myself included , who don't love a filthy whore ?
but why sell yourself short
to hell with this paper and them lines you fell for
cause we praying on self esteem
and i know your mama taught you better , bitch you a queen
and yes , i did my thing
but them keys can't play forever , nigga you a king
just try to dig where i'm coming from
a checkered past , but look what has become of him
king me , as i bow down to the king's feet
lord willing , we gonna come to the light
now that's a prophesy
we all fall short of the glory that is god's
but something about these rappers reek of a facade
we were on the brick road , all the way to oz
to pull the curtain back just to find it's a mirage
late model cars , model broads everywhere
careful where you tread , with every step the devil's near
caution beware , for blinded is him
who calls it a trap yet still enters in
dancing for ones ain't what i find demeaning
it's having to pick them up , that's dollar's a mean demon
believe me , i too whored for that money
the best booga sugar , my pimp was a snow bunny
got every red cent , papa was no dummy
every chick bad , long hair with no tummy
you should learn from me , i suffered for my wrongs
they nose still running like a marathon
