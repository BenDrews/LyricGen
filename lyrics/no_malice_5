hear ye him or hear him not
you either fear me or fear me not
i know you see clearly , i'm coming for that spot
so , you need to fear me like i fear god
hear ye him or hear him not
you either fear me or fear me not
i know you see clearly , i'm coming for that spot
so , you need to fear me like i fear god
hear ye him
i should've been dead a long time ago
i offered it death , and almost said line i wrote
camouflaged it and act like i had offered hope
the gold chain was steady hanging , ni**as choked
my older brother was my hero till he started dope
wish i could've stopped his very first line of coke
but , i don't judge
we all got a guilty pleasure
and bless my mama heart , she still believe he getting better
that's faith and every man was dealt a measure
that's why i believe every word in red letter
i ain't no better cuz' even i supplied em'
for 15 or 20 i provide em'
but , never deny the man that's steady gettin' mad
at every time he begged for cash , i oblige em'
my conscious is speaking kinda loud lately
lord forgive me , i done killed my mama's baby
the gospel is foolish to those who are perishing
they nod and dose , minus the heroin
the truth's obvious , maybe too evident
but , clearly malicious is something i should've never been
here's to the death of him , we gon' say a prayer
i gave ya'll way enough time to prepare
for my second coming
that was the rehearsal
when the real second coming come , there is no reversal
pusha , i'm the first to admit i want to see ya' win
but , when we die , i wanna know i'm a see you again
and to my baby , i know i hurt you badly
for way lesser , i seen my mama leave my daddy
so , i gladly accept the fact you know i try
i guess that make you the wife , minus the y
i sigh , only cuz' i know the truth
yolo ? ? you only live once if you choose to
