there is no time
to say what i feel
it’s kinda hard to articulate
i guess i’m in a different place
different space , different time
i reason with a different mind
what i’m sayin is the things that i once loved
i now find myself ashamed of
in the game we done came up
but we ain’t all had the same luck
some of us heard the gavel slam
with all that snow came an avalanche
did we ever really stand a chance ?
well now it’s out of our hands , mercy
your little man¨ , 3rd grade
in little league , 1st place
proms , birthdays
we miss you in the worst way
there is no time
( there’s no time )
to say what i feel
( but i have to say what’s inside of my heart )
the most valuable asset we have is time
how do we use our time ?
all we have is right now
all we have is this moments
i don’t want to have regrets
i don’t wanna die thinking about what i should’ve done
but it’s never too late
for our god is a god of second chances
there is no time
to say what i feel
the things i call regrets
are the things that made me my best
he made a message out of my mess
so now my heart is a under arrest
i confess i was misguided , misled
no laws , i’m runnin a rep
roulette , gun in my hand
you don’t have to die to already be dead
think twice , life or death , choose life
some things are elementary
sometimes we create our own misery
but no penalty , you can let it go
he gave me a voice when i should’ve been an echo , echo…
there is no time ( i hear you )
to say what i feel
( there’s a voice crying out in the wilderness )
i don’t care what you’ve done
abortion ? adultery ? murder ?
there is no condemnation
you need to know this
there is a redeemer
have you tried everything ?
are you the same place you were in last year ?
at this time , then read the signs
don’t just watch the throne , pay homage to it
there is no time
to say what i feel
don’t be mistaken
one who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin
but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother
we all , at some point in time ended up ? ? world
we’ve all had the conversation with the old man
we all shook hands with the devil
and had fun doing it
but when is enough enough ?
are you getting nowhere fast ?
take a look in yourself , is this the real you ?
is this who you wanna be ?
for , i know the plans i have for you
declares the lord
plans to prosper you and not to harm you
plans to give you hope and a future
i think the misconception is...
that there is good people and bad people
you see the bible clearly tells us in romans
as it is written , " there is none righteous
no , not one. "
and in 1 john
it says " if he have no sin
we decieve ourselves and
the truth is not in us. "
and even in jeremiah
it says that " the heart is deceitful
above all things and desperately wicked
who can know it ? "
so , the bible is very clear on the sinful nature
of man
the difference is
whether you are repentant
or not
are you remorseful and seek forgiveness ?
or , are you laughing , dancing , smoking , and joking in your sins ?
that is the difference
then , some may say
well , you can just go on sinning , knowing
that you will be forgiven
and to that i would say
this is where belief comes in
cuz' if you truly believe
that christ literally
died for your sins
was flogged
beaten
spat on
pierced
a crown of thorns placed upon his head
and nailed to a cross
if you truly believe this
then , there is no way you can continue
to glory in your wickedness
god is not a man that he should lie
nor is he the son of man
that he should change his mind
he is the same
yesterday
today
and forever
so , if you want to recieve jesus
as your lord and savior
all you have to do is
repeat these words
god , i recognize that i am a sinner
i recognize that i am unable to save myself
i ask you for your forgiveness
and i accept your son , jesus , who died on the cross
for my sins
and rose again
please fill me with your holy spirit
and lead me all the days of my life
in jesus name , amen
