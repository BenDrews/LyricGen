bowing down to riches , bow down no mo'
tricking on these misses , bow down no mo'
all these dudes is snitches , bow down no mo'
i'm on top my business , bow down no mo'
bow down no mo' , bow down no mo'
bow down no mo' , bow down no mo'
bow down no mo' , bow down no mo'
bow down no mo' , bow down no mo'
god bless the child , that god is on
i don’t look to mama , her baby grown
we would ship em' in then we get em' gone
you could smell it on me , like a cheap cologne
he pardoned my wrongs , that’s what the father said
it’s like i had no soul , i was the walking dead
had to get ahead , ain’t got time to sympathize
i was selling that rock , and if he dies , he dies
so cold blooded but flooded was the bezzle
i was praising god but living like a failure
how could i meddle , all them years i peddled crack
i did it the best , how can i call the kettle black
big and bad , out here acting like nuttin' phase me
if tony is arraigned i would cry like a baby
look at his baby , snot with the ugly face
listening to some jurors , singing bailiff come take him away
those were the days , i remember them well
at the mariott , laying up with jezebel
don’t kiss and tell , this could be our little secret
telling me she loved me and i believed it
looking back , oh what a fool i was
different chick every night , like it was humorous
it fueled my lust but now i hang my head in shame
they got the nerve to ask , did they really hustle caine
yes indeed , them chickens really flew the coop
crack the gong with them birds , cock a doodle doo
them other dudes on the mic , ain't telling you the truth
that’s why i been sick of rap , chicken noodle soup
new recruits better salute , papa don’t play
they got me taking off my belt and hear sa da tay
what'd i say ? fix ya' face and pull up ya' bridges
save the riddens , one half of the clipse , no more collisions
