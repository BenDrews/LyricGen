shady aftermath and soul assassins
here we go !
niggas know what i'm about out here
i don't toot my own horn cause i don't have to
you could run your mouth i don't care
but if you get too close i'm gon' clap you
it's too real out here to be scared
a real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
a man is a last thing you should fear
it ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
we all die one day
niggas when i step up in a bar ( uh huh ) , faggots wanna look ( what ? )
like you motherfuckers got obie trice shook
like i'mma stand here as a man and
let some queer - ass , funny - looking nigga get the upper hand ( ha ha ha ! )
i got issues , got no time , got guns that mourn niggas' moms ( yeah ! )
shoot up clubs and destroy niggas' vibes ( come on ! )
everybody running for their motherfucking lives ( ahhhhhh ! ! ! )
tough club niggas , we leave early , cock back surely
open up your fade your gray brain meets motor city pave'
your nervous system still twitch off jay - z
o's an animals skirts get murked
don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
don't ever let a nigga tell you to play the bar hard
trust in god cause you's about to get catch a bullet scar
i give a fuck where you from , who you be with
keep this a secret {​​​​​​*whispers*}​​​​​​ right by the nuts
a 4 - 5 that'll light niggas up and this 4 - 5 high make not give a fuck
niggas know what i'm about out here
i don't toot my own horn cause i don't have to
you could run your mouth i don't care
but if you get too close i'm gon' clap you
it's too real out here to be scared
a real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
a man is a last thing you should fear
it ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
we all die one day
but as long as i'm here i'm gonna grab checks
and make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
poverty'll make your ass bet
my words touch niggas in jail make them wanna finish they last set
they say you live by the gun , you die by the next nigga gun
if that's the case then get a bigger one
you don't think i pack the pump cause i'm out the hood
that's a stereotype like everybody that's black can jump
i'm in the white mink , the fabric is done
got rings like mike , bird , magic , and them
out of dallas to the palace where the mavericks is from
living lavish i'm established , so the cabbage'll come
i'm in the clouds , you don't see me on the train
i travel first class , you ain't even got a tv on your plane
you should be easy on my name cause i ain't going back and forth
your boss and your captain soft ( bitch ! )
niggas know what i'm about out here
i don't toot my own horn cause i don't have to
you could run your mouth i don't care
but if you get too close i'm gon' clap you
it's too real out here to be scared
a real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
a man is a last thing you should fear
it ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
we all die one day

name 'em we gon' hit 'em chew 'em up and spit 'em out
{​​​​​​*hoch spit*}​​​​​​ too much venom and if you roll with 'em
we gon' fuck you up with 'em
i got too much momentum moving in my direction to lose
my shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in them , ( boom )
you know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through
g - unit , d - 1 - 2 and obie we all move like assassins
ski mask and gloves consider this as a warning
disaster comes faster than you can react to it , just ask muggs
but we are fizast , fuck your little bitch ass up
we are not killers , my vato will have you shot , though
dragged through the barrio and fucked like kim osorio's
little sorry ho ass , go ask b - real
we burn source covers like fucking cypress hill
did in the 90s , when you was in diapers still
shady records you better believe the hype is real
this is no joke , i don't smoke
but i toke enough secondhand to make my fucking p.o. choke
i'm an og , you're fucking with a g.i. joe
bia bia , mia mio a vida loc'
i'm a psycho , mariah ain't got shit on me
when i retire i'll be spitting baby food on people
at san ysidro ranch huddled up next to her
with hello kitty slippers on , humping her legs
you ever had your cap peeled back or your shit pushed in ?
i put my blade in you like a fucking pin cushion
slice your ear clear off , smirnoff and hen , dog
i'll show you to kill a fucking man like sen dog ( bring it , bring it , bring it back ! )
nobody told you that i'm loco , ése ?
i lack every sane chemical in my membrane
i'm slim shay...d and the 'd' is for deez nuts
and you can get each one for free so feast up
i'll pee in a cup for three months
i'm having an e party for easter please come
cause we gon'
we gon' bring it to anybody who want it , you want it , you gon' get it
you name 'em and we'll hit 'em , chew 'em up and spit 'em out {​​​​​​*spits*}​​​​​​
too much venom and if you roll with 'em
we gon' fuck you up with 'em
you can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
i got a twelve gauge mausberg to pump up your chest
have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest
fear me like you fear god cause i bring death
silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
i'm the strongest around , you know how i get down
i watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
and turn it off before it end cause the bad guy die
if you trying to buy guns , i'm the nigga to look to
so what they got bodies on them ? they still look new
you can raise your voice like you fitting to touch something
when i raise my knife , shit , i'm fitting to cut something
they say i walk like ron o'neal , and talk like goldie
if the bitch think i love her , the bitch don't know me
{​​​​​​*laughing*}​​​​​​
niggas know what i'm about out here

a real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
a man is a last thing you should fear
