nah , we ain't done !
i love being hated , it's great , it lets me know that i made it
i wouldn't have it no other way , i wouldn't trade it for the world
only let's me know that i'm loved
by so many other motherfuckers that ain't you
and as long , as you keep fucking with us , we keep fucking you up
and keep pulling the rug from up under you
and what's ever more fucked up , is we enjoy what we're doing
so much there ain't nothing that we love more than " pulling your skirts up "
and exposing you hoes so much , people are starting to wonder
what's up with them fucking wonder woman underoos
do unto others of you will have done unto you
so who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to
when someone runs up with a mask and puts a gun to you ?
you gon' ask yourself , how come your mans
didn't empty that last round that he had in curtis jackson's ass while he had the chance ?
you keep asking us to keep it on wax but we can't
this is past any irrationalization
we have captured national media attention
conversation is senseless , you can sense the tension start building
soon as we enter the 106 & park building
someone's gonna get killed and i swear to god
if someone so much as even touches one of my people
i'll put a million on his head
and you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
but i'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
and it ain't because i'm a bitch
it's because i ain't a bitch , i don't endanger people that i'm with
i'm a general , i ain't bush , i don't send my soldiers to war
i'm right there in the middle of the shit with 'em , so when i do get 'em
orders to storm your headquarters , you'll be fucking with a
fucking with a beef keeper , see you ain't eager to greet this lyrical meat cleaver
that'll eat ya , niggas wanna keep speaking
like it ain't even that deep
i got heat that'll sweep a nigga's street
see i wouldn't fuck with me neither , only heaven can help ya
i'll be searching for you longer than the legend of zelda
without a failure , there's gonna be hell to tell the
captain that a basset hound couldn't even smell ya
body , when i hide ya , i be on that mob shit
you another hoffa , under the renaissance , bitch !
you get bombed like lebanon with my own tactic
i snatch your head like one of saddam's kids
motherfucker , i'll handle you , we can have it out on any avenue
an " average man " flipped into an animal
shoot out your mandibles , cannons and ammunition
reload with precision , nigga , know the mechanicals
break the pistol down , you should see them handles
the street taught the child , no read up manuals
pushing crack vows , young nino brown
chasing green is the dream , when you're young and brown
bound to be a problem child , look what i'm involved in now
a 'dozen dirty' niggas and they all get down
resolve any problem that enlarge with ours
when revolvers we said " all men get down "
( kuniva ! )
while you're punching and tackling punks
i'm handling chumps , packing a pump
that's longer than the elephant trunk
on the streets i'm a beast , i feast upon the weak
so speak beef , i'll shoot you and scream " increase the peace "
a monster , pistol packing , pushing niggas off they hondas
stomp you , get it cracking , yanking bitches for they ganja
sneaky as fuck , i don't think mama beat me enough
when she was sleeping stuff , i was stealing the keys to the truck
shut the fuck up ! before you end up dead in the dump truck
or in the streets taking a nap , bleeding and lugged up
" who want what ? " like m. bleek , with this heat if you ten deep
then fuck it , it will be ten sleeping
know much'bout meyer lansky , don't tussle with my hand speed
clutch your burner , bust it and watch your man bleed
we ferocious , toast no holsters
approach us , throw heat straight from the soldiers
we the soldiers , yall the youngsters ( ha )
youngsters lungs puncture , dead in a dumpster
upstairs the monsters , hand full of drama
you scared of the drama , bomber the monster ( boof ! )
i'm back nigga ( proof ! ) , i reappear
shoot like , homie ain't seeing clear
blackness , carcass covered with cat fish
we murkers with no purpose other than practice
( bizzy ! )
there's three things i hate : liars , fakes and cheaters
alcoholics , sluts and fucking wife beaters
i guess that describes my life
i don't even know who song this is ( obie trice )
bitch , bizarre don't give a fuck about no hip hop
at my release party in a pink tank top and reeboks
this ja rule beef i ain't getting in
i'll need an r&b singer to sing at my wedding
i'll turn your face into a fucking meat patty
i'll fuck your mommy and go fishing with your granny
i'll shit on you , i'll pee on r. kelly , too
this is bizarre , see you " devil's night 2 "
