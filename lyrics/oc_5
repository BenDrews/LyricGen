1998 my family had that acura

back when boswell and percy had it active
couple bishops in the city building mansions

preaching self made millionaire status
when we could only eat at shoney's on occasion
after 'trina hit i had to transfer campus
your apartment out in houston's where i waited
stayin' with you when i didn't have a address
fuckin' on you when i didn't own a mattress
working on a way to make it outta texas
every night
droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
you know i can't hear none of that spend the night shit
that kumbaya shit
want to see nirvana , but don't want to die yet
wanna feel that na na though , could you come by
fuck with me after my shift
know them boys wanna see me broke down
see me bummed out , stressed out

rolling marijuana , that's a cheap vacation
my every day shit , my every day shit
