i thought that i was dreaming
when you said you loved me
it started from nothing
i had no chance to prepare
i couldn't see you coming
it started from nothing
i could hate you now
it's quite alright to hate me now
when we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good
if i could see through walls
i could see you're faking
if you could see my thoughts
you would see our faces
safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
we didn't give a fuck back then
i ain't a kid no more
we'll never be those kids again
we'd drive to syd's , had the x6 back then
back then
no matter what i did
my waves wouldn't dip back then
everything sucked back then
we were friends
i thought that i was dreaming
when you said you loved me
it started from nothing
i had no chance to prepare
i couldn't see you coming
it started from nothing
i could hate you now
it's quite alright to hate me now
but we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good
in the halls of your hotel
arm around my shoulder so i could tell
how much i meant to you... meant it sincere back then
we had time to kill back then
you ain't a kid no more
we'll never be those kids again
it's not the same , ivory's illegal
don't you remember ?
i broke your heart last week
you'll probably feel better by the weekend
still remember , had you going crazy
screaming my name
the feeling deep down is good
i thought that i was dreaming
when you said you loved me
it started from nothing
i had no chance to prepare
couldn't see you coming
and we started from nothing
i could hate you now
it's alright to hate me now
we both know that deep down
the feeling still deep down is good
all the things i didn't mean to say
i didn't mean to do
there were things you didn't need to say
did you mean to ? me too
i've been dreaming of you
dreaming of you
i've been dreaming of you
dreaming of you
i've been dreaming
dreaming
