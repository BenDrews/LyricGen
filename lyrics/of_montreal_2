it's different for girls
they've got sensitive language
they've built miles of defenses
they're not numbed by oppression
it's different for girls
from when they are children , they're depersonalized
aggressively objectified
they want to make a scene
they want to be adored
and then they want to be left alone when they get bored with that
it's different for girls
they are mercurial creatures , not a masculine dissonance
or sexual currency
though some of them are demons , all of them are gods
though some demons are women
for every one psycho bitch , there's ten thousand aggro pricks
it's different for girls
it's different for girls
they don't spit on the streets
they don't piss on the seat
they don't have to size up every person they meet
or create an elite
or poison the game so no one else can compete
they like chaos and mystery
and they like to combine them
sometimes they act crazy
but that doesn't define them
it's different for girls
they're not expected to fight
they're expected to sit and take some lesser man's shit
though it don't feel right
no , it don't feel right
though some women are demons , all of them are god
though some demons are women
for every one psycho chick , there's ten thousand hateful pricks
it's different
it's different
it's different
yeah , it's different for girls
it's different for girls
