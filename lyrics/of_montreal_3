like some sepulchral tableau
i sit frozen holding your hand
though i’m trying to think only
positive thoughts i understand
that this tomorrow
may not be the tomorrow that
your eviscerating suffering will end
oh , will you ever be yourself again ?
girl with the flu , i hear the death rune
she ain’t doin' well
her eyes they seem cast and fatherless
her psyche's cracked or , anyhow
she ain't speakin' now
nightfall , like some leaden sea
dilates as i hold vigil by your bed
watching the pillowcase soaking with sweat around your head
i can't repel this sneaking veil of morbidity
that's disfiguring the seraph of your face
oh , the organism's been debased
you scream that the books
are falling off of the shelf onto you
but i can't see them
your hallucination ravings
i'm writing them all down so
you can see read them
when your mind no longer aches
and your febrility breaks
girl with the flu , i hear the death rune
she ain’t doin' well
her eyes they seem cast and fatherless
her psyche's shattered or , anyhow
she ain't speakin' now
