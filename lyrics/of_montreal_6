other people can be so disappointing
i need to spend more time alone
what gives us the right to be so depressing ?
224 west 16th street was our cathedral
these tears i cry for you must prove that i'm not the demon that i'm meant to be
you say you love me though , just like you , i'm too shady
knowing what you know , it must be hard to trust someone who's so similar to yourself
don't you know it's pointless to try and bully me into caring more
it's through no fault of your own , it's really just the boredom of being someone's captive
drinking at the jane hotel
'til it was overrun by terrible people
we heard him say his name from the train
as usual , eyes dead from anti - anxiety meds
and the old gang grasping for air that's not there
seeking out my own authentic season in hell
though it doesn't feel quite as pompous
at least not as i can
at least not as i can tell
the misery loop that you sent me on
it wrecked me for other summers
but now that i am free and almost alone
down in chelsea , i feel better
why would you ask ? why should you care how i'm doing ?
do i bother you with those kinds of vapid questions anymore ?
i wanna matter , i wanna be your friend , not a poison
this kind of love , our kind of love is so demoralizing
seeking out my own authentic season in hell
though it doesn't feel quite as caustic
'least not as i can
at least not as i can
at least not as i can tell
