the pigs are taking shots at the mourners on the hill
i'm truly not neutral but i lost all direction
day i woke ready to blow the bridge
for finding you hand over your mouth
so instead , i burned my own village down
i'm grieving for you , my love
and i don't understand what's going on
just as the twin volcanoes of cuauhnƒÅhuac , we were once stable
so sad i must bury every thought of you before it shows its teeth
now i amuse myself with the dubious form of virgilian lots
like your neo - feminist divinations
our memories , once almost sacred , are embarrassments to me now
of the three things i find most shocking , the first is how trivial you are
the second is my depth of feeling ; third , the purity of our collapse
