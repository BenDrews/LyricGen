i wanna belong to you
i wanna be yours
i don't wanna be mine anymore i wanna be yours
i wanna lose my ego
i wanna be possessed by you
i don't care about my freedom
i just want to be yours yours only yours
i was twitching while you painted your eyes
feeling all lit up inside like the torches on saint john's eve
and i wanted to be wealth to you cause you're above you're above you're above
you are above
my love , above
you're the only beauty that i ever dream of
i wanna belong to you
i wanna be yours
i don't wanna live in fantasies
i wanna be yours
i want to lose my identity
i want to become one with you
i don't care about myself anymore
i just want to be yours yours only yours
i was twitching while you painted your eyes
feeling all lit up inside like the torches on saint john's eve
and i wanted to be wealth to you cause you're above you're above you're above
you are above
my love , above
you're the only beauty that i ever dream of
i was twitching while you painted your eyes
feeling all lit up inside like the torches on saint john's eve
and i wanted to be wealth to you cause you're above you're above you're above
you are above
my love , above
you're the only beauty that i ever dream of
