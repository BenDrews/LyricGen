sister bessie don't you say no prayers for me
a slow boat's gonna lead me where i'm bound
i'm far to travel far across the distant sea
my destiny will lead me where i'm bound
i came with nothing but thoughts from another planet
a heart that you'll never break , and a dream that you can't imagine
i'm far from average , i doubt that you understand it
i put my pain in the paint , and put it all on the canvas
painted a picture so vivid that i envisioned my life without any limit and try my hardest to live it
i am a dreamer , you see it in my demeanor
i'll be this way to death and take it up with the reaper
and through the speaker you'll hear it without a doubt
like i don't question a thing that's coming out of my mouth
just say the word , i'll tell you what i'm about
they trying to get in my head , and i'm just trying to get out
so it's official , just sign the line with and initial
no matter what you get done , they always try to dismiss you
it ain't a issue , i'll ever care to attend to
i'm out of your fucking league , so i don't need to convince you
sister bessie don't you say no prayers for me
a slow boat's gonna lead me where i'm bound
i'm far to travel far across the distant sea
my destiny will lead me where i'm bound
these haters lining up , go 'head and try my bluff
they seem to multiply , but ain't dividing us
they hate to see us shine , they hate the sight of us
when zeds sent me the beat , they told me light it up
and let the ambers glow , i'm in the amazon
this game changed my approach , i'm like an animal
success is bound to bring it , they hate the fact you're winning
they jealous of it all , they envy that you live it
that's why i play the villain , just trying to excite the story
somebody gotta do it , so i ain't saying sorry
gotta be number one , knew that since i was young
so you could save your pity , cause i ain't fucking done
now i don't sleep , i only trust the deceased
you try and bring it to me , there's something you better see
i am a beast , it's time that you let it be
i'm taking it to the moon , so i am out of your reach , motherfucker
