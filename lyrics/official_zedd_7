great spit , you could tell by my caesar i’m finna go ape shit
the goon who demand for the band put two in symphony
you doomed mentally , i’m who you called out
for saying i’m drawn out , that’s why they tune into me
i make the house sell , i’m who they adore , knock killing
all that hot grillin , get hit with the four man
you in fear to be hurt ?
jerk if this appear to be work , then we can get along , sure man
but if we can’t ? he come back to win , he siamese lunch
chinese crunch , chin smashers , not to chase
get in my rocket space , we’ll send nasa
death , skin grafter , body line , puppet , fuck it i’m the pin master
every round that i come in contact with
show y’all that it’s nothing on the lens crafter
i’m past the faze , church , half god , half man , i’m hercules nigga
i scare the soul , derrick rose , i’m hurting these niggas
please nigga , ya last catch was bass fresh , you who they sent to see
but you the staff rep for bad breath , this shit was meant to be
but it’s cold breath for the old ref , he been official
old ref beneficial nigga you’ll probably die in a year
for the simpleton fans , i’m the michelin man , i body entire careers
wait soldier , don’t panic it’s the planet takeover
the plate holder , i terraform the terror , the goblin killer
y’all know i’m a problem nigga , i’m from the era
when mook , lux left the game with the dead smell
it was passin for a stink
i held up , played zelda , i had everybody asking for the link
jones don’t be phony , homie you know me , we decode the cold truth
i seen the totem pole , i was right there on that golden road too
i’m the same pup from the yellow brick road , but you who i’ma total dog
i black , liberia , the god fearin the guy who meet every criteria
and that’s why i’m the pro to call ( protocol )
now they giving me crazy hugs , baby love , put me on a cupid card

the whole world calling me a stupid star

gun like the matrix too you're right it could reload
dick head done got into a warm mess , you like the pussy hole

moral of the story , when i’m serious serius , you not fuckin with me
lyt…
serius jones
they said “you wanna battle on ether vers’ daylyt ? ”
i said “he gotta be just rap”
but as you can see soon as we get here , it’s like ya outfit
an obvious mismatch
i heard you was gon do some inception thing
ain’t that the beginning of something ? then that’s retarded
cuz off the head this shit done already ended before it started
i heard quill could see the definition to see if quill was representing
but if it’s quill as in penning something ill then that’s forgiving
but it’s not very gangster , in fact it’s not very clever as a nerd
ask mickey if this is facts cuz i dissected the word
and quill is a form in a thin tube and the main tailfeather of a bird
so that’s what you repping on ya neck ? a thin tube or gay bird ?
you mean to tell me a crip from watts
writes his rhymes shaking a tailfeather ? say word
and you must be drinking ink to think day writing is better
oh i get it , you quill cuz your bars they light as a feather
so the queen of the ring wanna be the king of the dots
until you get beamed out of this planet and since ya antics is all a scheme
let’s make a scheme out of ya antics
i did the math on you , try to sleep me on stage i’ll divide you in half
till ya feet get splashed
take them spawn boots off you then ski on ya mask
ya shine is a thriller jacket , zip em up
if you the slave then i’m the master bruh
i’m on the interstate in a challenger with 3 ks
ready to put them white sheets on you so you could stay in character
see you not batman day , you not even bruce wayne you a liar
but i’ll tell you off the bat man , you so marked out
you should change ya last name to mcguire
see you gon die after the shit i say today to day
it’s no more to combat when i put that gun in ya mouth
and say “don’t move” and you say “mkay mkay”
see you a booty shot , i couldn’t sell you light or tell you shake
and if i squeezed on you ya body would wind up so out of place
they could tell you fake
see if you wouldn’t tell not to be ya cell mate
i might could sell you weight
now the doctor’s gon have to wait til cells mate
to make the drugs they gotta help you take
i take this fool to a splash , turn ya bitch into a pool
turn ya food into a bag , dripping through a tube
i get you blue like ya rag when you gripping on the tool
i’m flamed up like ya flag when you bicken back bein bool
you old day , but that’s okay cuz i bought the juice to los angeles
that mean i bring the steel with me , pinch ya bitch up over a q
and they can't even tell who old man quill is
old man quiles , bishop , juice , steel , los angeles
i change ya ceiling but i don’t paint with ladders , these ladders they paint
you try to climb up in my window early morn’
turn spawn to a latter day saint
you can’t pull a wool over a wolf’s eyes , i pull that wool up on em
my bars is so hard , niggas in the yard do pull - ups on em
before y’all came on stage i hope y’all put some pull - ups on em
cuz i’ma pull out on em soon as i pull up on em
see i’m the man that fucked pam in san fran and made the bay - watch
cave gun lines in ya face , you know how tay roc
speaking of roc , i don’t care how chiseled you are
cuz pressure make diamonds but granted
you lost ya marbles , we diggin you
show you how to get cooked on tv , no emeril
do this amber alert ass nigga biblical
oh you don’t see where i’m going here yet ?
i figured since he robbed the culture
so let’s give him the fate of the thief and stone him to death
i’m the one , you got more for us , never can never , that’s ya spaceship
before you take the red pill hit em with a flying knee
yo look like he was doing the matrix
and i wasn’t gon say shit bout this gay shit
but let me get this straight , quick
okay , so you a gangsta and a nerd , you a faggot and you straight
who wears a mask over the mask you already tatted on ya face
so you batman and you’re spawn , you’re daylyt and you’re quill
but you know what that means , if you’re all those you’re nobody for real
i treat this like a drug deal , you might say why
cuz my attitude is like the fiends , never cared if day/they die
i remember when i was young nigga i tested some
i got shook , it had my brain fried
the point of the story is i ain’t get paranoid since i was yay high
ain’t no intervention can tame yo life
you like a coke head with a weak nose
you keep hitting the same line twice
you try to spoon me , i’ma pull the burner on this blue flame
you get tied up , shot , just for being a heroin vein ( hero in vain )
i got that petico , ask lush one , he knows
address me and get violated if i’m p.o.’d
you thought i might slip and maybe lose a round , but no i reload
you about to get 84 grammed , nigga that’s 3 o’d
you go !
in the math battle , you looked like me , yeah you stay fly
what you bout 6’3” ? 6’4” ? 6’4” ?
well after the math punch you was ‘yay’ hi
skill is something i could loan ( cologne ) you , but it might cost nigga
patience , they say it’s hard to give cadence to the fragrance of a lost nigga
but i could tell by ya voice you smell like detroit
that explains why his last round was decent ( d scent )
i mean the man still don’t understand what i’m saying when i say
i’m concrete crippin , but nigga you gon find out what the c meant
let’s put this stone
you ready to rock ? sure let’s get nastier than when they watch borat
based on what my mind crafted it’s gon put everybody in box format
i’m god , it’s true i got em los
punches i land i’m too bahamas los
double bars i’m too guantanamo
piranha flow , snapping , rapping for the long drop , the crew geronimo
you not for the drama , even my mama know , you too comical
it’s crucial , ya crew should vaminos , they gotta know
it’s only one i bitch , in this future i’ma show
in the future i’ma show nobody better
we don’t do gambling with females
the outer stop but the middle will/wheel continue
they like goddamn she on a sprewell/spree well
that’s just the watts route
nigga i seen pop shoot up from the top couch
since a kid i sense zones , it’s the flinstones
nigga i grew up in a rock house
where every second it could happen nigga , k up beside the bed
draw the chrome
i lay up with arms behind my head , i’m karl malone
but i said any second it could happen nigga
pops told me never hesitate to slap a nigga
with the heater boy , it’s vegeta boy , i’ll nap a ( nappa ) nigga
before i befriend you
i mean ya whole team look a lil sweet , they kinda ginyu
i’ll amend you , all you can ( shoryuken ) be flames you tried the ken move
dollar menu , let’s keep it a buck
if the levees break for these geeks , it’s bad luck
we set it straight , i’m kevin gates , i’m just eating his ass up
say hello to daylyt , aka mr. spazz life
if we clash , it’s steve nash , i show you that i’m past nice
but i often wait , off the gate , you’ll find out what i’m fence to do
i chrome round money , i hope that make sense to you
no ? okay , they give jones the start , it’s all play dough

serius jones
that’s cute he came with the fam , but see i’m a forefather
but after son i see why battle rap’s missin me cuz look what they givin me
a nigga reppin crip with the most red flags in battle rap history
but see i don’t just take off , i take offers
it’s too late for daylyt’s savings when i make day darker
see i’m a vampire that ain’t scared of sun
and it’s time somebody put dog on a leash and i’m the day walker
they asked me “why would i take this battle ? ”
i said cuz technically this is the most challenging position to be in
and if you don’t get it then peep then cuz i’ma give y’all the reason
see i been hit up by demons
i done battled in the prisons to the cement
i even last time on stage i had bitches twerkin
y’all see when they shit on the p
but i never been on stage with a nigga that might start
twerking , shitting or peeing
i mean , who raised you my nigga ?
well if it was ya moms then
and it wasn’t them grape street crips and watts’n
i don’t get it cuz i know some killers from bompton
some 60’s from carson , and them jordan down niggas is hard man
and i know they might string yo ass up
but i didn’t know they start letting niggas in thongs in
i can’t believe that over the c’s they ain’t sock you in yo head
for making the set look like some homemade g thang
slow it down , i said i can’t believe that overseas
you had a sock on ya dickhead and a homemade g string
and we know this grape is a fruit
but i don’t know how y’all let him walk through y’all hood
cuz now we know when he say he butt naked with the shotgun
he probably talking bout suge
i don’t see the lyt of day , i heard he was a l evader ( elevator )
well i eat the same rice as ray , so let’s see what they ravin’ bout
cuz when we riding in the streets , some things you can’t just write away
so let’s play a conversation out
let’s say you crip walking down grape street , and see the homies
they deep and like “aye day , come smoke some this cookie it’s real loud”
what you gon say ? “aye wassup cuz , i’m just showing my ass for the set
you know i’m trying to make tookie be proud
you only making noise cuz you a loud ass nigga
you know that “i’m not coming around if that nigga’s around” ass nigga
sir cuz ( circus ) like he the ring master and jump off trampoline
but need tricks to make it through a fire round ass nigga
i think we all know what we call those , clown ass niggas !
this bitch nigga see a gangbang and say “let’s be in” ( lesbian )
drama i bust too , fuck the doc we could go there now
but when the pigs out fox him it’s “momma i love you , pop hold it down”
i don’t see the law , yeah i’m legally blind just like shorty
you get one of mines booked , we wrap ya paperwork around the shank
stick you with ya side of the story
see i shit on stages , you don’t shit on stages
you just be reaching and straining , that’s ya gut
you got a fight going on inside you so i take clips , hit ya soul through ya abs
calm that shit down and break that shit up
and if you still got some og’s aktive , they should be very scared
cuz they macking with wavy jerry hair , and one spray at ya og’s top
activator everywhere
it’s mack in the arena , it’s on mack in the arena
and i brought that mac in the arena
it’s old but it’s still playing yeah that mac’s a ringer
when you get hit , he won’t know if he lost his keys
got hit six times or doing the macarena
my demeanors meaner , i’m kujo , no boris , y’all singers
i make you collapse on stage
you won’t wake up out ya coma til august , alsina
i told you stay on ya toes , but you put on a leotard and a cape
fuck is you a ballerina ?
for awhile now i was tied down by the same ropes i once showed niggas
almost buried by the same shovels i gave gold diggers
for fifth’ers blazing in glory quote jones scriptures
i was smacking cats off camera before smack could even grow whiskers
i put in work ! you job ass niggas is ass
i come through like a backwards moses
cuz after i part this c/sea then i lift up the staff
i feel dre
cuz i would’ve still been on death row if i let my division subtract his ass
but instead of the camera
i put the beats on him on the low so i could get back to stash
that’s how i got shady after math
whats worse than a nigga that gets personal with you and turn on a nigga
these fuckers in the culture got me on fire like ferguson , nigga
and i don’t mean the pigs when they did it
but i take this job cuz this only time
i could kill a nigga in front of the world and get away with it
round 3
daylyt
that’s what’s wrong with these stupid out - of - state niggas
come to cali and be lost’n
you dumb ass nigga , ain’t no 60’s up in carson !
as the bottom stare , this is a step down to the king
we can actually see who the peasant , jones
don’t be mad cuz you got wrapped in a box , nigga
just be happy to be in my presence ( presents )
they said you was gifted when you battled jin
all that mouth drilling and that’s what got ya feelings up
but the difference is you clifford
the world consider you a big dog , but technically you still a pup
but guess what big dog ?
you done stumbled in a puddle of defeat
i peeped ya two paws wet
you better get ready for the chevy cuz , i’m who the crew call vets
but it’s magnificent , this where you get left frozen pussy
cold twat , you know me , my m.o. , g ( emoji )
one small sign could say a whole lot
but you notice first round i ain’t get personal
second round i ain’t get personal , third round we get personal
this where it get gory bro
in my mook voice , everybody wanna know so here’s how the story go
lush one called me , i was getting some head…
he said we got a battle for you & it might involve you getting some bread
i said “who is he ? ” he said “serius” i said “serious ? this nigga dead ! ”
first thing i did was push p. diddy off of the bed
on some real nigga g shit i used to think you was a cold killa
and everything changed right after the “wooo ! ” nigga
you told me verbatimly , before the math battle , you like to squabble
30 minutes into the math battle ya chin got hit , you like to wobble
i seen this cat walk then i seen math run way , you like a model
if it was me he would’ve got a shell over that beef , you like the taco
he would’ve got chipped for the cheese , you like the nacho
the best luck for another stretch truck , you like a tahoe
i would’ve lined up a round for this nigga , you like a waffle
then put that same round next to the chicken , you like the roscoe’s
i would’ve left his face all out of place , you like picasso
then i let it burn in here , you like a hot comb
then i let it ring in the middle of ya face , you like 2pac nose
another serious nigga getting ripped in the middle of the club , you like belasco's
but it’s a difference between cali niggas and y’all niggas
when we get hit we rally niggas , john sally niggas
backshot , ricky in the alley niggas
but the difference between us is these niggas walk up to a person and say
“if you need some help , i got ya”
a cali nigga walk up to you like “aye homie you need some help ? ”
*blocka ! blocka ! *
but a raz on him , it’s time to spaz on him
nigga i’m done with this nigga i’m bout to let the homie spaz on him
vicious get him cuz…
dre vishiss :
two burners , jean and claude , kicking out the van , damn
