k : i know you wanna be real but just it 100
d : we don't wanna hear line , cause you would be actually cool if you were not a lame
you got no views and got no fame
so the sayings true bulletz ain't got no name
cause i mean , we just look at your swag , how you properly dress
how your jeans go up right by your waist , i can see the good in you
he's 50% black , you're 98% white , i don't see the hood in you
you named yourself 100 bulletz after a comic , and look at you
then your main slogan is " guns don't kill people , bulletz do "
it's just one problem , none of those bullets you
that's the name of your bullet , a battle that you won bulletz
i mean honestly , i'm lying
but can you name me in your life if you seen one bullet
if you can , i'ma get the fuck out the venue , run bulletz

are you in pain or are you afraid ?
i have kidney stones
charron :
is it cause your mom's retarded and you look like a stroke victim ?
dna it's a shame , you could randomly vomit at any given time
who'd want to be around you ?
100 : i mean , why name yourself dna when your dna is the worst thing about you
genetically you the saddest victim
that name was a bad decision
that's like big t calling himself " metabolism "
picture this idiot breaking his bars down slow as can be
like , " when i said i'll put that sk on both sides of 'mac
that flow was clean cause that spells " skmacsk
to be honest , i don't really know what that means "
c : when i said i'm on track like a choo - choo bell

cause tracks are on trains so in a way that's pretty ironic

100 : i don't even know what to say
c : when you said " i'm wrapping your father " yours rolled in his grave
100 : i said , you ain't got two arms out cause you air the tec
c : pussy

c : you're supposed to bomb on chess like your own battles
100 : instead you got out of there
c : you got the fuck outta there like your own battles

c : you left dot mobb for nwx , did you get a rhyme promotion ?
100 : yo the professor would leave big t like the klumps when he finds the potion
you moved to writer's bloque , where's your loyalty ? you're blindly loafing
c : for a qp you'd see shine in your window ( innuendo ) like the blinds were open
get your clique the fuck outta here
get that my dot mobb or nwx i can't pick the fuck outta here
get that hannibal lecter , mister dress up shit the fuck outta here
get them corny ass , choreographed kicks the fuck outta here
100 : your battles , i cannot watch

c : i fuck with savages , you fuck boys you can't hang
you can catch me posted up on smack block with my fucking gang
{k - shine knocks charron's gun out of his hands , charron knocks k - shine's hat off , k - shine slaps charron. security steps in}
100 : keep it going
you ain't really 'bout shit , i'll zip him up in his fucking bag
k - shine a pussy , likes trannies in fucking drag
keep going !
k - shine : you slapped my hat
c : you hit my gun , now i really gotcha
