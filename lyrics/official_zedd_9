zeidman beats , another banger for the streets
every other day , niggas gettin' murdered
won't catch me lackin' in the field without my burner
whippin' with this tre - pound , glock work
i brought my big shit , sk stockworth
muzzle on the top of this bitch , them slaus - whistle
ain't none of these niggas fuckin' with me , which i ain't listenin'
i'mma hold it down , rather , rap on the streets shit
do it for the real niggas , i've been through some deep shit
i'm on my last sack , i think i got it from bundles
i don't play in traffic with the cops on my bumper
i'm not pullin' over , that's just me from the jump
i cut the half a brick soft , and i pray that it jump
and all my niggas 'bout it , you can say what you want
this life shit , a gamble , you can play if you want
and i don't call it beef 'till your face to this pump
knock out your teeth , you can't eat for a month
it's hard to tell these youngins put the guns down
when every other night you hear them gun sounds
you hear them gun sounds
i ain't ever lackin' , got my strap right now
it's hard to tell these youngins put the guns down
when every other night you hear them gun sounds
you hear them gun sounds
i ain't ever lackin' , got my strap right now
i got my strap in my holster , you know i'm born ready
i do that drum and that glock , you know i'm comin' heavy
i put that beam on your top , that's head shots
yeah they call me twin lama , straight hitta , that's how i rock
i'm still up in the kitchen whippin' the counter - clock
i'll have my share with them bitches , nigga i'm chasin' guap
black promoter that player put me , i took his watch
i'm still shining off that fuck nigga , thanks a lot
i ain't with the arguing talk homie , i park shit
war time , i brought the whole block , nigga i spark shit
i'm in the kitchen cookin' up , shit i've been official
i'm on my smooth thug shit , balmain's and pistols
look a nigga in his eye , see the bitch in him
pussy nigga , back the heat and pop , droppin' fish in him
i never rock my glock without the stick in it
i can't win , i pop son , they gon' flip on me
it's hard to tell these youngins put the guns down
when every other night you hear them gun sounds
you hear them gun sounds
i ain't ever lackin' , got my strap right now
it's hard to tell these youngins put the guns down
when every other night you hear them gun sounds
you hear them gun sounds
i ain't ever lackin' , got my strap right now
