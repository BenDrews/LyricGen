strictly outta curiosity
what would happen if you got with me ?
kissin' you would hit the spot with me
come on skip a couple rocks with me
give me any of your heart tonight
ain't no reason that we need to be apart tonight
i got something we can start tonight
lookin' at you girl , it's hard to fight
those stars need to be wished on
your skin needs to be kissed on
my eyes baby , they're fixed on you
in your snapback
t - shirt of your favourite rock band
checkin' your makeup in my ray bans
breakin' hearts like only you can
in your snapback
woah - oh - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh - oh
in your snapback
come on baby , shoot a smile at me
midnight selfie on a balcony
a little somethin' for my life screamin'
you're burnin' a hole in my pocket
and we've got the beat , let's drop it
those stars need to be wished on
your skin needs to be kissed on
my eyes baby , they're fixed on you
in your snapback
tattoos , cut - offs , and converse
singin' along to the song with the wrong words
every move you make baby it works
in your snapback
woah - oh - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh - oh
in your snapback
those stars need to be wished on
your skin needs to be kissed on
my eyes baby , they're fixed on you
in your snapback
t - shirt of your favourite rock band
checkin' your makeup in my ray bans
breakin' hearts like only you can
in your snapback
woah - oh - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh - oh
in your snapback
woah - oh - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh - oh
in your snapback
woah - oh - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh - oh
in your snapback
woah - oh - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh - oh
in your snapback
