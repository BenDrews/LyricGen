hey girl , wassup
i know it's late but i knew you'd pick it up
naw , i ain't drunk
okay , maybe i do have a little buzz , but
that song came on and i just thought
what harm could come from one little call
i know you say you're taken but i say
girl you're takin' too long
to tell him that it's over
then bring it on over
stringing him along any longer girl
is just wasting precious time
girl you know it can't wait
rip it off just like a band - aid
the way you look at me , girl , you can't pretend
i know you ain't in love with him
break up with him
i know you don't wanna break his heart
but that ain't no good reason to be
keeping us apart
look , just tell him it's you , it ain't him
and maybe you can lie to him and say you'll
still be friends
whatever you got to say to get through to him
that you ain't in love
c'mon you can't deny that you and i
kinda fit like a glove
so tell him that it's over
then bring it on over
stringing him along any longer girl
is just wasting precious time
girl you know it can't wait
rip it off just like a band - aid
it ain't my business to be all up in
but i know you ain't in love with him
break up with him
i know that you so done with him
break up with him , break up with him
you would've hung up by now
if you weren't thinking it too
no pressure whatever
just do what you gotta do
but if i was you
i'd tell him that it's over
then bring it on over
stringing him along any longer girl
is just wasting precious time
girl you know it can't wait
just rip it off just like a band - aid
yeah , i know i said it but i'll say it again
i know you ain't in love with him
break up with him
the way you look at me girl you can't pretend
i know you ain't in love with him
break up with him
just break up with him
