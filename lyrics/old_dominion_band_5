we are a band of brothers
and native to the soil
fighting for the property
we gained by honest toil ;
and when our rights were threatened
the cry rose near and far -
" hurrah for the bonnie blue flag
that bears a single star ! "
hurrah ! hurrah !
for southern rights hurrah !
hurrah for the bonnie blue flag
that bears a single star
as long as the union
was faithful to her trust
like friends and like brothers
both kind were we and just ;
but now , when northern treachery
attempts our rights to mar
we hoist on high the bonnie blue flag
that bears a single star
first gallant south carolina
nobly made the stand
then came alabama
who took her by the hand
next quickly mississippi
georgia and florida
all raised on high the bonnie blue flag
that bears a single star
ye men of valor , gather round
the banner of the right ;
texas and fair louisiana
join us in the fight
davis , our loved president
and stephens statesmen are ;
now rally round the bonnie blue flag
that bears a single star
and here's to old virginia -
the old dominion state -
who with the young confederacy
at length has linked her fate ;
impelled by her example
now other states prepare
to hoist on high the bonnie blue flag
that bears a single star
then cheer , boys , cheer ;
raise the joyous shout
for arkansas and north carolina
now have both gone out ;
and let another rousing cheer
for tennessee be given
the single star of the bonnie blue flag
has grown to be eleven
then here's to our confederacy
strong are we and brave ;
like patriots of old we'll fight
our heritage to save
and rather than submit to shame
to die we would prefer ;
so cheer for the bonnie blue flag
that bears a single star
