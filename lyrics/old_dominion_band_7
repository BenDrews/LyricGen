we are a band of brothers , and native to the soil
fighting for our liberty , with treasure , blood and
toil ;
and when our rights were threaten’d , the cry rose near
and far
hurrah for the bonnie blue flag , that bears a single
star ! hurrah ! hurrah ! for southern rights , hurrah !
hurrah ! for the bonnie blue flag , that bears a single
star !
as long as the union was faithful to her trust , like
friends and like brethren kind were we and just ;
but now when northern treachery attempts our rights to
mar
we hoist on high the bonnie blue flag that bears a
single star
first , gallant south carolina nobly made the stand ;
then came alabama , who took her by the hand ;
next , quickly mississippi , georgia and florida , all
rais’d on high the bonnie blue flag that bears a single
star
ye men of valor , gather round the banner of the right
texas and fair louisiana , join us in the fight ;
davis , our loved president , and stephens , statesman
rare , now rally round the bonnie blue flag that bears a
single star
hurrah ! hurrah ! for southern rights , hurrah ! hurrah !
for the bonnie blue flag that bears a single star
and heroes to brave virginia ! the old dominion state
with the young confederacy at length has link’d her
fate ;
impell’d by her example , now other states prepare , to
hoist on high the bonnie blue flag that bears a single
star
then cheer , boys , raise the joyous shot , for arkansas
and north carolina now have both gone out ;
and let another rousing cheer for tennessee be given
the single star of the bonnie blue flag has grown to be
eleven
then here’s to our confederacy , strong we are and
brave , like patriots of old , we’ll fight our heritage
to save ;
and rather than submit to shame , to die we would
prefer , so cheer for the bonnie blue flag that bears a
single star
hurrah ! hurrah ! for southern rights , hurrah ! hurrah !
for the bonnie blue flag that bears a single star
