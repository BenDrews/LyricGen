the wheels on the bus go round and round
round and round
round and round
the kids on the bus are tightly bound
all through the town
the driver on the bus goes mad mad mad
mad mad mad
mad mad mad
the knives on the bus go stab stab stab
all through the town
a tisket
a tasket
cut out all that racket
a tisket
a tasket
there's blood in mary's basket
a tisket
a tasket
a red and yellow casket
a tisket
a tasket...
the blood on the bus goes drip drip drip
drip drip drip
drip drip drip
the driver on the bus goes sip sip sip
all through the town
a tisket
a tasket
cut out all that racket
a tisket
a tasket
there's blood in mary's basket
a tisket
a tasket
a red and yellow casket
a tisket
a tasket...
the wheels on the bus go round and round
round and round
round and round
the kids on the bus were never found
all through the town
a tisket
a tasket
cut out all that racket
a tisket
a tasket
there's blood in mary's basket
a tisket
a tasket
a red and yellow casket
a tisket
a tasket...
