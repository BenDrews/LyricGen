i'd kiss your teeth
i'd do your taxes
i'll be your girl
if you weren't a vampire
you look so sharp
in your cloak and slippers
i'd be your girl
if you weren't a vampire
i'd like to go on a picnic with you
but you'll explode in the sun
i'll introduce you to all of my friends
but you always drink their blood
but you always drink their blood
la la la
let's go outside
and chase the squirrels
and drain their blood
because you're a vampire
but you're so sweet
when you're on a feeding frenzy
you looked so fine
when you murdered my whole family
i have a stake
but i swear i wouldn't use it
it's decorative
like the velvet painting of
richard dean anderson
i'd kiss your teeth
i'd do your taxes
i'll be your girl
because you're a vampire
