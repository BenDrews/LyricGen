falling i'm falling
i swim through the desert
i'm drowning i'm drowning
i can't feel my hands
kiss me it's over
red river red rover
a storm in the desert
is one with the sand
walking on water
i sing of my fathers
lobotomy cia
murder and fame
kill me it's over
red river red rover
the free man inherits
a fortune of shame
