when i'm drivin my pick - up
i feel like a man
when i whistle at a lady
i feel like a man
when i'm holdin my shotgun
i feel like a man
but i feel like a little boy
when i'm holdin yer hand
when i'm drankin whiskey
i feel like a man
i'm the king of my castle
when i feel like a man
when i'm whippin my youngins
i feel like a man
but i feel like a little boy
when i'm holdin yer hand
i'm a man's man in a man's world
but you make me blush like a little girl
i wanna pick you flowers and buy you stuff
yer like cold beer can't get enough
when i'm at the hoochie club
i feel like a man
when i see a lady dance
i feel like a man
when i give her that dollar
i feel like a man
but i feel like a little boy
when i'm holdin yer hand
i'm a man's man in a man's world
but you make me blush like a little girl
i wanna pick you flowers and buy you stuff
yer like cold beer can't get enough
