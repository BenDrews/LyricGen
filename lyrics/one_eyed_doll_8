locked in my room
hiding under the bed
can't seem to quiet
the screaming in my head
daddy is drinking
he's angry again
crawl out the window
he'll be out cold by ten
walking downtown
singing songs to myself
wishing that i
could be somebody else
a man on the sidewalk
who's been there since dawn
asks for a dime
and he sings me this song
this town isn't big enough for the two of us
this town isn't big enough for the two of us
this town isn't big enough for the two of us
so goodbye
back at the trailer
it's quiet and dim
daddy's asleep
with a bottle of gin
i see my reflection
in the mirror again
bruises and scars
hows it hurts to be ten
this town isn't big enough for the two of us
this town isn't big enough for the two of us
this town isn't big enough for the two of us
so goodbye
from the shelves that he made
i take a cinderblock
i life it up high
such a heavy rock
above daddy's head
i hold my liberty
as i let it drop
this is what i sing
this town isn't big enough for the two of us
this town isn't big enough for the two of us
this town isn't big enough for the two of us
so goodbye
