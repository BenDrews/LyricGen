in the presence of
kings and queens of silence
secret stardust love
fantasy and science
i knew it wasn’t love
nor was i yours forever
no intentions of
hearts to meld or sever
mirror mirror
what is my gender ?
mirror mirror
mirror mirror
lover pretender
mirror mirror
your lips were warm and real
how could i know you better ?
you showed me how to feel
what a strange endeavor
i’m not alone
the shadows are me
reflections of home
close my eyes to see
mirror mirror
what is my gender ?
mirror mirror
mirror mirror
lover pretender
mirror mirror
