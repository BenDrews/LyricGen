i need another story
something to get off my chest
my life gets kinda boring
need something that i can confess
until all my sleeves are stained red
from all the truth that i've said
come by it honestly i swear
thought you saw me wink , no , i've been on the brink , so
tell me what you want to hear
something that will light those ears
i'm sick of all the insincere
so i'm going to give all my secrets away
this time
don't need another perfect lie
don't care if critics ever jump in line
i'm going to give all my secrets away
my god , amazing how we got this far
it's like were chasing all those stars
who's driving shiny big black cars
and everyday i see the news
all the problems that we could solve
and when a situation rises
just write it into an album
send it straight to gold
i don't really like my flow , no , so
tell me what you want to hear
something that will light those ears
i'm sick of all the insincere
so i'm going to give all my secrets away
this time
don't need another perfect lie
don't care if critics ever jump in line
i'm going to give all my secrets away
got no reason
got no shame
got no family
i can blame
just don't let me disappear
i'm going to tell you everything
tell me what you want to hear
something that will light those ears
i'm sick of all the insincere
so i'm going to give all my secrets away
this time
don't need another perfect lie
don't care if critics ever jump in line
i'm going to give all my secrets away
tell me what you want to hear
something that will light those ears
i'm sick of all the insincere
so i'm going to give all my secrets away
this time
don't need another perfect lie
don't care if critics ever jump in line
i'm going to give all my secrets away
all my secrets away
all my secrets away
