i had a dream the other night
about how we only get one life
it woke me up right after two
i stayed awake and stared at you
so i wouldn’t lose my mind
and i had the week that came from hell
and yes i know that you could tell
but you’re like the net under the ledge
when i go flying off the edge
you go flying off as well
and if you only die once
i wanna die with
you got something i need
in this world full of people there’s one killing me
and if we only die once i wanna die with you
you got something i need
in this world full of people there’s one killing me
and if we only die once i wanna die with you
last night i think i drank too much
yeah , call it our temporary crutch
with broken words i tried to say
honey don’t you be afraid
if we got nothing , we got us
and if you only die once
i wanna die with
you got something i need
in this world full of people there’s one killing me
and if we only die once i wanna die with you
i know that we’re not the same
but i'm so damn glad that we made it to this time
this time now
you got something i need
in this world full of people there’s one killing me
and if we only die once i wanna die with you
