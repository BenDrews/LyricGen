hope when you take that jump
you don't feel the fall
hope when the water rises
you built a wall
hope when the crowd screams out
it's screaming your name
hope if everybody runs
you choose to stay
hope that you fall in love
and it hurts so bad
the only way you can know
it give it all you have
and i hope that you don't suffer
but take the pain...
hope when the moment comes
you'll say
i...i did it all
i...i did it all
i owned every second that this world could give
i saw so many places
the things that i did
yeah , with every broken bone
i swear i lived
hope that you spend your days
but they all add up
and when that sun goes down
hope you raise your cup
oh , oh
i wish that i could witness
all your joy and all your pain
but until my moment comes
i'll say
i...i did it all
i...i did it all
i owned every second that this world could give
i saw so many places
the things that i did
yeah , with every broken bone
i swear i lived
oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
with every broken bone
i swear i lived
with every broken bone
i swear i
i...i did it all
i...i did it all
i owned every second that this world could give
i saw so many places
the things that i did
yeah , with every broken bone
i swear i lived
oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
i swear i lived
oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
