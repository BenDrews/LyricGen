when i was a kid i used to buy and sell gravity
i knew how to fly , and i would teach you for a fee
broke every window in my hotel heart
when i was only five years old
the twelve years scared
but i'd hear the same voice echo in my mind
it'd say , " son , you've got an angel. "
that'd chase the devil out the mind
when i was a kid my grandfather was a preacher
he'd talk about god
yea he was something like a teacher
he said , " god only helps those who learn to help themselves. "
he was a million miles from a million dollars
but you could never spend his wealth
i took a little faith , and put it in a parking lot
i drove to a strange town full of " have " and " have nones "
and as i walked through that story - book life
i've been looking for an angel who'd chase the devil out the mind
ohhhhh
wave. put your hands up and hands down
