i ain't never been the type of spitter on a track
to have a donny murk me and never murk back
cause all i wanna do is see my name at the top
that's why i can't act like i never heard
i've got ears , am i hearing , any pussy test , i will spear him
them man have got one bag of chat
they've got one bag of ps , what you bringing round here
take one shot , hear the bells ringing round here like
who are you blud ? who are they ? what'd you want ?
could've never come around and take man for a punk
could've been sober or drunk
i will grab a don so slam dunk , concrete
but you wanna send dons on me
that's when things start going terribly wrong , g
them are fraud , always tryna con me
well , i'm ready , if it's on , it's on , g
i came and i conquered , i sprayed your sponsors
got a scary flow the same as the monsters
aliens don't even know how i do it
nike air don't even know how i do it
get a reload on the stage like " pull it "
when i get the ball , i know where to put it
i'm a don like frank rijkaard and ruud gullit
stray bullet
i tell a don it ain't funny
that's why i practice , so i stay on point like p money
i tell a don it ain't funny
that's why i practice , so i stay on point like p money
i tell a don it ain't funny

when i was broke , i was better at this
my money got me couple iceburg sweaters in this
when i started , i didn't know i'd get on the list
of mcs who are top flight , spraying on the top mic
ain't done the work but you boast that it's not right
used to waste grams and guns but now i shot right
first ten years , g , i was on a block hype
some mcs are alike , but i'm not like
none of them , and i've had wars with a ton of 'em
nobody's ever gonna do what we done again
put me in any scene , i end up running it
my crew are winners , we end up stunning them
cuh my dons stand on the front line
ready for the war in the cold or the sunshine
you wanna fuck with your game but i run mine
i'll be in the skillzone , bulls - eye , one time
i tell a don it ain't funny
that's why i practice , so i stay on point like p money
i tell a don it ain't funny
that's why i practice , so i stay on point like p money
i tell a don it ain't funny
that's why i practice , so i stay on point like p money , p money
i tell a don it ain't funny
that's why i practice , so i stay on point like p money , p money
yo , a lot of these mcs think they're bad
i held the mac and the mac went mad
this something screaming ratatat
and now you're a myth nobody know , blam
everybody scatters , nobody look back
don't drink loads and think that you're rough , blud
i will show you jack and daniels gassed
