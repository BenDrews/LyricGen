i'm sick of the indi's
watch 'em all look to the left and tell a quick lie
you could be dead broke , tell em i will fix guys
a magician with the weapon when i trick guys
see , when i diss guys , i don't disguise it
and on top of that i don't wear a disguise
i made my girl turn bisexual
so i could fuck your girlfriend with mine
no orgy , my ends still gangbang
new cross , deptford , gang land
lewisham , brockley , gang land
man violate , one word , hangman
lie down for nobody , i don't plank fam
two by four to the head when i plank man
can't scam me with a stupid bank scam
i'll central line you straight to the bank , fam
yeah , i'm a badman
i provide for my family , badman
i've got a young son nicknamed bam bam
fuck with bam bam , guns go bam bam
you're moist like you must've swam , fam
i'm cocaine and your girl nose it
i'm a problem , your girl's problem
well she ain't on my line if she's talking to frank , fam
nah , i'm gassing you
i don't mean i'm gassing you
i mean cs spray to the face , man's gassing you
i'm known to violate while i'm clashing you
forget your twitter beef , man's not @ing you
f your followers , man's not @ing you
boot your door off , dash your latch at you
38 wheelspin and man's remapping you
i ain't having it , bro
i wanna move fast , she ain't having it though
every time we talk about areas , it goes right back to chelsea
ivanovic mode
mortgage money , going mad on these shows
i don't wanna see these man on my road
last man that touched me more than brushed me
don't let me see your hand on my clothes
i swear if you do , i will send out the search party
i ain't talking 'bout search and rescue
i'm talking 'bout search parties that will search parties
don't matter if it's a christian , work or your kid's birth parties
if it's not me and my don then it's gonna be a third party
that'll slap uncles and turf aunties , young or old
there weren't a bucket involved but they all played chicken on road
when i order for the 9 - piece
leave a body with a boneless sidepiece
think you could be like me ? then try , please
wanna walk in my shoes ? can't tell if that's mud or blood
are you sure you wanna try on these ?
rolled our music , tell em i'm a guy on each
ain't the guy to beef , ask about me
when it's war i react quicker than a guy on speed
sleep on who ? are you dumb
every one of my lyrics is deathbeds
are you sure you wanna lie on these ? keep your eye on me
got the img
iron these creases out , check the irony
a one - man team is what you're all tryna be
donny kicked me out the lesson tryna teach me a lesson
so i took out his pupil
now donny can see what it's like with no i in team
