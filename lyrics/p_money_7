i know nothing about cricket
but , when i'm lick him for six its over
you can come with all your man united
i know how to swing with a club , golfer !
let me show you how i say it better
you'll say i'll stick you up like a poster
i'll say i'll put your back against the wallâ€¦wall
poster !
mad !
pushin' out more bread than a toaster
if you're gonna play then play your cards right
don't think you can put what you want , joker !
this girl clocked that i had bare friends
started wonderin' why they keep callin' me loner
saw my money started screaming doh !
that's how i got the nickname homer
mad !
tell the guy at the north pole i'm colder
his girl don't like me but loves my music
'he's a dickhead but he's hard'
boner !
mad !
even on my facebook , i wouldn't poke her
right now p money's taking the mick
pullin' more faces than players in poker ( yes ! )
i be trying to tone up
when i'm in the gym
i never pick the phone up
i say i'm on a diet
but , i ain't gonna lie
when i'm in the whip
i still do donuts...

and the way i'm stackin' this paper
i don't need no barclays account
i need 24 briefcases and a folder ( woop ! )
now i'm gettin' older
i don't bang the instagram poser
but if i had a bb it's game over
caus' i be gettin' more pins than a bowler
to a million , i keep gettin' closer
now i go cinema
where she can order rosette and a meal with dessert
to where she sits and actually watch this film on a sofa...
mad !
food on top from the controller
they're like " p how do you stay sober ?
" you're like the grime version of j hova'

and get me a cup , walk out a legend...

when it comes to the levels

spoke to more majors than a soldier

skates on my feet , bank card in my hand

when it comes to puttin' in work
everybody looks at me
