when they first came out i was like " ok "
everybody else liked it , werent that great
my girlfriend was like me , die hard for the iphone
and then she went and got a bb , " you snaaaake "
no , shut your face and if you're blackberry , i hope yours breaks
you dont have lips anymore , everytime i go to kiss you , you got a curve in your face
i can't take 'em , im like fuck 'em i hate 'em so much i dont even want to touch 'em
she used to love me , now she doesnt
i say i love you , she says nothin
'too busy pinnin her drunken bredrin who right now isnt doin' nothin
her nails get on my nerves and it's like rat - tat - tat - tat when she presses buttons
( oh my days )

and dont give 'em my number , i ain't got a bb i dont care what your pin is lowe it
they think im hatin
'you'll get one too , i doubt it
even if i wanted one , i couldn't get one , cos apparently i ain't allowed it

tryna get me back cos of call of duty
but it wernt that , she was actualy gassed
starin at her phone smiling like it was some cutey
