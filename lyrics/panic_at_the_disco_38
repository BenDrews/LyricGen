i feel the salty waves come in
i feel them crash against my skin
and i smile as i respire because i know they'll never win
there's a haze above my tv
that changes everything i see
and maybe if i continue watching
i'll lose the traits that worry me
can we fast - forward until you go down on me
stop there and let me correct it
i want to live a life from a new perspective
you come along because i love your face
and i'll admire your expensive taste
and who cares ? divine intervention
i want to be praised from a new perspective
but leaving now would be a good idea
so catch me up on getting out of here
can we fast - forward until you go down on me
taking everything for granted
but we still respect the time
we move along with some new passion
knowing everything is fine ( everything is fine )
and i would wait and watch the hours fall
in a hundred separate lines
but i regain repose and wonder how i ended up inside
can we fast - forward until you go down on me
stop there and let me correct it
i want to live a life from a new perspective
you come along because i love your face
and i'll admire your expensive taste
and who cares ? divine intervention
i want to be praised from a new perspective
but leaving now would be a good idea
so catch me up on getting out of here , catch me up on getting out of here
more to the point , i need to show
how much i can come and go
other plans fell through
and put a heavy load on you
i know there's no more that need be said
when i'm inching through your bed
take a look around instead and watch me go
stop there and let me correct it
i want to live a life from a new perspective
you come along because i love your face
and i'll admire your expensive taste
and who cares ? divine intervention
i want to be praised from a new perspective
but leaving now would be a good idea
so catch me up on getting out of here
it's not fair
just let me perfect it
don't want to live a life that was
comprehensive
because seeing clear would be a bad idea
now catch me up on getting out of here
so catch me up , i'm getting out of here
g - g - g - go down on me
can we fast - forward until you go d - d - d - d - down
