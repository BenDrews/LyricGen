spark the blunts up
ash 'em in the ramekins
spark the blunts up
ash 'em in the ramekins
i am chilling heavily
kicking it with my mans and them
get dances from snowbunnies gyrating upon my lap
pop a molly and then black out again
parker posts up
that nigga alex back again
mysterio returneth with the gas again
and masked men
delusion the fuck outta them
and casket them
some rasp , a hint
i'm past the point of giving fucks
nigga give 'em back
niggas , ugh , sicken me
no , i am not finished
sit the fuck down , listen to me
are you listening ?
my pop filter be glistening
rack 'em willie
i hit 'em with holy spirit delivery
feel it ?
they dome fruity ?
i'll peel it
if i so find it appealing
shillings for slivers of your thoughts and your feelings ?
smoke accumulating up around the top of the ceiling ?
see the fucked up - ness i'm concealing ?
we in the cut kickin it tough
so much our minds are congealing
we'll leave a weaker mind reeling
follow the flow , step on the mines that i'm leaving
my rhymes tight when i weave 'em
and they got that bite 'cause i'm seasoned
when i'm on the mic with a reason
and i just ignite like my closet
if so incensed to intensify ( if i ) wanna
shit , if i ? of course i'm gonna
bitch i'm going for blood
and you prob should call a donor
in advance 'cause i'm vashin'
like stampede with a massive dick
( suck it )
now you can say you share my tastes
now you can say you were in my space...suckin' dicks
did you have a ball ?
yoooooouuuu fuckers , i still ain't stuntin a cocksucker
you now listenin to parker
spark your blunts up
it's easy , look...
just roll the green in the brown
lick that shit down
and spark the blunts up
spark the blunts up
ash 'em in the ramekins
spark the blunts up
ash 'em in the ramekins
i am chilling heavily
kicking it with my mans and them
get dances from snowbunnies gyrating upon my lap
pop a molly and then black out again
bored and ill of my mind
how did i pass the time ?
couldn't handle the negativity
instead i drew lines
with no pen and no paper
red wasn't ink , it was sacred
i had so much of it wasted
i swear that i should be anemeic
i didn't do well in school
i was smart as shit , i just hated it
back to school ? mama naw
law , why the fuck did you make the kid ?
friends were just fairweather
and them teachers weren't any better
i was wasted potential
'cause i ain't pick up a pencil
no , not unless i was rhymin'
you see hip - hop was my science
and that weed was a catalyst
the fus ro dah to my skyrim
all of my writing assignments
would have some music behind it
them teachers want you to speak up
right until your voice you find it
but i ain't shut the fuck up since
i'm just recording it now
got a head about my life
i've since reordered it now
livin life by the tao of the buddha's wisdom
and the writings of rza
my mind is an iron fist against a dissenter
sick in the winter
no influenza , just influencers
keep it g in battle like a fencer
don't build your fence up no taller than i
so if it reaches my level
i guess it's clobberin' time
now spark up
spark the blunts up
ash 'em in the ramekins
spark the blunts up
ash 'em in the ramekins
i am chilling heavily
kicking it with my mans and them
get dances from snowbunnies gyrating upon my lap
pop a molly and then black out again
