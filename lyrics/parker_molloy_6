right after you left i got a new bitch
and you depressed you pulled the switch
now you dead my life is ruined
i still had feelings for you eyes of fluid
you gone you must be truely truant
but i liked bad girls bitch you were prudent
yes nigga you’s a nuisance
you ain’t dead you just are wounded
got you again and we so so happy
my other bitch was so so crappy
