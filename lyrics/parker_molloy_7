they think that they know , something 'bout my life
not in the same class , not on the same flight
maybe the same club , just not the same lights
both fucked the same bitch , just not the same night
you just took her phone number
i just took her home with a -
'nother bitch , ménage
boomerang , strange'
lipstick on my collar , oscar de la renta ( y )
your hijo - pequeño , my nachos - bel grande
stay sippin' that andré
spent 3 stacks - that's andré
that balmain , that phillip lim
they say i'm dressing like kanye
i'm everything that my rhymes say :
breadwinner , brand owner
play cloths , millionaire
trendsetter , landowner
hope your bitch don't land on him
drink in his hand with the sand on him
you small time - you hyundai's
y'all couch niggas - we stand on em
dope money with a band on it
half gold , we got a hand on it
d - boys still ball the same
just gotta little bit of glam on it

that was the life i was living , careless about their feelings
caught cheating , ask for forgiveness , of course i got my way
but now i'm older and wiser , cruising through summer days
with a little ma riding in the passenger , she rolling up that lavender
purple cannabis rapture , head high like a jersey in the rafters
you wing a frazier , some smart players until we major
traveling the world , collecting paper , pissing off these haters
come back home and invest in something then ball out later
in five star restaurants high as hell when i tip my waiter
providing for my seed when i bring one in this world
but until that day gets here i'm thinking about these joints , twerk

that's what i call home
feet on the dash , mind on the ass
racin' the sun just so i can get dome
pimped the shorties i've been with
my friends that had me evicted
it's been two years and i'm slippin'
still got no pot to piss in
we have another song , i won't fuckin' feel it
got my eyes on the harley and i'm trying to peel it
had my eyes on the bitch but she married keaton
got no job so i'm hardly eatin'
and you eatin' then we fuckin' beefin'
i need a pie and pizza just to meet up for a fuckin' feature
man , they don't wanna see a nigga
winning in a mothafucka
happier than a mothafucka
you know lightweight grinnin' in a mothafucka
when you're a dead guy and you on that high
so the whole world spinnin' in a mothafucka
and a couple young angels hide their halo
cause they're 'bout to start sinnin' in a mothafucka
they don't wanna see a nigga on the upswing
in a black tux with cufflinks
when you're the reason that every single girl in the party
wanna dance and cuff drinks
when you're the reason that shit gets ran
and mothafuckas wheezin' to keep up with the plan
and the other niggas show up at your function
actin' all anti - social , no , a nigga fan
run up on your mama puttin' money in her hand
and you do that shit again and again and again
pull up in the 8 , goin' home with a 10
and you really can't defend or depend on your friends
ex girlfriend wanna key up the benz
when the sun comes up , nigga we up to win
mothafuck you man , all you do is set trends
and you do that shit again and again and again
ugh , ugh
got those motherfucking custom roshes
feel me ?
this big beard cover my face
until my mother gets her first crib
my hand's on some surf shit
my spanish mami perfect
fuck around and get your father's shirt lift
drop a thousand on some sake and some urchin
swing the dodge viper lefty like i'm randy johnson
hand me the thompson
i'll spill your clams on the carpet
then eat some snails with some garlic
paint the town with a harlot
cream filas and carhartt
three - wheelin out the car lot
put the snorkel on the wrangler cause i'm silly
i chip a little piece of brick into the philly
my daughter's neck is chilly
my son's neck is chilly
my mother wrist so cut
look like it got bit by a grizzly
and these drugs got me spinning like some capoeira
still rock the slow beats with gold teeth
ain't afraid to hold heat
control the jeep
that's for the slow creep

swear this game , you have to know it like the back of your hand
destined to be like superman for as long as you can
wondering what's the purpose without living a life so grand
the worst hand is having the world without a master plan
i feel like you gotta pardon mike for taking over this earth
despite sleepless nights and long flights
and i don't like discussions unless it concerns a price
if you make it out of spite , you still make it so it's alright
i spit magic , so cold and lavish
bad broads perform sexual acts in traffic
so smooth , the saxophone and jazz is
it's horrendous what you lack and focus on what you have in the g
more than average , i'm nothing to test
if it's to me , you step and contest , then bring your best
give it your all , now women beg me to call
and unless we overseas , we don't shop in the mall
