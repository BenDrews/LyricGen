laughing in the face of death
higher than a space cadet
aspire to greater steps
kill the game , i arrive just to pay respect
all that talking you do is cheap you ain't making sense
breaking bread , boy you couldn't break a thread
making threats , boy you couldn't make a friend
take offense , over something someone says you said
get slept , make your bed , no escape , save your breath
k , what's next ? these boys hardly harder
i'm like a modern charlie parker mixed with ali baba
leave these kids more fucked up than that molly got'em
like a lil scrappy song you don't want no problems
sigh idly then reply calmly
lie to me then rely on me
the day is gone this is after - light
but i'm like an old school singer , i'm glad it's night
corbin asked me if i'm scared of dying
the more i think about it i'm kind of excited
maybe that's because my mind is sick and demented
but death ain't shit but a new adventure
death ain't shit but a new adventure
you don't see but i've been holding back
tempted to do off , end it all at that
you can help me if your aim is pure
but there's no medicine , you know the cure
and i could be low , but i fake , it's my fate
ooh , and i could be a low , why wait on
uh
