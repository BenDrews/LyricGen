is there anybody out there
is there anybody waiting
getting sick of your surroundings
all you want is some attention
you can tell the truth
you can tell the lie
say anything you want to say
are we all just lost in time
is there reason not to change
stay the same , become a new thing
walk backwards , step beyond
never forget where we come from
you can tell the truth
you can tell the lie
wonder with what anyone says
we will be alright

straight outta suburbia
straight outta the basement
had another lost weekend
need another vacation
straight outta suburbia
straight outta suburbia

i wear my new clothes
fall down thinking about you
straight out of the dressing room
i wear my new clothes
fall down thinking about you
