coming up to better yourself
i was always with you
only looking for another respite
give away what suits you
i was lost , but you were within
came up when i needed you
don’t be worried that you’re losing it
the more you got they’ll give you
summer was a day
things were looking up
it never felt so good and you weren’t looking for it
summer was was a day
so much further now
you’re going to wait ‘till fall to go home
love goes weak when you won’t escape
lies and broken faces
what a difference another day makes
you never ask the questions
summer was a day
things were looking up
it never felt so good and you weren’t looking for it
summer was was a day
so much further now
i couldn’t be the one to warm your heart
i couldn’t be the one
i couldn’t be the one
i couldn’t be the one
i couldn’t be the one
i couldn’t be the one
i couldn’t be the one
