i’m taking a ride
off to one side
it is a personal thing
where , when i can’t stand
up in this cage i’m not regretting
i don’t need a better thing
i’ll settle for less
it’s another thing for me
i just have to wander through this world
alone
stop
before you fall
into the hole that i have dug here
rest
even as you
are starting to feel the way i used to
i don’t need a better thing
just to sound confused
don’t talk about everyone
i am not amused by you
cause i’m gonna lose you
yes i’m gonna lose you
if i’m gonna lose you
cause i’m gonna lose you
yes i’m gonna lose you
if i’m gonna lose you
i’ll lose you now for good
