in your head , in your head , in your head
it's your head , i'm sorry , i'm sorry
in your head , it's like a desperate song
telling you everything that ya fear can ever go wrong
and i don't wanna try
you convince yourself
no i don't wanna try
i give up too much of myself
give up too much of yourself
in your head , in your head....
i watch you , from the left side of the bed
so beautiful in the morning
in your head , in your head
in your head , in your head , i'm sorry , i'm sorry
in your heart at twilight
it's just just a desolate stone
can't see anything forward
it's like you've already lost
and i don't wanna try
you convince yourself
no i don't wanna try
you give up too much of yourself
you give up too much of yourself....
in your head , in your head....
i watch you , from the left side of the bed
so beautiful in the morning....
