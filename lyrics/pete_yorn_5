verse 1 :
oh baby i dont wanna leave
but they say that i don't really need ya
i'm going on my way i'll be alone , alone
i'm going on my way i'll be alone
oh maybe i'll see you there in my dreams
or maybe we'll turn out enemies
i'm going on my way i'll be alone alone
i'm going on my way i'll be alone
so i go out and talk to a stranger
and i don't have anything to say to her
and i smoke another cigarette
and i find i wake up alone again
chorus :
i'm not the one you should be leaning on
i'm not the one who likes to stay too long
i've had to open up sometimes
just to injure myself
i should be leaving but i'm hanging on
in this world are we just strangers
when we fail to make a connection
and i choke another silhouette
and i find i end up alone again
i'm alone alone alone
i'm alone alone alone...
i'm not the one you should be leaning on
i'm not the one who likes to stay too long
i've had to open up sometimes
just to injure myself
i should be leaving but i'm hanging on
somebody wants to take you away from me
they're thinking of you right now
somebody wants to take you away from me
they got you lined up in their eye...
i've had to open up sometimes just to injure myself
i should be leaving but i'm hanging on
i should be leaving but i'm hanging on
