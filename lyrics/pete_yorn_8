say the talk and i won't mind
if there's a cause
you know i never try
and i love you like
the one i used to know
and if you never have the time
well that's an ordinary problem
and i said i'd like to have a place to go
and you held , and you tried
i could never find another
if you walk me to the car park
i won't go
to my left i saw the tide
flash and fall
it seemed to swallow you
i could love you like the sister
i never had
drawing circles in
your concrete
i will know your every move
and i'll send ya
i'll send ya
and you held and you tried
i could never find another
if you walk me to the car park
i won't go
and we held and we tried
there was hardly lust between us
i will love you
i won't let go
cause we are one inside these walls
undercover
we are one inside these walls
undercover
we are one inside these walls
undercover
we are one in
we are one in
we are one
ohhh
and you held and you tried
i could never find another
if you walk me to the car park
i won't go
and we held and we tried
there was hardly lust between us
i will love you
i won't let go
cause we are one
we are one
we are one
we are one
we are one
