i can take you anywhere
i just want to get to know you
i can take you anywhere
i just want to get to know you
hand on your heart
wind the clock
tomorrow is another day
tomorrow is another day...
there's so much of this world i never see
in front of me
far too much of this world we've never been
forgive me
i can take you anywhere
i just wanna get to know you
i can take you anywhere
i just wanna get to love you
hand on your heart
tomorrow is another day
hand on your hope
tomorrow we will , tomorrow we will get away....
i just wanna get to know you
i just wanna hear you say...
i just wanna get to love you
i just wanna get away
hand on your heart
tomorrow is another day
hand on your hope
tomorrow we will , tomorrow we....
hand on your heart
tomorrow is another day
hand on your hope
tomorrow we will , tomorrow we will get away....
tomorrow is another day
