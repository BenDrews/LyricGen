young vicious , vicious cartel that is
beautiful girls out there , yeah , yeah
from new york alleys , to la freeways
i want y'all rockin' with me ( with me x2 )
from toronto , to el paso
imma' give y'all a site to see
from the carolinas to the chi - town
beautiful girls all around when i touch down
if she a 10 or better , and she's all about her cheddar
then send her my way today ( today x2 )
uh , white , black , jamaican , asian
different locations , pretty in the face and
never bout' chasing , always bout' replacing
it's easy to find a replacement
got these women tracing every move i'm making
why the steady tracking ?
lead em' off the atlas , that quick
if she a dime , then i'm on it till' the morning
chilling , smoking , playing her my tunes
while we're chilling in the room , 5 star after the bar
girl , you're coolin' with a star
so you know just who i are , yep
i was the kid that had it back in the day
now i'm back on the map , and i'm back in my ways
catch me place to place , never slow my pace
keep it pretty while i'm in your city
keep it classy , never trashy , that's what attracts me
gotta love these girls all across the world
i see you eyeing me first
but i be blind to the thirst
you're fly as a bird
so baby we can try if it works
and i ain't lying but i'm tryna' find a line in my words
cause' i desire a finer breed of the lioness herd
so basically i'm patiently waiting to give a hint
never feeling hesitant , gotta get it started
so i'm revin' it , accelerating it quick
your style's dope , so i'm takin' a hit
yeah i know that you ain't easy to get
the others weren't too fine
and you're the type of 10 that's comin' after 1 - 9
so come and vibe , and we gettin' along
the other niggas wanna' talk , but they be tellin' you wrong
i'm trying to get the digits to your cellular phone
it ain't a game , but i dare you to go
and you can start with the area code
life's cold , it's a scarier world
so never fall in love with every girl
