wow ! you lot weren't supporting back in the day. and now you're ringing my phone ? and now you're texting my phone ? allow it
they tried to doubt me now
they thought i weren't about
all the money they used to count
all the times they used to go out
they never holla'd at me now i'm the guy they shout
they never thought i would be where i am today they're clowns !
if you weren't there in my struggle don't be there in my success
not saying that we've succeeded but we aim to be the best
so that's why we write these rhymes
that's why i call this mine
i don't even want to get signed
i just want to stay on my grind !
one day all these haters will know..
we're gonna' blow !
i said we're gonna' blow !
one day all these haters will know..
we're gonna' blow !
i said we're gonna' blow !
they're going to see us in the rolce royce
they're gonna see us in the beamer
it's a 4 door seater , 3.5 litre
getting hot just like a heater
me and p we don't play games
on the beat we go insane
we're going cray , we're going ham
blacked out cars going fast
one day want to drive foreign cars
no car key we just push start , shinning like the star
book the ticket let's go to france
we want ap's and audmiers
who knew i would come this far , in the studio writing these bars
i'm hungry , see the money in my tummy , these broke n*ggas looking bummy
they're laughing like it's funny , online banking no barclays
we want to make it , success yeah we're going to take it
big racks were going to be making
opportunities am going to take it
think it's time for me to blow , i think it's time to make the dough
i want to grow up rich and have kids like my bro
someone once told me there's haters everywhere you go
someone once told me that i got to keep holding on
now i've got a tight grip , i will laugh at all these pricks
looking at me cause i got the salarmis on my wrist ?
your all snakes i hear the hiss
your all dickheads i see you diss
so what am i going to do ?
i'm going to take the piss !
