yo , truth had me up against the ropes
semi - conscious without no boxing skills
fear of it makes hair on my neck grow like minoxodil
watching the clock is ill when faced with the truth , parallels observing amateur video tapes of twenty - one top - notch nypd cops get ill
fill their minds not to kill , still some never revealed true feelings
we're speaking on the truth right now in itself is a healing
see the creator created existence and balance
at right angles , unless it was conceived and stated
so whoever shall stray away from right lives wrong
the deliverance of the word " false " , opposite of truth off course
sure as my slave name sending
troy donald jamerson paves the path , enabling truth
to stay stable and cling to earth
sort of similar to the way static electricity sting see
truth brings light , light refracts off the mirror
visions of yourself and error could never be clearer
the truth is that you ugly , not on the outside
but in the inside , on the outside you fronting , you lovely
the discovery of these things and all are well hidden
but when you in denial of self , it is forbidden
that's the truth
in due time we will find
let the truth be told from young souls that become old
from days spent in the jungle , where must one go to find it ?
time is real , we can't rewind it
out of everybody i met , who told the truth ? time did
we find kids speaking 'cause it's naturally in us
but the false prophets by telling us we born sinners
venders of hate got me battling my own mind state
at a divine rate , i ain't in this just to rhyme great
see the truth in the thighs of a stripper , the eyes of my nigga
if it's only one , then why should it differ ?
so constantly i seek it
wondering why i gotta drink a six - pack to speak it
took a picture of the truth and tried to develop it
had proof , it was only recognized by the intelligent
took the negative and positive , 'cause niggas got to live
said i got to give more than i'm given
'cause truth'll never be heard in religion
after searching the world , on the inside , what was hidden ?
it was the truth
truth , truth , truth , truth , truth , truth
in due time , we will find
check it , on my neck i still got marks from the nooses
the truth it produces , fear that got niggas on the run like carl lewis
the truth is my crew is the smoothest spitters of saliva juices
like the roots is , more organic than acoustics
heavenly , what will set you free and kill you in the same breath
that shit you gotta get off your chest before your death
unless the way you speak is lighter than a pamphlet
'cause the truth give the words the weight of a planet , god damn it
i ran with what god planted in my heart and i understand it
to be to bring some light to the dark , breathe some life in this art
this must be the truth ( why ? )
'cause we keep marching on ( true )
the truth lay the foundation of what we rocking on ( true )
you can't see it if you blind , but we will always prevail ( true )
life is like the open sea , the truth is the wind in our sail
and in the end , our names is on the lips of dying men
if ever crushed to the earth , we always rise again
when the words of lying men sound lush like the sound of a violin
the truth is there , it's just the heart you gotta find it in
you will find , you will find , you will find
you will find , you will find , you will find
you will find
