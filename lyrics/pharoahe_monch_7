ooh , listen to the way i slay your crew
damage , damage , damage , damage
they cock them hammers , wave them llamas
but that's that in front of the camera drama
so when the cameras are attached to dollys , i call them dali lama's
mold me , loathe , hold me in the palm of your hand , load me
you know exactly what i am , murderer
when i'm inserted on to the top of fifteen family members
it's the curse of the proverbial anarchy starter , the martyr
this is what i have been converted to do what i do is insanity
pro - fo - fo - fanity when they manually hammer me annually
you dont figitty faze me yo
i won't tigitty tase you bro
figgity fucking cut you in half like it's nothing minus the laser scope
then i will ring your bell like avon
before displaying some of my various tattoos ( trayvon )
the ( oscar ) award winning ( aiyana jones ) hey ( sean )
sworn to be cannon fodder for your father slaughter daughters
armor piercing tumblers more deadlier than napalm
fuck a stray bullet , i take aim when the gun draws
for ever - lasting fame i will maim those who change the gun laws
cause post traumatic stress disorder , ask any vet i've worked with
my purpose catching bodies like safety nets at the circus
nigga i will twist your liver like oliver ( twist )
scratch your name off my calendar
see that was me thru a silencer
what you just heard was a .44 caliber
now you can fill in the blanks
i will pillage your town
killing them with dillinger rounds
nigga fill in the clip cause i'm willing to flip
see i'm sort of certified , i'm fortified live
you would be mortified if i would put on screen what i've seen
horrified holy bibles , rivals , vital organs
little bitty baby bodies , bridal gowns coffins
morphine , gang bang , gangrene , slauson , swap meet
meet greet , pop i don't sleep , i don't stop
i love hate , hate cops
that's why i laugh when you pull it
i'm motivated and crass
i'm so elated when i see them on the news ( you fuckin' pigs ! )
they flying the flag half mass
see there's no need for conversation
when we're discussing the bullet's point of view
