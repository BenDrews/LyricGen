welcome to the age of aquarius in the stages of various schemes
precariously i escape when i dream
each scene should win an academy , put it up on the screen
my strategy : pharoahe's the king of queens
who fiends for teens to view it as the new theme music
use it to shape their futures when they daydream to it
never elusive , never claim stupid
lucid , boost your recruits when you sing to it and just.. dream
( that means you )

five o'clock in the morning , just getting home from last night's performance
when i'm dead tired from touring i hit the coffin
i'm like a vampire required to stay dormant
out of the range , the sunlight with a doubt it'd remain
i used to smoke so much weed that it clouded my brain
i took a break , had to find life's meaning again
without the smoke in my lungs i started dreaming again
i dreamed of candy - coated cars and panties that go with bra's
hurricanes named sandy , i'm floating on noah's ark , what ?
police'll bleed blue cause he staying true to the uniform
dennis rodman in north korea looking for unicorns ( that's ridiculous )
the truth is i'm one of the best
and when you snooze that's when you meet the cousin of death
so when i say i never visited the cousin , i don't sleep
i stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep ( dream )
i've got dreams to remember
i've got dreams , yeah dreams to remember
help me out
