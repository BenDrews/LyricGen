hold on to me
don't let me go
who cares what they see
who cares what they know ?
your first name is free
last name is dom
cause you still believe
in where weâ€™re from
man's red flower
it's in every living thing
mind , use your power
spirit , use your wings
freedom !
freedom !
freedom !
freedom
freedom
freedom
hold on to me
don't let me go
cheetahs need to eat
run , antelope
your first name is king
last name is dom
cause you still believe
in everyone
when a baby first breathes
when night sees sunrise
when the whale hops the sea
when man recognizes
freedom !
freedom !
freedom !
freedom
freedom
breathe in
we are from heat
the electric one
does it shock you to see
he left us the sun ?
atoms in the air
organisms in the sea
the sun and yes , man
are made of the same things
freedom !
freedom !
freedom !
freedom
freedom
freedom
freedom
freedom
