different
this one goes out to all the lovers
what can we do ? we're helpless romantics
we can not help who we're attracted to
so let's all dance , and elevate each other
dear diary , it's happenin' again
this energy , like i'm 'bout to win
i just close my eyes and visions appear
she's everything i want , and it's crystal clear
not even marilyn monroe
who ? cleopatra ? please
not even joan of arc
that don't mean nothin' to me
i just want a different girl
girl , girl , girl , girl
girl , girl , can't another good boy keep it this thorough
why , why do i have to lie ?
pretend , make believe or hide her ?
when i love what i've described
but then again , i don't need no adjectives for this girl
dear diary , it's happenin' again

i just close my eyes and visions appear
she's everything i want , and it's crystal clear
not even marilyn monroe

girl , girl , girl , girl

what's wrong with that ?
what's wrong with that ? yeah
what's wrong with that ?
in honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it
we say thank you , and we take it back
wished so hard , i wished so hard that it came true
then my lucky star , i guess you came from behind the moon
i put my arms around her , and i promise not to abuse you
since now i found you , why the hell would i want to lose you ?
