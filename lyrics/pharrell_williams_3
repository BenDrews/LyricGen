you find yourself trying to do my dance
maybe cause you love me ( uh , you do it well )
so then we tried - singing it slow now
because you weren't used to how fast we touched ( fast we touched )
then we locked eyes - and i knew i was in there
and i was gonna tear your ass up ( tear your ass up )
i know that i'm carrying on
never mind if i'm showing off
i was just frontin' ( you know i want you babe )
i'm ready to bet it all
unless you don't care at all
but you know i want ya ( you should stop frontin' babe )
trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
but still you sneak and look at me , and girl i love it
then you give your other girl a shove
tell her you gonna call her ass how it was
and she's gonna love it ( whoa - oh whoa , yeah yeah )
