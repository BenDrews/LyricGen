my heart is filled , with love and care
not an ounce of gas , i would get up there
the answer's simple
you lift me up
the view up here , i see all the stars
there go venus , and there go mars
somethin' you been through
you're from above , hey
when i first saw you , i got excited
tried to keep my composure , tryna hide it
but i didn't know
i didn't let go
then it occurred to me while tryna fight it
just like a kite , you learn to ride it
but i didn't know
you s'posed to let it go
like a gust of wind
you head me off sometimes
like a gust of wind
you push me back every once in a while
like a gust of wind
you remind me there's someone up there
who ushers in
the air i need to power my sail
when i open the window
i wanna hug you
cause you remind me of the air
i said yeah
cause when i'm feelin' real low
i remember i love you
i put my hands in the air
and you were there
with your love , i can board the skies
riding away that electrified mothership other
can i stow away ? ( can i stow away girl , girl ? )
colourful winds of the northern sky
is the closest thing , and here is why
cause we're color
you blow me away ( blow me away girl , girl )
i need it like i breathe it
music and colors can make one hover
who cares if they don't see you ?
don't you know that they're the same ?
i need it like i breathe it
if you never discover , forever you'll suffer
who cares if they don't see you ?
you gotta tap in and learn the way
like a gust of wind
you head me off sometimes
like a gust of wind
you push me back every once in a while
like a gust of wind
you remind me there's someone up there
who ushers in
the air i need to power my sail
when i open the window
i wanna hug you
cause you remind me of the air
i said yeah
cause when i'm feelin' real low
i remember i love you
i put my hands in the air
and you were there
when i first saw you , i got excited
tried to keep my composure , tryna hide it
but i didn't know
i didn't let it go
then i realized i'm trying to fight it
just so they can learn to ride it
but i didn't know , oh
i had to let it go
like a gust of wind
you head me off sometimes
like a gust of wind
you push me back every once in a while
like a gust of wind
you remind me there's someone up there
who ushers in
the air i need to power my sail
when i open the window
i wanna hug you
cause you remind me of the air
i said yeah
cause when i'm feelin' real low
i remember i love you
i put my hands in the air
and you were there
