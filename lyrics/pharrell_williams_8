my love , ooo
my love
a winner never quits
and a quitter never wins
i thought about what i wanted
and you were on my list
remember where i was ?
in the desert with no love
no cactuses , just dust
and you swept me from above
my love
so i just wanna say
thank you for this day
cause it is so good
good morning , you got me feelin' ( brand new )
you got me feelin' ( brand new )
like the tag's still on me
got the tags still on me
jumpin' 'round in your bag
jumpin' 'round in your bag
so good morning , ooh girl
you are the feeling i'm jammin' to ( brand new )
you are the feeling i'm jammin' to ( brand new )
like the tag's still on me
got the tags still on me
my love , ooo
my love
life to me is easy
people make it complicated
when love is the tool
no reason we can't make it
come on , let's go , be brave
feel somethin' that they'll praise
once we know that we're made
then give it all the way
my love
so i just wanna say
thank you for this day
cause it is so good
good morning , you got me feelin' ( brand new )
you got me feelin' ( brand new )
got the tags still on me
jumpin' 'round in your bag
jumpin' 'round in your bag
so good morning , ooh girl
you are the feeling i'm jammin' to ( brand new )
you are the feeling i'm jammin' to ( brand new )
like the tag's still on me
got the tags still on me
all my life , when i describe
what i want , i've been misunderstood
the more i try , at bein' satisfied
and didn't think that i could
but then you came along , and you made me strong
like god said you would
so i just wanna say
thank you for this day
cause it is so good
good morning , you got me feelin' ( brand new )
you got me feelin' ( brand new )
got the tags still on me
jumpin' 'round in your bag
jumpin' 'round in your bag
so good morning , ooh girl
you are the feeling i'm jammin' to ( brand new )
you are the feeling i'm jammin' to ( brand new )
like the tag's still on me
got the tags still on me
