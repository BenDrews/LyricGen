i know who you are , and i know what you're feelin'
bad day , at work , crazy boss , crazy hours
finger , pointin' , but they , they depend on you
inhale , exhale , in and out , like a sail
no no , aw yes , smile honey , no stress
when your environment seems to get brighter
you know it's good
and the situation doesn't seem that bad
you know it's good
can you imagine this started with a lighter ?
you know it's good
perception that you never had
you know it's good
you know who you are , and i know what you're feelin'
( i want every woman to make a pledge with me )
say your name , i pledge , to live life , on the edge
want you to know , i see , the power , is in me
no more , acquiesce , standin' up , with no stress
will do , what i need , 'til every woman on the earth is free
let me tell you all one time
i don't mind
i know what you're feelin'
feelin' , feelin'
and girl don't let them tell you that you don't deserve to unwind
and if they don't want to join us , cool , but it's our time
we just shake our heads , and dance , the moment so surreal
isn't it sad ? there's people in this world that don't know how this feels
