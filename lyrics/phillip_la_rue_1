you've been searching , your whole life
for what’s been right in , front of your eyes
you've been rolling , turning
like the sea
oh restless heart , when will you be…
but…
if you’re tired , of fighting on your own
if you’re tired , of feeling all alone
i'll be your home
i’ll be your home
i wish you could see , you through my eyes
you'd feel yellow , orange , open skies
you've been rolling , turning
like a stone
oh restless heart , just let go...
so…
if you’re tired , of fighting on your own
if you’re tired , of feeling all alone
i'll be your home
i'll be your home
i'll be your home
i'll be your home
i'll be your home
i'll be your home
i'll be your home
i'll be your home
i'll be your home
i'll be your home
i'll be your home
i'll be your home
i'll be your home
