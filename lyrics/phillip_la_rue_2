you got a hold on me
i've never felt like this before
just let go of me
i think i'm better off on my own
one minute , i'm walking away
the next , i'm on my face
begging for your sweet touch
begging for your sweet grace
i can't be with or without you
i can't stay but i won't run
and i hate the way that i need you
but please don't hold back your love
i can't stay but i won't run
your love is beautiful
but it breaks me down to my knees
your love is wonderful
but i'm scared of the mystery
one moment my hands are fists
the next , their open again
begging for your sweet touch
i need your sweet touch
i can't be with or without you
i can't stay but i won't run
and i hate the way that i need you
but please don't hold back your love
i can't stay but i won't run
i can't be with or without you
i can't stay but i won't run
and i hate the way that i need you
but please don't hold back your love
i said please don’t hold back your love
i can't stay but i won't run
i won’t run
i can’t stay but i won’t run
