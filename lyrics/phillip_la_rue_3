you cannot see but youâ€™re inches away from the ledge
the canyons may call but don't you dare listen to them
the earth , it may quake and your heart may break but know
i am where i stand and i will not let you go
cause i will carry you , carry you , carry you away from it all
i won't let you fall
cause i will lift you up , lift you up , lift you up into the light
don't close your eyes till the morning
and let it all begin , oh let it all begin
the wind on your back , a sonnet above your soul
there's so much you view that you still need to know
the rain , it is falling like a river sweet
i'm hoping the current will lead you right back to me
cause i will carry you , carry you , carry you away from it all
i won't let you fall
cause i will lift you up , lift you up , lift you up into the light
don't close your eyes till the morning
and let it all begin , oh let it all begin
i will carry you , carry you , carry you away from it all
i won't let you fall
cause i will lift you up , lift you up , lift you up into the light
so don't close your eyes till the morning
and let it all begin
let it all begin 4x
