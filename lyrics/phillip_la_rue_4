when i see you , i see wild horses
fenced in , never knowing the mountain side
when i see you , i see the open ocean
bordered in , always waiting on the tide
but it never comes
when i see you , i see a wild fire
waiting on , a sip of kerosene
cause i know , i know , i know
there’s a lot inside you
that’s brighter than this world has ever seen
they just don’t see it yet
but i do , i do , sister
and i’d do , i’d do anything for you
when i hold you , i feel like i’m holding glass
i’m so scared , in the morning it might break
when i hold you , i’m holding all i passed
all the dreams , of long yesterdays
when we gonna see you
when we gonna see you alive
when we gonna see you
when we gonna see you alive
i just wanna see
i just wanna see you turn to light
when heaven’s gates open up and let you in
this place is gonna lose its greatest gift
they just don’t see it yet
but i do , i do , sister 2x
and i’d do , i’d do anything for you
anything for you
when i see you , i see wild horses
