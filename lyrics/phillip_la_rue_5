steady as you go
keep your eyes upon the shoreline
i know that you'll fight the tide
i can feel your winds are changing
steady as you go
and wait upon the morning light
don't you dare close your eyes
cause i can see your white sail coming
i know that you are dying to be found
so let me be your light house
don’t let the waves
pull you now away from me
i’m asking you to just believe
trust me there’s a silver lining
can you hear the land
and the rhythm of its whispering
maybe hope is all you need
maybe it’s in this heart that’s beating , beating
i know that you are dying to be found
so let me be your light house
no , i won’t let you be
i won’t let you be lost at sea
i won’t let you be
i know that you are dying to be found
so let me be your light house 2x
