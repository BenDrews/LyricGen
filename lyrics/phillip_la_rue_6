my body's like sandstone
you’re blinking your eyes closed
your body's a temple
the only one i've known…
is you , there's something ‘bout you
when you’re next to me
when you’re next to me
every touch we make
its sets off a new flame
feels like a brush fire
its taking me higher…
it’s you , there's something ‘bout you
when you’re next to me
when you’re next to me
your body like quarter moon
you’re falling like a satellite
in my eyes
in my eyes
in my eyes
i cradle you soft and slow
time take your time , time take your time tonight
time take your time tonight…
you , there's something ‘bout you
when you’re next to me
when you’re next to me
when you’re next to me
you , it’s all about you
when you’re next to me
when you’re next to me
oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh…
