heaven’s gates , are behind your eyes
and i see your face , every time there’s orange skies
it’s a miracle , that you even found me
and there’s a miracle in about everything
oh..
did you know that
it’s your love , it's your love , it's your love
that keeps me walking on
it’s your love , it's your love , it's your love
it's your love , it's your love
that keeps me moving on
it’s your love , it's your love
your sweet , sweet love
your sweet , sweet love
with just a glimpse , you taught me how to see
with just a touch , you brought me to my knees
i surrender
i surrender
i surrender
i was just a heart looking for a fault line
i wanted to fall , i wanted to fall
it’s your love , it's your love , it's your love
that keeps me walking on
it’s your love , it's your love
did you know that ?
it’s your love , it's your love , it's your love
that keeps me moving on
it’s your love , it's your love
your sweet , sweet love
your sweet , sweet love
it’s your love , it's your love , it's your love
it's your love , it's your love
your sweet love
it’s your love , it's your love , it's your love
that keeps me moving on
it’s your love , it's your love , it's your love
heaven’s gates , are behind your eyes
and i see your face , every time there’s orange skies
