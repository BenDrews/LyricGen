memories are like falling leaves
they’re blowing in the wind
you try but you can't catch them
and it lies in her eyes
the days they move too fast
you to try to make them last
but they keep on moving , like a river
to the ocean , always rolling
let it love , let it go , tell me we’ll , always be
tell me now , say it’s so , say it’s so , say it’s so
let it love , let it go , tell me we’ll , always be
tell me now , say it’s so , say it’s so , say it’s so
feel her touch
hear her breathe
watch her move
in her sleep
every second sets to frame
oh my god
not one
is the same
feel the choir
and its whisper
hold on tighter
time’s a killer
we’ll outrun it you and i
we’ll outrun it only if we try
tonight
leave
but it keeps on moving , like a river
to the ocean , it’s always rolling
let it love , let it go , tell me we’ll , always be
tell me now , say it’s so , say it’s so , say it’s so
