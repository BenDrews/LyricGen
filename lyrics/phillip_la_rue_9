i wish you could live every day the same way twice
you’d get a second chance to remember , oh yes you would
i wish you could live every day the same way twice
that way you could laugh or cry , or whatever you wanted to...
but you'd remember....
diane , do the best you can
oh , diane lets me hold her hand
we reminisce about her past
same stories turning over and over
and right when i don't think it will last
her laugh keeps pulling me closer
oh diane , do the best that you can
why does the mind sometimes trick itself so well
one moment you remember , then the next not so well
and why can't the heart just help you hold onto
all those moments that mean so much to me and you...
it's ok , it’s okay...
diane , just do the best you can
oh , diane lets me hold her hand.
we reminisce about her past
same stories turning over and over
and right when i don't think it will last
her laugh keeps pulling me closer
oh , diane did the best that she can
diane , i'll hold onto you if you hold onto me 2x
diane , just do the best you can
oh , diane lets me hold her hand.
we reminisce about her past
same stories turning over and over
and right when i don't think it will last
her laugh keeps pulling me closer
her eyes keep pulling me closer
her smile keeps pulling me closer
her heart keeps pulling me closer
oh , diane did the best that she can
diane , i'll hold onto you if you hold onto me
just keep on talking , keep on talking
and i'll hold onto you if you hold onto me
just keep on talking , keep on talking
