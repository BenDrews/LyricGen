tale of nur al - din ali and his son
'when he who is asked a favour saith " to - morrow , " * the wise man wots 'tis vain to beg or borrow.' "
" travel ! and thou shalt find new friends for old ones left
&nbsp behind ; * toil ! for the sweets of human life by toil and
&nbsp moil are found :
the stay - at - home no honour wins nor aught attains but want ; * so
&nbsp around !
i've seen , and very oft i've seen , how standing water stinks , *
&nbsp and only flowing sweetens it and trotting makes it sound :
and were the moon forever full and ne'er to wax or wane , * man
&nbsp would not strain his watchful eyes to see its gladsome
&nbsp round :
except the lion leave his lair he ne'er would fell his game , *
&nbsp except the arrow leave the bow ne'er had it reached its
&nbsp bound :
gold - dust is dust the while it lies untravelled in the mine , *
&nbsp and aloes - wood mere fuel is upon its native ground :
and gold shall win his highest worth when from his goal ungoal'd ;
&nbsp * and aloes sent to foreign parts grows costlier than gold. "
when it was the twenty - first night ,
that jetty hair , that glossy brow ,
&nbsp my slender - waisted youth , of thine ,
can darkness round creation throw ,
&nbsp or make it brightly shine.
the dusky mole that faintly shows
&nbsp upon his cheek , ah ! blame it not :
the tulip - flower never blows
and as another also said : —
his scent was musk and his cheek was rose ; * his teeth are pearls
&nbsp and his lips drop wine ;
his form is a brand and his hips a hill ; * his hair is night and
&nbsp his face moon - shine.
they named the boy badr al - din hasan and his grandfather , the wazir of bassorah , rejoiced in him and , on the seventh day after his birth , made entertainments and spread banquets which would befit the birth of kings' sons and heirs. then he took nur al - din and went up with him to the sultan , and his son - in - law , when he came before the presence of the king , kissed the ground between his hands and repeated these verses , for he was ready of speech , firm of sprite and good in heart as he was goodly in form : —
" the world's best joys long be thy lot , my lord ! * and last while
&nbsp darkness and the dawn o'erlap :
o thou who makest , when we greet thy gifts , * the world to dance
" grow thy weal and thy welfare day by day : * and thy luck
&nbsp prevail o'er the envier's spite ;
and ne'er cease thy days to be white as day , * and thy foeman's
&nbsp day to be black as night ! "
in his face - sky shines the fullest moon ; * in his cheeks' anemone
&nbsp glows the sun :
he so conquered beauty that he hath won * all charms of
&nbsp humanity one by one.
the professor brought him up in his father's palace teaching him reading , writing and cyphering , theology and belles lettres. his grandfather the old wazir had bequeathed to him the whole of his property when he was but four years of age. now during all the time of his earliest youth he had never left the house , till on a certain day his father , the wazir nur al - din , clad him in his best clothes and , mounting him on a she - mule of the finest , went up with him to the sultan. the king gazed at badr al - din hasan and marvelled at his comeliness and loved him. as for the city - folk , when he first passed before them with his father , they marvelled at his exceeding beauty and sat down on the road expecting his return , that they might look their fill on his beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace ; even as the poet said in these verses : —
as the sage watched the stars , the semblance clear
of a fair youth on 's scroll he saw appear.
those jetty locks canopus o'er him threw ,
and tinged his temple curls a musky hue ;
mars dyed his ruddy cheek ; and from his eyes
the archer - star his glittering arrow flies ;
his wit from hermes came ; and soha's care ,
( the half - seen star that dimly haunts the bear )
kept off all evil eyes that threaten and ensnare ,
the sage stood mazed to see such fortunes meet ,
in this world there is none thou mayst count upon * to befriend
&nbsp thy case in the nick of need :
so live for thyself nursing hope of none * such counsel i give
&nbsp thee : enow , take heed !
the second behest is , o my son : deal harshly with none lest fortune with thee deal hardly ; for the fortune of this world is one day with thee and another day against thee and all worldly goods are but a loan to be repaid. and i have heard a poet say : - -
take thought nor hast to win the thing thou wilt ; * have ruth on
&nbsp man for ruth thou may'st require :
no hand is there but allah's hand is higher ; * no tyrant but
&nbsp shall rue worse tyrant's ire !
the third behest is , learn to be silent in society and let thine own faults distract thine attention from the faults of other men : for it is said : —in silence dwelleth safety , and thereon i have heard the lines that tell us : —
reserve's a jewel , silence safety is ; * whenas thou speakest many
&nbsp a word withhold ;
for an of silence thou repent thee once , * of speech thou shalt
&nbsp repent times manifold.
&nbsp becoming one of those who deem it ill :
&nbsp gateway wide to sins that kill.
the fifth behest , o my son , is keep thy wealth and it will keep thee ; guard thy money and it will guard thee ; and waste not thy substance lest haply thou come to want and must fare a - begging from the meanest of mankind. save thy dirhams and deem them the sovereignest salve for the wounds of the world. and here again i have heard that one of the poets said : —
when fails my wealth no friend will deign befriend : * when
&nbsp wealth abounds all friends their friendship tender :
how many friends lent aid my wealth to spend ; * but friends to
&nbsp lack of wealth no friendship render.
on this wise nur al - din ceased not to counsel his son badr al - din hasan till his hour came and , sighing one sobbing sigh , his life went forth. then the voice of mourning and keening rose high in his house and the sultan and all the grandees grieved for him and buried him ; but his son ceased not lamenting his loss for two months , during which he never mounted horse , nor attended the divan nor presented himself before the sultan. at last the king , being wroth with him , stablished in his stead one of the chamberlains and made him wazir , giving orders to seize and set seals on all nur al - din's houses and goods and domains. so the new wazir went forth with a mighty posse of chamberlains and people of the divan , and watchmen and a host of idlers to do this and to seize badr al - din hasan and carry him before the king , who would deal with him as he deemed fit. now there was among the crowd of followers a mameluke of the deceased wazir who , when he heard this order , urged his horse and rode at full speed to the house of badr al - din hasan ; for he cold not endure to see the ruin of his old master's son. he found him sitting at the gate with head hung down and sorrowing , as was his wont , for the loss of his father ; so he dismounted and kissing his hand said to him , " o my lord and son of my lord , haste ere ruin come and lay waste ! " when hasan heard this he trembled and asked , " what may be the matter ? ; and the man answered , " the sultan is angered with thee and hath issued a warrant against thee , and evil cometh hard upon my track ; so flee with thy life ! " at these words hasan's heart flamed with the fire of bale , and his rose - red cheek turned pale , and he said to the " mameluke , " o my brother , is there time for me to go in and get me some worldly gear which may stand me in stead during my strangerhood ? " but the slave replied , " o my lord , up at once and save thyself and leave this house , while it is yet time. " and he quoted these lines : —
" escape with thy life , if oppression betide thee , * and let the
&nbsp house of its builder's fate !
country for country thou'lt find , if thou seek it ; * life for
&nbsp life never , early or late.
it is strange men should dwell in the house of abjection , * when
o thou whose forehead , like the radiant east , * tells of the
&nbsp stars of heaven and bounteous dews :
endure thine honour to the latest day , * and time thy growth of
&nbsp glory ne'er refuse !
" this house , my lady , since you left is now a home no more * for
&nbsp me , not neighbours , since you left , prove kind and
&nbsp neighbourly :
the friend , whilere i took to heart , alas ! no more to me * is
&nbsp friend ; and even luna's self displayeth lunacy :
you left and by your going left the world a waste , a wolf , * and
&nbsp lies a gloomy murk upon the face of hill and lea :
o may the raven - bird whose cry our hapless parting croaked *
&nbsp find ne'er a nesty home and eke shed all his plumery !
at length my patience fails me ; and this absence wastes my
&nbsp flesh ; * how many a veil by severance rent our eyes are
&nbsp doomed see :
ah ! shall i ever sight again our fair past nights of your ; * and
&nbsp shall a single house become a home for me once more ? "
when it was the twenty - second night ,
a sun on wand in knoll of sand she showed * clad in her
&nbsp cramoisy - hued chemisette :
of her lips honey - dew she gave me drink , * and with her rosy
&nbsp cheeks quencht fire she set.
then they changed that dress and displayed her in a robe of azure ; and she reappeared like the full moon when it riseth over the horizon , with her coal - black hair and cheeks delicately fair ; and teeth shown in sweet smiling and breasts firm rising and crowning sides of the softest and waist of the roundest. and in this second suit she was as a certain master of high conceits saith of the like of her : —
she came apparrelled in an azure vest , * ultramarine , as skies
&nbsp are deckt and dight ;
i view'd th' unparrellel'd sight , which show'd my eyes * a moon
&nbsp of summer on a winter - night.
then they changed that suit for another and , veiling her face in the luxuriance of her hair , loosed her lovelocks , so dark , so long that their darkness and length outvied the darkest nights , and she shot through all hearts with the magical shaft of her eye - babes. they displayed her in the third dress and she was as said of her the sayer : —
veiling her cheeks with hair a - morn she comes , * and i her
&nbsp mischiefs with the cloud compare :
saying , " thou veilest morn with night ! " " ah , no ! " * quoth she ,
&nbsp " i shroud full moon with darkling air ! "
then they displayed her in the fourth bridal dress and she came forward shining like the rising sun and swaying to and fro with lovesome grace and supple ease like a gazelle - fawn. and she clave all hearts with the arrows of her eyelashes , even as saith one who described a charmer like her : —
the sun of beauty she to sight appears * and , lovely - coy , she
&nbsp mocks all loveliness ;
and when he fronts her favour and her smile * a - morn , the sun of
&nbsp day in clouds must dress.
then she came forth in the fifth dress , a very light of loveliness like a wand of waving willow or a gazelle of the thirsty wold. those locks which stung like scorpions along her cheeks were bent , and her neck was bowed in blandishment , and her hips quivered as she went. as saith one of the poets describing her in verse : —
she comes like fullest moon on happy night ; * taper of waist ,
&nbsp with shape of magic might :
she hath an eye whose glances quell mankind , * and ruby on her
&nbsp cheeks reflects his light :
enveils her hips the blackness of her hair ; *beware of curls that
&nbsp bite with viper - bite !
her sides are silken - soft , the while the heart * mere rock behind
&nbsp that surface lurks from sight :
from the fringed curtains of her eyne she shoots * shafts which
&nbsp at farthest range on mark alight :
when round her neck or waist i throw my arms * her breasts repel
&nbsp me with their hardened height.
ah , how her beauty all excels ! ah how * that shape transcends the
&nbsp graceful waving bough !
then they adorned her with the sixth toilette , a dress which was green. and now she shamed her slender straightness the nut - brown spear ; her radiant face dimmed the brightest beams of full moon and she outdid the bending branches in gentle movement and flexible grace. her loveliness exalted the beauties of earth's four quarters and she broke men's hearts by the significance of her semblance ; for she was even as saith one of the poets in these lines : —
a damsel 'twas the tirer's art had decked with snares and
&nbsp her had borrowed light :
she came before us wondrous clad in chemisette of green , * as
&nbsp veiled by its leafy screen pomegranate hides from sight :
and when he said " how callest thou the manner of thy dress ? " *
&nbsp she answered us in pleasant way with double meaning dight ;
" we call this garment creve - coeur ; and rightly is it hight , * for
&nbsp a sprite ! "
in vest of saffron pale and safflower red * musk'd , sandal'd
&nbsp ambergris'd , she came to front :
" rise ! " cried her youth , " go forth and show thyself ! " * " sit ! "
&nbsp said her hips , " we cannot bear the brunt ! "
and when i craved a bout , her beauty said * " do , do ! " and said
&nbsp her pretty shame , " don't , don't ! "
" by allah , set thy foot upon my soul ; * since long , long years
&nbsp for this alone i long :
and whisper tale of love in ear of me ; * to me 'tis sweeter than
&nbsp the sweetest song !
no other youth upon my heart shall lie ; * so do it often , dear ,
&nbsp and do it long. "
visit thy lover , spurn what envy told ; * no envious churl shall
&nbsp smile on love ensoul'd.
merciful allah made no fairer sight * than coupled lovers single
&nbsp couch doth hold ;
breast pressing breast and robed in joys their own , * with
&nbsp pillowed forearms cast in finest mould :
and when heart speaks to heart with tongue of love , * folk who
&nbsp would part them hammer steel ice - cold :
&nbsp for that friend , that friend in heart enfold.
o ye who blame for love us lover kind * say , can ye minister to
&nbsp diseasèd mind ?
when it was the twenty - third night ,
" i see their traces and with pain i melt , * and on their whilome
&nbsp homes i weep and yearn :
and him i pray who dealt this parting - blow * some day he deign
" love in my heart they lit and went their ways , * and all i
&nbsp love to furthest lands withdrew ;
and when they left me sufferance also left , * and when we parted
&nbsp patience bade adieu :
they fled and flying with my joys they fled , * in very
&nbsp consistency my spirit flew :
they made my eyelids flow with severance tears * and to the
&nbsp parting - pang these drops are due :
and when i long to see reunion - day , * my groans prolonging sore
&nbsp for ruth i sue :
then in my heart of hearts their shapes i trace , * and love and
&nbsp longing care and cark renew :
o ye , whose names cling round me like a cloak , * whose love yet
&nbsp closer than a shirt i drew ,
beloved ones ! how long this hard despite ? * how long this
&nbsp severance and this coy shy flight ? "
when i nighted and dayed in damascus town , * time sware such
&nbsp another he ne'er should view :
and careless we slept under wing of night , * till dappled morn
&nbsp 'gan her smiles renew :
and dew - drops on branch in their beauty hung , * like pearls to be
&nbsp dropt when the zephyr blew :
&nbsp and the clouds set points to what breezes wrote.
" if not master of manners or aught but discreet * in the
&nbsp household of kings no trust could he take :
&nbsp angels would serve for his service sake. "
&nbsp her not : she ne'er was made for justice :
take what she gives thee , leave all grief aside , * for now to
&nbsp fair and then to foul her lust is. "
" i wander 'mid these walls , my layla's walls , * and kissing this
&nbsp and other wall i roam :
'tis not the walls or roof my heart so loves , * but those who in
&nbsp this house had made their home. "
" i ask of you from every rising sun , * and eke i ask when
&nbsp flasheth levenlight :
when i pass my nights in passion - pain , * yet ne'er i 'plain me
&nbsp of my painful plight ;
my love ! if longer last this parting throe * little by little
&nbsp shall it waste my sprite.
an thou wouldst bless these eyne with sight of thee * one day on
&nbsp earth , i crave none other sight :
think not another could possess my mind * nor length nor breadth
&nbsp for other love i find. "
then he walked on till he came to the apartment of his brother's widow , the mother of badr al - din hasan , the egyptian. now from the time of her son's disappearance she had never ceased weeping and wailing through the light hours and the dark ; and , when the years grew longsome with her , she built for him a tomb of marble in the midst of the saloon and there used to weep for him day and night , never sleeping save thereby. when the wazir drew near her apartment , he heard her voice and stood behind the door while she addressed the sepulchre in verse and said : —
" answer , by allah ! sepulchre , are all his beauties gone ? * hath
&nbsp change the power to blight his charms , that beauty's
&nbsp paragon ?
thou art not earth , o sepulchre ! nor art thou sky to me ; * how
&nbsp comes it , then , in thee i see conjoint the branch and moon ? "
while she was bemoaning herself after this fashion , behold , the wazir went in to her and saluted her and informed her that he was her husband's brother ; and , telling her all that had passed between them , laid open before her the whole story , how her son badr al - din hasan had spent a whole night with his daughter full ten years ago but had disappeared in the morning. and he ended with saying , " my daughter conceived by thy son and bare a male child who is now with me , and he is thy son and thy son's son by my daughter. " when she heard the tidings that her boy , badr al - din , was still alive and saw her brother - in - law , she rose up to him and threw herself at his feet and kissed them , reciting these lines : —
" allah be good to him that gives glad tidings of thy steps ; * in
&nbsp very sooth for better news mine ears would never sue :
were he content with worn - out robe , upon his back i'd throw * a
&nbsp heart to pieces rent and torn when heard the word adieu. "
" i longed for my beloved but when i saw his face , * abashed i
&nbsp held my tongue and stood with downcast eye ;
and hung my head in dread and would have hid my love , * but do
&nbsp whatso i would hidden it would not lie ;
volumes of plaints i had prepared , reproach and blame , * but
&nbsp when we met , no single word remembered i. "
and then said he to them , " heal my broken heart and eat of my sweetmeats ; for , by allah , i cannot look at thee but my heart flutters. indeed i should not have followed thee the other day , but that i was beside myself. " " by allah , " answered ajib , " thou dost indeed love us ! we ate in thy house a mouthful when we were here before and thou madest us repent of it , for that thou followedst us and wouldst have disgraced us ; so now we will not eat aught with thee save on condition that thou make oath not to go out after us nor dog us. otherwise we will not visit thee again during our present stay ; for we shall halt a week here , whilst my grandfather buys certain presents for the king. " quoth hasan of bassorah , " i promise you this. " so ajib and the eunuch entered the shop , and his father set before them a saucer - full of conserve of pomegranate - grains. said ajib , " sit thee down and eat with us , so haply shall allah dispel our sorrows. " hasan the bassorite was joyful and sat down and ate with them ; but his eyes kept gazing fixedly on ajib's face , for his very heart and vitals clove to him ; and at last the boy said to him , " did i not tell thee thou art a most noyous dotard ? ; so do stint thy staring in my face ! " but when hasan of bassorah heard his son's words he repeated these lines : —
" thou hast some art the hearts of men to clip ; * close - veiled ,
&nbsp far - hidden mystery dark and deep :
o thou whose beauties sham the lustrous moon , * wherewith the
&nbsp saffron morn fears rivalship !
thy beauty is a shrine shall ne'er decay ; * whose signs shall
must i be thirst - burnt by that eden - brow * and die of pine to
" i still had hoped to see thee and enjoy thy sight , * for in
&nbsp thine absence life has lost its kindly light :
i swear my vitals wot none other love but thine * by allah , who
&nbsp can read the secrets of the sprite ! "
when it was the twenty - fourth night ,
" long have i wept o'er severance ban and bane , * long from mine
&nbsp eyelids tear - rills rail and rain :
and vowed i if time re - union bring * my tongue from name of
&nbsp " severance " i'll restrain :
joy hath o'ercome me to this stress that i * from joy's revulsion
&nbsp to shed tears am fain :
ye are so trained to tears , o eyne of me ! * you weep with
when he had ended his verse his mother came in and threw herself upon him and began reciting : —
" when we met we complained , * our hearts were sore wrung :
but plaint is not pleasant * fro' messenger's tongue. "
" the first in rank to kiss the ground shall deign * before you ,
&nbsp and all ends and aims attain :
you are honour's fount ; and all that hope of you , * shall gain
&nbsp more honour than hope hoped to gain. "
the sultan smiled and signed to him to sit down. so he took a seat close to his uncle , shams al - din , and the king asked him his name. quoth badr al - din hasan , " the meanest of thy slaves is known as hasan the bassorite , who is instant in prayer for thee day and night. " the sultan was pleased at his words and , being minded to test his learning and prove his good breeding , asked him , " dost thou remember any verses in praise of the mole on the cheek ? " he answered , " i do , " and began reciting : —
" when i think of my love and our parting - smart , * my groans go
&nbsp forth and my tears upstart :
he's a mole that reminds me in colour and charms * o' the black
the king admired and praised the two couplets and said to him , " quote something else ; allah bless thy sire and may thy tongue never tire ! " so he began : —
" that cheek - mole's spot they evened with a grain * of musk , nor
&nbsp did they here the simile strain :
nay , marvel at the face comprising all * beauty , nor falling
&nbsp short by single grain. "
allah bless thy days ! " so he began : —
" o you whose mole on cheek enthroned recalls * a dot of musk
&nbsp upon a stone of ruby ,
grant me your favours ! be not stone at heart ! * core of my heart
&nbsp whose only sustenance you be ! "
say thou to skin " be soft , " to face " be fair , " * and gaze , nor
&nbsp shall they blame howso thou stare :
fine nose in beauty's list is high esteemed ; * nor less an eye
&nbsp full , bright and debonnair :
eke did they well to laud the lovely lips * ( which e'en the sleep
&nbsp of me will never spare ) ;
&nbsp seemly union of gifts rarest rare :
but beauty's acme in the hair one views it ; * so hear my strain
&nbsp and with some few excuse it ! "
mine is a chief who reached most haught estate , * treading the
&nbsp pathways of the good and great :
his justice makes all regions safe and sure , * and against
&nbsp froward foes bars every gate :
bold lion , hero , saint , e'en if you call * seraph or sovran
the poorest supplicant rich from him returns , * all words to
&nbsp praise him were inadequate.
he to the day of peace is saffron morn , * and murky night in
&nbsp furious warfare's bate.
bow 'neath his gifts our necks , and by his deeds * as king of
allah increase for us his term of years , * and from his lot avert
&nbsp all risks and fears !

there is no more honest man than the turkish peasant or the private soldier ; but the process of deterioration begins when he is made a corporal and culminates in the pasha. moreover official dishonesty is permitted by public opinion , because it belongs to the condition of society. a man buys a place ( as in england two centuries ago ) and retains it by presents to the heads of offices. consequently he must recoup himself in some way , and he mostly does so by grinding the faces of the poor and by spoiling the widow and the orphan. the radical cure is high pay ; but that phase of society refuses to afford it.
