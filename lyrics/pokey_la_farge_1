last night i dreamt you were a glass of rioja
wine we drank on the first night we met
if you could cross my tongue , and trace through my veins
you could have gone with me on the morning i left
oh , la meva maca senorita
you danced the sardana , bare feet on the floor
and when you get tired lay your head on my chest
please hear my song , don’t you cry no more
chorus :
oh , my heart is a bird that sings while you’re gone
la - da - da - da - da , da - da - da - da - da
the loneliest song that you’ve ever heard
la - da - da - da - da , da - da - da - da - da
goodbye , barcelona , so glad i’ve been shown ya
i’m going , i’m leaving the land of the sun
for the far north where i don’t want to go
where the rain it stops for no one
but i’m bringing a bottle of rum
i was just thinking about my return
temptation like oranges lies ripe on the vine
sagrada familia grows taller each year
like my love for you that grows stronger with time
chorus
solo
