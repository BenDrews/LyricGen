something’s wrong honey , this i know
never seen you this way before
hey baby , i wanna be your man
i can tell you need a friend
step aside , won’t you let me in
hey baby , who do you think i am ?
chorus :
it’s late and it’s ‘bout to pour
your neighbor’s tired of me hanging round your door
i’ll say one thing and nothing more
i wanna be your man
some people don’t like me hanging around
but there’s no reason for that i’ve found
hey baby , please don’t look so sad
when you’re all alone and you need a hand
let me come into your house and be your handyman
hey baby , what about the fun we’ve had ?
bridge :
i can tell you’ve had a long day
why don’t we smoke something , take the pain away
it’s okay , i’ll be your shelter from the storm
don’t let your demons take control
let me rock you with a steady roll
it’s cold , baby , won’t you come and keep me warm ?
chorus
