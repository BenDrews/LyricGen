a hurricane is brewing in the east
while forest fires rage in the west
but when the new madrid line
breaks our poor spine
that’s it , there isn’t anymore
tornadoes twisting in the south
while a blizzard blows down from the north
when them old tectonic plates
set off the big earthquake
cities will crumble from shore to shore
so get ready , i get ready
listen everybody , can’t you hear that sound ?
from the underground , can’t you hear that sound ?
from the underground , can’t you hear that sound ?
the end won’t come from disease
and it won’t be from any nuclear bomb
the ground beneath our feet
will rise up to meet the fire in the sky , becoming one
if there is a god , he’s of the land
and he does not favor any man
father time has the final say
but it doesn’t matter anyway
mother nature has made a deal and now it’s done
