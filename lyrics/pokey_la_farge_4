when did you leave heaven , heaven ?
when did you leave heaven ?
how could they let you go ?
how's everything in heaven ?
i'd like to know
why did you trade heaven
for all these earthly things ?
where did you hide your halo
and where did you lose your wings ?
have they missed you ?
can you get back in ?
if i kissed you , would it be a sin ?
you know he's only human
yes , baby you're so divine , yes
when did you leave heaven ?
