where have all the good girls gone ?
was there ever one ?
they will win you with their eyes
then trap you in their thighs
stay away from love , stay away , boys
far away , far away , far away
far away , far away , far away
as the lights of home draw near
there’s a black cat at my door
and he spoke to me
in a manner low and mean
she ain’t here , she ain’t here , she ain’t here , oh no
far away , far away , far away
far away , far away , far away
mother and my sisters three
forgive these words i speak
for all them pretty , pretty girls
with their lips and their curls
have robbed my pride from me , dear mom
far away , far away , far away
far away , far away , far away
where have all the good girls gone ?
was there ever one ?
they will win you with their eyes
then they’ll trap you in their thighs
stay away from love , stay away , boys
far away , far away , far away
far away , far away , far away
