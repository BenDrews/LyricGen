well the lights are on , it’s time to go
gotta hit the stage for another show
knockin’ the dust off the rust belt tonight
i started out , all by myself
but i’m lucky now that i’ve found some help to
knock the dust off the rust belt tonight
chorus :
have you seen what’s happenin’ round here ?
you ask most people , they don’t care
but now is the time we have to do things right
so we’re knockin’ the dust off the rust belt tonight
from the c - h - i to the s - t - l
i was born raise a ruckus and do it well
knockin’ the dust off the rust belt tonight
take a jazz band with a country beat
it’s midwestern swing for your dancin’ feet
we’re gonna knock the dust off the rust belt tonight
chorus
a newspaperman said it couldn’t be done
but i lived it , i wrote it , in a song i sung
knockin’ the dust off the rust belt tonight
this ain’t your momma and your daddy’s midwest
we have what it takes to stand the test
knockin’ the dust off the rust belt tonight
chorus
