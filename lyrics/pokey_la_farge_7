keep your angel wings on tight , babe
wear your halo proudly , too
you can try your best to behave
but i know you have the devil inside of you
chorus :
my mom said that she thought you were part angel and part saint
but you’re quite used to convincing people of everything you ain’t
you’re a bad girl , you’re a bad girl
soon they’ll all be on to you
you can wear white to your wedding
ask the preacher to bless your soul
but when you see st. peter at them pearly gates
you won’t have what it takes to pay the toll
chorus
you’re a bad girl , you’re a bad girl
soon they’ll all be on to you
you’re a bad girl , you’re a bad girl
soon they’ll all be on to you
oh , keep your angel wings on tight , babe
yes that’s what an evil girl would do
you’re just a bad girl
that’s what an evil girl would do
you’re a bad girl
