if it’s not where you’re from
but what you had where you happened to come from
more or less i’d say that i had none
eatin’ and drinkin’ would be all that i do
and if it’s not what you do
but what you got , then i got less
and out of loving or playing , i like loving the best
now baby , take me with you when you go
chorus :
take me to the bridge where the rivers collide
down in cairo , illinois on a saturday night
i might jump in
everyone wants to hear a song
that helps the day seem half as long
but i’m trying
i want you to see that i’m trying , babe
if you’ve lost your ticket to paradise
or you spent your money for the bus
it’s cold coffee in the morning , slow trumpet at dusk
now baby , catch that old midnight train
chorus :
i want you to hear that i’m trying , babe
down by the levee
where you swear god’s got you shamed
just cast your doubts and the mistakes that you’ve made
into that old wishing well , well well well well
don’t the river look lonesome at twilight ?
well , there ain’t no looking back
it’s just a broken fiddle and an old tote sack
in the morning you’ll be going south
chorus
i want you to feel like i’m trying , babe , oh yes , i want you to know that i’m trying
