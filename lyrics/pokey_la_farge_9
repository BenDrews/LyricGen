well , i was laying in the dark
when i felt a spark , suddenly come over me
as the feeling got stronger
i could no longer , get myself back to sleep
the melody was flowing , and the rhythm started growing
i , guess it had to be from my soul
cause if it feels right , it’s like love at first sight
when it hits you , then you know
chorus :
it’s the spark , when you get it , you know you got it
it’s the spark , when you don’t know you want it
yes , you know you gotta have the spark
i started buzzin’ like a phone
rattling my bones , and shaking dust off my wings
i set my eyes towards the sky , as the sun started to rise
i was so high , i thought i could fly
and i just might dare , but my baby might care
disturbing her at such a time
i’ll keep it close to the vest till i can get it off my chest
and sing it with a friend of mine
chorus
solo
chorus x 2
yes , you know you gotta have the spark
mmm , you know you gotta have the spark
