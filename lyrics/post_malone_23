she said , " love me , " so i love her
she said , " leave me , " so i left
then i went to california
and i ain't never comin' back
i gotta high five from a brother
i got bloodstains on the bed
and i ain't sayin' that i love her
but this bitch is gonna drive me mad
i said this bitch is gonna drive me mad ( ah - ah - ah - ah - ah - ah )
you got just what i been looking for
but you can't bring yourself to say no
and i ain't never gonna let you go
i kept wishing i would die , oh
the whole plane ride home
and i wish i could
i know i should leave you alone
i worship since i met you
i fell down to my knees
and when no one would accept ya
throw myself up on a cross and bleed
i seen a dark cloud coming over
i seen some evil shit in her head
but she rode me like no other
but this bitch is gonna drive me mad
i said this bitch is gonna drive me mad ( ah - ah - ah - ah - ah - ah )
you got just what i been looking for
but you can't bring yourself to say no
and i ain't never gonna let you go
i kept wishing i would die , oh
the whole plane ride home
and i wish i could
i know i should leave you alone
you got just what i been looking for
but you can't bring yourself to say no
and i ain't never gonna let you go
i kept wishing i would die , oh
the whole plane ride home
and i wish i could
i know i should leave you alone
