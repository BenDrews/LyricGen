and if you play with my money , your mom gon' miss you
i started throwin' a tantrum , so i copped me a phantom
and every time she gets mad , i throw the keys to the jag
broke niggas call me materialistic
we do not ball the same , you're still learnin' how to pivot
since i got rich , i don't drink beer
leave the mall , leave a trail of tears
i told my son don't have no fears
if he ever feels down we can take off in the leer
we could be gone tomorrow , love today
