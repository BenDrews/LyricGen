ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh - ooh
ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh - ooh , ooh
and i've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
i can't even leave my bedroom so i keep pouring
and i ain't seen a light of day since , well that's not important
it's been long
and i was feeling whitney , me and my homies sip houston
cars and clothes , thought i was winning
you knew i was losing
you told me to wake up , oh my clock always stays on snooze
and i'm done
to each their own and find peace in knowing
ain't always broken , but here's to hoping
show no emotion , against your coding
and just act as hard as you can
you don't need a friend
boy , you're the man
ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh - ooh
ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh - ooh
ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh - ooh , ooh
and i've been looking for someone that i can buy my drugs from
it seems like every plug ran east to utah , became mormons drought comes around , feels like i have no one to depend on
sober , ugh
i had 80 beers on tuesday night , i had nothing to do with it
i put on a little dwight and sang a happy tune
and lit a cigarette , stepped out the door , had an appearance
drank more
to each their own and find peace in knowing
ain't always broken , but here's to hoping
show no emotion , against your coding
and just act as hard as you can
you don't need a friend
boy , you're the man
ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh - ooh
ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh - ooh
ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh - ooh , ooh
