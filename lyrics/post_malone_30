woke up in a hot tub , spillin' moet , in the water
then i light my marijuana , take a shot up out the choppa
j's jumpin' out the locker , spend a little guapa
she want candy , aaron carter
i called her candy when i saw her , pull up with my brothers
candy - painted flyin' saucer , test me , you'll get flyin' colors
hunnid bitches coming up the steps
turn the front lights on , when i know they on they way
she said she don't wanna do too much drugs
believe me , baby , i do this shit like every day like every day
she don't want a thing , i don't want a thing
she come over , pop a couple beans
and that's it , and that's it
she don't want a thing , i don't want a thing
she come over , pop a couple beans
and that's it , and that's it
wanna talk about them martins ? , do you wanna talk about them jordans ?
enjoy a 40 every mornin' , everclear and some recordin'
101 , on the 101 like jeff gordon , i just popped a pill , she just popped a pill
and we might just pop some more , i ain't stoppin' 'til like 20
up until like 4 , smartwater like some dummies
taking shots up out the semi , that shit kill me like i'm kenny
oh , bitches walking down the steps
turn the front lights off , got a blunt all to myself
no i don't want all this shit to get too deep
but listen baby , there ain't no shit with you and me
no " you and me , " no
she don't want a thing , i don't want a thing
she come over , pop a couple beans
and that's it , and that's it
she don't want a thing , i don't want a thing
she come over , pop a couple beans
and that's it , and that's it
