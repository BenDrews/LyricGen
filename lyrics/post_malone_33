everybody want to do the most

and i might pull up in a mercedes
with 16 gold teeth in my face
and you know if i want it i'mma get it
and if i owe you something i'mma pay it
if you want to say something then say it
if you want to try the jewels , make my day
i got n'sync dancing on my neck
and these cubans cost a motherfucking check
got boy bands like i'm lance bass
so pretty 'lil momma come my way
