full lyrics will be available upon release. stay tuned !
watch how i do it on tv , i know when and how to montage
cocaine on the table , liquor pourin' , don't give a damn
don't you cuff it , she's a groupie , she just tryna get in
sayin' i'm with the band
ay , ay , now she actin' outta pocket
tryna grab up from my pants
i got bitches in my trailer sayin' i ain't got a man
and they all brought a friend
yeah , ay
i've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
man i feel just like a rockstar
all my brothers got the gas n' they
always be smokin' like
