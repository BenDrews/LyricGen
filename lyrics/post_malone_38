i'm in a four door down rodeo
i'm getting fucked up , i'm losing control
i'm bumping fleetwood , she tryna turn off my song
she keep asking where the party at
i got a flask full of vodka in my passenger seat
my homie got a mansion says that we could crash it for free
we gotta take the phones because we can't let nobody see
we pop a pill since you ain't have not a thing to eat
thunder only happens when it's raining
and players only love you when they are playing
say women , they will come and they will go
when the rain washes you clean you will know
you will know
you will know
you will know
you will know
cuz i got dreams , don't hold me down
so i'mma let you free , don't wanna hold you out
i'mma leave when the sun comes
thunder only happens when it's raining
and players only love you when the're playing
say women , they will come and they will go
i thought that i would learn by now
i thought that i would never come down
just last night we was going so hard
but now i can't feel my heart
let me down easy , don't let me down rough
don't let me go to sleep , getting up is gon' be tough
they was all actin sleazy , they all said i was the one
and with any damn luck , i'mma wake up with the sun
hope i wake up with the sun this morning
i hope i wake up with the sun this morning
and let it pour , let it pour , let it pour let me roll
man , i'm on a roll i'm so up in my zone
they thought that i was fuckin done with iverson
but i'm still ballin on these bitches , let them know
i just want everything , i want it all in advance
they just want me to call it quits
ho we just roll up a cig
lil posty don't fuck with y'all
never been fuckin with y'all
we pull up they standing in awe
yeah your bitch she know who we are
i thought that i would learn by now
i thought that i would never come down
just last night we was going so hard
but now i can't feel my heart
let me down easy , don't let me down rough
don't let me go to sleep , getting up is gonna be tough
they was all actin sleazy , they all said i was the one
and with any damn luck , i'mma wake up with the sun
hope i wake up with the sun this morning
i hope i wake up with the sun this morning
