every day i wake up , i hope i'm dreamin'
i can't believe this shit
can't believe you ain't here
sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
it's hard to just keep goin'
it's like i feel empty inside without you bein' here
i would do anything man , to bring you back
i'd give all this shit , shit the whole lot
i saw your son today , he look just like you
you was the greatest , you'll always be the greatest
i miss you b.i.g
can't wait til that day , when i see your face again
i can't wait til that day , when i see your face again
yeah , this right here ( tell me why )
goes out to everyone that has lost someone
that they truly loved ( c'mon , check it out )
seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
i laced the track , you locked the flow
so far from hangin' on the block for dough
notorious , they got to know that
life ain't always what it seem to be
words can't express what you mean to me
even though you're gone , we still a team
through your family , i'll fulfill your dream ( that's right )
in the future , can't wait to see
if you open up the gates for me
reminisce some time , the night they took my friend
try to black it out , but it plays again
when it's real , feelings hard to conceal
can't imagine all the pain i feel
give anythin' to hear half your breath
i know you still livin' your life after death
every step i take , every move i make
every single day , every time i pray
i'll be missing you
thinkin' of the day when you went away
what a life to take , what a bond to break
i'll be missin' you
it's kinda hard with you not around
know you in heaven smilin' down
watchin' us while we pray for you
every day we pray for you
'til the day we meet again
in my heart is where i'll keep you , friend
memories give me the strength i need to proceed
strength i need to believe
my thoughts big i just can't define
wish i could turn back the hands of time
us in the six , shop for new clothes and kicks
you and me takin' flicks
makin' hits , stages they receive you on
still can't believe you're gone
give anything to hear half your breath
i know you still livin' your life after death
every step i take , every move i make ( i miss you )
every single day , every time i pray
i'll be missing you
thinkin' of the day when you went away
what a life to take , what a bond to break
i'll be missin' you
somebody tell me why
one black morning
when this life is over
i know i'll see your face
every night i pray , every step i take
every move i make , every single day
every night i pray , every step i take
every move i make , every single day
every night i pray , every step i take
every move i make , every single day
every night i pray , every step i take
every move i make , every single day
every step i take , every move i make ( i miss you )
every single day , every time i pray
i'll be missing you
thinkin' of the day when you went away
what a life to take , what a bond to break
i'll be missin' you ( we miss you )
every step i take , every move i make ( i miss you )
every single day , every time i pray
i'll be missing you
thinkin' of the day when you went away
what a life to take , what a bond to break
i'll be missin' you
