i'm only here for that green paper with the eagle
i'm strictly tryin' to cop those colossal - sized picasso's
and have papi flip coke outside delgado's
mienda , with cash flowin' like sosa
and the latin chick transportin' in the chocha
stampedin' over , pop mo's , never sober
lex and range rovers dealin' weight by minnesota
avoidin' narcs with camcorders and chevy novas

undercover donnie brasco
left my east coast girl the bentley to twirl
my west coast shorty push the chrome 740
rockin' redman and naughty , oh , where my kitty cat ?
half a brick of yay in the bra where her titties at
and i'm livin' that for life , we push weight
fuck the state pen , fuck hoes at penn state
listen close , it's francis , the praying mantis
attack with the mac , my left hand spit
right hand grip on the whip for the smooth getaway
player haters , get away or my lead will spray
squeeze off 'til i'm empty , don't tempt me

it's all about the benjamins , baby
