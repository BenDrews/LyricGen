where you from , where that at
where you heading , what is that
what you doing , feeling that
get that fucking cake up , open your mind
keep your distance unless you wanna get with this
me and the renegade , black grenade , blowin' up mines , diamond's blue
chop it like sumo
nigga hungry like cujo
smoking that pluto
no ticking time like hand on the rope
nigga feel beautiful
no park brake but a nigga in neutral
you wanna roll some grass , go and do that
you ain't trying to pass , don't do that
you gotta drink to mask , don't do that
finna act a ass , go and do that
say what now
get back down , get on up , get on up
this is what , truth feels like , so uncut
i'm in love on that cline , me rockin' moncler
white chick , long hair , but with a black man yeah
i shine like this , luminescent spit
get bright right quick
this as good as it get , two top floors of the motherfuckin' ritz
i only like hits , since p.e. see a nigga never miss
you see this black fist
a nigga come number one like the old limp biz
ain't no more to it
we out , remember me now ?
let's dance
yeah , yeah
i see you dance , all the dances you know what to do
i made this part for you and you and you and you and you and you , you , you , you !
bad boy
