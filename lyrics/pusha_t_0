20 plus years of selling johnson & johnson
i started out as a baby face monster
no wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
my teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
gem star razor and a dinner plate
arm & hammer and a mason jar , that's my dinner date
then crack the window in the kitchen , let it ventilate
cause i let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
nigga , i was crack in the school zone
two beepers on me , starter jacket that was two - toned
four lockers , four different bitches got their mule on
black ferris bueller , cutting school with his jewels on
couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
what i sell for pain in the hood , i'm a doctor
zhivago tried to fight the urge like ivan drago , if he dies he dies
like doughboy to tre , if he rides he rides
throwing punches in his room , if he cries he cries
we don't drink away the pain , when a nigga die
we add a link to the chain , inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
we playing on a higher game of chess
once you delegate his bills , who gon' fuck his bitch the best ?
a million megapixels of the pyrex
started on the scale digital , my only timex
nigga , this is timeless , simply cause it's honest
pure as the fumes that be fucking with my sinus
nigga this is simon says , simon red
blood on your diamonds till you dying â€“ dead , yuugh !
" you better change what comes out your speaker "
" dee - dee - dee , dah - dee , dah - dee , dee - dee , dah - dee , day - ah " ( what is it ? )
you wanna see a dead body ?
instrumentals from my momma's christmas party
troubles on my mind
i still smell crime , my little brother crying
smokers repeatedly buying my sega genesis , either that
or my auntie was stealing it , hit the pipe and start feeling it
oh wee , cut me some slack , weed never did that
this was different , geez , louise please help me relax
quantum physics could never show you the world i was in
when i was ten , back when nine ounces had got you ten
and nine times out of ten , niggas don't pay attention
and when there's tension in the air , nines come with extensions
my daddy turned a quarter piece to a four and a half
took a l , started selling soap fiends bubble bath
broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
shirt buttoned open , taco meat laying on his gold
i said " daddy , one day i'mma get you right with 36 zips
1000 grams of cocaine , then your name will be rich
now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
drop some ice cubes in it , deebo on perimeter "
he said " son , how come you think you be my connect ? "
i said " pops , your ass is washed up , with all due respect "
he said " well nigga , then show me how it all makes sense "
go figure , mothafucka , every verse is a brick , your son dope , nigga
now reap what you sowed , nigga ( please reap what you sowed , nigga )
i was born in '87 , my grand daddy a legend
now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession , let's get it
" you better change what comes out your speaker "
" they must be on the dick of who ? "
