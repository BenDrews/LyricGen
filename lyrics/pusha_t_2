come on , let's toast the champagne , this one's for the life
did everything you could to be here for the night
man it feels good , everything is right
energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
my whole team winning , no vision on quitting
i'd rather say i did than let them busters say i didn't
let 'em talk about it mane , i'm already living
i risk my life to try everyday to go and get it , get it , get it
came from the bottom , no one said it would be fair
now i'm on this money , lounging like it's a beach chair
poppa don't preach , all we do is just reach here
raised round killers , we just happy to be here
spot 'em , got 'em , let your soul pay your dues
while my hoes doing magic , voodoo moulin rouge
that's a tactic that they use , fuck 'em high then suck 'em dry
before you know it her q7 is buzzing by
the queen pin to the king pin redeems him
the boat comes , the dope drums , my team wins
yuugh ! this the life that we made
gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade
come on , let's toast the champagne , this one's for the life
did everything you could to be here for the night
man it feels good , everything is right

my whole team winning , no vision on quitting
i'd rather say i did than let them busters say i didn't
let 'em talk about it mane , i'm already living
i risk my life to try everyday to go and get it , get it , get it
supreme ballers , all my niggas got espys

gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade
