this is my time , this is my hour
this is my pain , this is my name , this is my power
if it's my reign , then it's my shower
this pole position , i made a lane cause they blocked ours
dope boys , block bleeders
gold diggers don't stop either
motivation is misguided
if you hit the mark , then it's not needed
carry on like a carry on , on my side bitch i let tag along
call me " daddy " from a complex
cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
no excuses , no regard
step on the brick like a promenade
twenty thousand on calling cards
and i'm speaking spanish like don omar
but i'm king push , this king push
i rap nigga 'bout trap niggas , i don't sing hooks
fuck nigga , with the sly talk
miss me , with all the pie talk
when them lights on you , and them letters there
you point us out , just like an eye - chart
but that's my fault , my details of the sidewalk
for eleven years , we seen better years
we was sellin' birds over the time port
my first grammy was my first brick
red carpet , every bad bitch
more bmf than billboard
i got a label deal under my mattress
cause i'm king push , this king push
i rap nigga 'bout trap niggas , i don't sing hooks , ah !
vultures to my culture
exploit the struggle , insult ya
they name dropping 'bout caine copping
but never been a foot soldier
let's have another look , just get a little closer
rage against the machine , black zack de la rocha
in a cranberry rossta , inside track on the g rap poster
best d - boy all i'm missing is a dash
difference between me and hova
but i'm king push , this king push
i rap nigga 'bout trap niggas , i don't sing hooks , ah !
