millions - millions in the ceiling
millions - millions in the ceiling
millions - millions in the ceiling
millions - millions in the ceiling
choppas - choppas in the closet

this shit cook up hard , don't it ?
y'all gotta beg my pardon on it
but this shit sound like god don't it ?
yuugh , i'm tired , nigga and y'all gotta pay your tithes , nigga
call my phantom the holy ghost , church on chrome wheel tires , nigga
pop tags when i'm paranoid , cause the pawn shop was my paradise
i was dead pop when that powder came for that knot saved in that shoebox
blue tops , blue tops , bad bitch in that blue fox
this big face is in blu - ray and these black diamonds like boondocks
i restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
hidin' choppas in the closet , half a million in the ceiling
and them hoes with angel faces , cryin' loud with ill intentions
just so i can buy them christians , have 'em shittin' on all they bitches , ah !
millions - millions in the ceiling
millions - millions in the ceiling
millions - millions in the ceiling
millions - millions in the ceiling
choppas - choppas in the closet
choppas - choppas in the closet
choppas - choppas in the closet
choppas - choppas in the closet
i'm haunted by horror stories , wanna - be home owners
horrible outcome , a dope boy got one motive
cries when he convicted , cried on every visit
i'm cryin' sayin' his name , ride for all my niggas
used to fiddle my finger 'til i found me a fortune
finger fuck a ferrari , south of france early morning
did drugs with donatella , versace my a cappella
never see me in neiman's , niggas committin' treason
soft loafer preferred , frost , organic herb
stay away from the forbes , if i only could tell you more
i got this i got that , i got that i got this
got a kilo for 20 , my choppas say i'm the shit
millions - millions in the ceiling
millions - millions in the ceiling
millions - millions in the ceiling
millions - millions in the ceiling
choppas - choppas in the closet
choppas - choppas in the closet
choppas - choppas in the closet
choppas - choppas in the closet
this that shit y'all ask for
make a nigga mash on the gas , floor
two - door , four - door , roll through the hood like task force
fast forwardâ€“oops ! they say they wanna see proof
my record sales ain't much as theirs and we still ride the same coupes
how we still fuck the same hoes , why we still buy the same clothes
how we both got the same watch , i'm just keepin' y'all on y'all toes
dope boys , gold mine , that price drop and that coke rise
then set it over that blue flame then hang it dry like clothesline
i restore the feelin' of when niggas made a killin'
hidin' choppas in the closet , half a million in the ceiling
got the razor on the counter , arm & hammer in the kitchen
just to keep my feet in christians and keep fuckin' all y'all bitches
millions - millions in the ceiling
millions - millions in the ceiling
millions - millions in the ceiling
millions - millions in the ceiling
choppas - choppas in the closet
choppas - choppas in the closet
