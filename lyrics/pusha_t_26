yeah... i just ordered one my nigga
yeah...
i’m still a snow mover , blow harder than tuba
designated shooters , turn weed to woolers
condo in atlanta , money counters like the nasdaq
in that glass back , the motor is the ass crack
i’m still feeding divas like i feed the meter
holy father to em , i ain’t talking jesus neither
balance on the scale , i ain’t a libra either
i’m just a name and a number with the means to reach ya
grim reaper , him cheaper , hemp chiefer
his army , mcm on gym sneakers
you knowin that hymn better , he been preaching
you motherfuckers is bloodsuckers you been leeching
been baller , been jacob , been dealer
been realer , pound sign , been trilla
all killer , no filler , been iller
fraud niggas you zoolander , ben stiller
when it comes to shooters my niggas is trained to go
and they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
35 hundred , just point and give them a name
they back flipping niggas , that go for rappers the same
you don't know me nigga , fuck out my way
between renter and a homeowner
hip hop weekly cover and a rolling stoner
lufthansa i heist nigga , or that bitch winona
stop comparing me to rappers cause they in their moment
might of crossed the name brand every blue
but these brand names to a brand owner isn't new
don't make us equal cause we shared a bitch or two
she ain't the angel that you think , she reincarnated too
i build mine off fed time and dope lines
you caught steam off headlines and co - signs
young niggas cliquing up with my rivals
like the bible don't burn like these bullets don't spiral
like i can't see the scene that you mirror in your idol
but a pawn’s only purpose is completely suicidal
oh , suicide , it's a suicide
i'm just talking to the world like it's you and i
nothing but cash here , this sweater is cashmere
the roof is a translucent , it's nothing but glass there
the car is a concept , what's next is my last year
my future is bright hot , you never can last here
i'm top 5 , listen , who hot in the past year ?
five heartbeats and i'm feeling like flash here
cause what i captured is the beast unleashed in the pasture
story of the sheep and the wolves i un - master
fifty in the liquor , unwrapped 'em
unpacked , powder rise and it fall like sebastian
telfair , tailor - made suits hand crafted
over bottega veneta , high tops unfastened
s550 drop top is unimaginable
to my hand drop and then he unattached it
practice it , nigga brick , break down , break dance
crab walk , back spin , tanner than my black skin
