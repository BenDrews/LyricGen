boy , you got that 6 in the morning
you got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
oh i say boy , you got me lonely
just say the words , i'll do anything you want
boy , let me love you
uh , i know that you think i'm the one , but who doesn't ?
it comes with the territory when you buzzin'
a ball player sold you a dream , ain't do nothing
a couple rappers under your belt , but who's judging ?
i ain't trying to guide you , hand on bible
but instagram pics show more than side views
30 dollar nude catsuits is not cute
and 50 comments on ass is not fluke
so , no cuffing , no buns in the oven
if my girl call your phone she's just bluffin'
as long as you and i both know we just fuckin'
if anybody else do ask , we just nothing
hey mama come fuck with the shotta
with the givenchy toppa , shoe balenciaga
if you act right , i can match you up proper
if it's about a dolla' thing , big like poppa
introduce your exes to my choppa
don't listen to your best friend , she don't matter
you know she wanna be you in that vehicle
riding in see - through v1 v2
chanel or celine , however i see you
christians or chloe , damn them c's too
you know i play fair , i'm daddy day care
i know it ain't cheap for you to lay here
let's get past the nonsense and be honest
all the ones i sponsored clear my conscience
can't commit the crime without accomplice
we both to blame , let's push the shame behind us
on the dl , pushin' my brother’s cl
meet you at the spot , you had tint on the tl
it’s only right you shake them phony types
and embrace the kid , like my bracelets did
uh , i’m from the era where the money come fast
blow it all cause the money don’t last
all them broke niggas lookin' puppy - dog sad
she in that new purse , sayin' “honey don’t ask”
