i'm so bossy , bitch , get off me
it's a different jingle when you hear these car keys
your sl's missing an s , nigga
your plane's missing a chef
the common theme , see they both got wings
if you fly , do it to death
it's only one god , and it's only one crown
so it's only one king that can stand on this mound
king push , kingpin , overlord
coast guard come a hundred going overboard
i got money with the best of 'em
go blow for blow with any mexican
don't let your side bitches settle in
might have to headbutt your evelyn
ballers , i put numbers on the boards
hard to get a handle on this double - edged sword
whether rapping or i'm rapping to a whore
might reach back and relapse to wrapping up this raw
givenchy fitting like it's gym clothes
we really gymstars , i'm like d. rose
no d - league , i'm like this close
'88 jordan , leaping from the free throw
ballers , i put numbers on the boards
ballers , i put numbers on the boards
( mothafuckas can't rhyme no more , 'bout crime no more )
mix drug and show money , biggs burke on tour
25 bricks , move work like chore
hit delaware twice , needed 25 more
i see flaw , cracks in your diamond
cb4 when you rhyme , simple simon
come and meet the pieman , a must that i flaunt it
the legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us
ballers , i put numbers on the boards
can't a bitch living say i bought her michael kors
every car driven was decided by the horse
keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder what it cost
how could you relate when you ain't never been great ?
and rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates , nigga ?
i might sell a brick on my birthday
36 years of doing dirt like it's earth day , god
ballers , i put numbers on the boards
