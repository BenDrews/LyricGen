yeah , i'm on the move , i can - can't look back ( no way )
screaming " no regrets , no regrets at all "
wasting time , i can't get that back
uh , so everyday i go hard
real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
came from making real figures ( too much money )
nothing less , no regrets ( let's get it )
no - no , no regrets , ahhh...
say hi to the bad guy , say ahhh to the champagne
got a call from my jail niggas , said i'm doing my damn thing
( woo ! ) they see i'm doing my damn thing
magazines , videos , they ain't missing a damn thing
nowadays i sell hope , what you rather i sell dope ?
what i sell is a lifestyle , naked bitches on sailboats
foreign cars on a freight train for every nigga they railroad
rent - a - cars we road run , money longer than train smoke
i done been in that same boat , i ain't letting this chain go
representing my niggas down till they free 'em like django
it's the same old , just the same old
how the game go , where the pain go , where the blame go
my mind wanders on a pj , my momma brought up in the pjs
in the club sippin' p&j on the same arm as my piaget ( woo ! )
if i leave today , throw the keys away
but i'mma live today , i wanna see tomorrow , i wanna lead the way
momma had me in the ghetto , i was raised in the slums
every hero got theme music , guess i need me some drums
bought me a 5 for 50 , i bust 'em down , it was jumps
trying to be fresh as forces , i swear they white as new ones
streets taught us , streets raised us , had it less determined
dodging jackers , dodging murders , federal to state pen
uncle got power , now i see him in another 10
we was set up just to lose , lord know we trying to win
in the pursuit of this power , this masterpiece to the hour
you know it's platinum and waterproof , wear this bitch in the shower
yeah , we want finer things , plus a plug in the scale
yeah , them plates shining like diamond rings at back can't you tell ?
in the hood i'm a king , king arthur to the people
except he got his on a chariot , i got mine in a regal
sportcars , italian leather , princess cut , with baguettes
law of physics say them 9s weigh more when they wet
no regrets
presidential i came back , april showers i rains back
jumped ahead like june something , still i'm wheeling that maybach
time forward , my braids back , tom ford and my shades black
dope boy with a cape on , super - sizing that beige back
all white like gotti said , ye told me i'm outta here
mentioned ye two years ago , yeah , i got that by the square
( woo ! ) and you could buy a pair , 20 or more and we'll fly 'em there
how you acting like i'm ain't here ? d - boy and i pioneer
