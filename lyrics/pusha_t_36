espera , ven aquí , who you wanna be ? drug dealer ? demon ? rap nigga ? you tryna save the culture ? ay dios mío. you gotta pick one , daddy
leave your conscience at the door
we done hid the monsters in the floor
i speak to the trap lords
and niggas wit their hands in the white like blackboards
i done been black balled
and never gave a fuck ‘cause i’m jack frost
of sellin’ that blast off
i’m on a crash course
where talent meets timing
christopher wallace , think big , keep climbing
reasonable doubt , drug era , keep climbing
i’m my brother’s keeper , lord willin’ , keep grindin’
as a god amongst men
rinsed drug money , i done paid for my sins
books and the lawyers , i done paid for my friends
still held back , i done paid with my skin
the only thing missing is a cape on me
you niggas wanna tag a late , great on me
put the fears in my peers , heard my footsteps coming from the rear
now it’s murder was the case homie
i’m watching this three ring circus
old lions don’t roar , so the clowns ain’t nervous
even you fools serve purpose
let ‘em run amuck until the king resurface
then it’s off with your heads
wear your little jewels , you could floss when you’re dead
they take samples of ‘em , i make examples of ‘em
it’s the thrill of the hunt , i keep my mantle covered
ask ‘ye who’s loyalty more realer
ask p , who’s core’s a drug dealer
me and tim , it's coming , it’s gonna kill ‘em
the only great i ain’t made better was j. dilla
now we breaking new ground
get ready for the placing of the crown
king push nigga !
