in the midst of negativity
a positive sight can be blurred
and the visions that we thought were good
seems to let evil occur
while still possessing our human form
we live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
and as we bow our heads at night , rich , wealthy
or poor with dislike , we pray , asking for
forgiveness for our sinful ways
with mind , body , spirit and faith , we pray
amen
yeah ( amen ) you like that right ? ( amen )
i wrote it myself by the way ( amen )
yo young , jeezy , jizzle , snowman ( amen , amen )
we gotta give the streets what they want , man ( amen )
fuck the goddamn shit ( amen )

and i don’t mean to be selfish
but i picture myself getting paid
and you might catch pneumonia
cause i'm colder than a elf on a sleigh
me and pusha back on it
