i don't never feel pain , cause i done felt too much pain
money goin' in the rain , blood flowing through my veins
i'm just doing my thing , get money , babygirl , gold chains
i don't never feel pain , cause i done felt too much pain
standing in the rain , blood flowing through my veins
i ain't never did a thing , getting money , rocking chains
we'll never feel the same , we the thugs in the game
i don't never feel pain
18 wheeler gorillas
black with gold chains , pitch bird like steelers
hines ward of the crime lords
running through this money screaming " encore "
spending nights with the prime whore
but that's the bitch that you're blind for
celebrating on a whim , nigga
pain is pac above the rim , nigga
my bitch rock a bigger gem , niggas
cause she was there when it was dim , nigga
she wasn't fucking none of them niggas
so now we're even like a hem , nigga
put your freedom over failure
tryna find my griselda ( la madrina ! )
might as well , they gon' nail ya
momma screaming like mahalia
pain is love and it's war
pain is running out of raw
pain is finding out you're poor
as the feds knock at your door
i dont never feel pain , cause i done felt too much pain
been around here , standing in the rain , blood flowing through my veins
i'm just doing my thing , getting money , rocking tons of gold chains
i dont never feel pain , cause i done felt too much pain
i'm just standing in the rain , blood flowing through my veins
i'm just doing my thing , getting money , rock a hundred gold chains
million dollars on one gold ring
pain is joy when it cries
it's my smile in disguise
it's what makes the story chilling
spare the women and the children
hear the scribbles of the villain ( yugh ! )
this is drug dealer brilliance
pyrex on the platter like hot sex
but my tribe don't quest like love
pain in this bitch , with a mask and a glove
and a team of lawyers to run the train on the judge
it's no risk without gain
it's no trust without shame
it's no us without 'cain
push , my name is my name
in the kitchen with a cape on , apron
tre - eight on , coulda been trayvon
but instead i chose avon
powder face like a geisha
arm & hammer for the breakup
turn one into two , watch the brick kiss and makeup ( woo ! )
it's a match made in heaven
all that's missing is the reverend
all that's missing is a blessing
i hope god gets the message
i dont never feel pain , cause i done felt too much pain
been around here , standing in the rain , blood flowing through my veins
i'm just doing my thing , getting money , rocking tons of gold chains
i dont never feel pain , cause i done felt too much pain
i'm just standing in the rain , blood flowing through my veins
i'm just doing my thing , getting money , rock a hundred gold chains
million dollars on one gold ring
