*kanye west harmonizes for 25 seconds*
i sold more dope than i sold records
you niggas sold records , never sold dope
so i ain’t hearing none of that street shit
cause in my mind , you mothafuckas sold soap
got rich selling hope to the hopeless
but i’m a thinker , methodic in my motives
i motivate to put my niggas into motors
no woman , no child , no witness , no jehovahs
like scarface but it's god's face in that mirror
we was made in his image , dialing and it's much clearer
scoring from the heights but i wanted mine purer
aryan , blonde hair , blue - eyed like the führer
the judge and the jury , the jewellery mad froze
water colors on my neck , fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
we ain't the same color clarity of diamond , nigga
nah , i ain't got nothing in common with yous
pain in my heart , it's as black as my skin
they tipping the scale for these crackers to win
no reading , no writing , made us savage of men
they praying for jail but i mastered the pen
descended from kings , we at it again
just hand me the crown , i'm active again
everything that it seems , hear my passion again
was never my dream , the immaculate win
i was pissing my shorts having rich nigga thoughts
wish i had a pistol before all the friends i done fought
over night i seen a nigga go get a carrera
two weeks later i had to be that boy pallbearer
young king bury me inside a glass casket
windex wipe me down for the life after
crack dealer living like a hoop star
black marble , white walls in my new spot
four chains , big studs , a nigga too fly
top down , tank top , i think i'm 2pac
so i'm labeled the rebel , nigga get on my level
we were born to be kings , only major league teams
chasing my paper , couldn't fathom my wealth
built a school in ethiopia , should enroll in myself
god body and mind , food for the soul
when you feeding on hate , you empty , my nigga , it shows
follow the codes , ain’t no love for these hoes
if you slip and you fall i got you my nigga , hold on
if you right or you wrong , if you riding come on
by the end of this song , can't be hiding for long
i seen children get slaughtered , niggas' grandmothers assaulted
throw a gang sign , dare you do something about it
fuck copping them foams , when you copping the home
cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home
follow the codes , ain't no love for these hoes
if you slipping you fall , i got you my nigga hold on
if you right or you wrong , if you riding come on
by the end of this song , i got you my nigga hold on
i got you my nigga hold on
i got you my nigga hold on
if you right or you wrong , if you riding come on
by the end of this song , i got you my nigga hold on
i got you my nigga hold on
i got you my nigga hold on
i got you my nigga hold on
i got you my nigga hold on
