my mind is telling me no
but my body , my body's telling me yes
i ( baby ) don't want to hurt nobody
but there is something that i must confess ( chill )
i don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
i don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
i don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
i don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind

and i know just what you need girl
so baby bring your body to me ( bring your body here )
i'm not fooling around with you baby

someone like me
to satisfy your every need
i don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
