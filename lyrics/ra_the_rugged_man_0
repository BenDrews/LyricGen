yo , let's begin it like this
the definition of a rap flow , i'mma reinvent it like this
now what's that ? bust first , i bust back
must crush , bust gats , must bust , a small time crook
i'm stealing your hubcaps , ain't nothing for discussion
i'm crushing you're dust and you're done in when i'm busting the rough raps
the biz mark , biz mark
what is it ? a blizzard - is it a limit ?
any crime you could name i commited
i admit it , i did it
lottery , gotta be in it to win it
i'm just a white boy ruining what blacks invented
but i'm the baddest , undefeated
beat it , believe it , leaving you leaking , losing blood like an anemic
i'm rather conceited
rappers are comedic , heated leaving you paraplegic
i'm undeniable , diabolical , biological warfare
rugged that raggedy bastard
his breath stink like he gargling with battery acid
who would've figured me to be deadly ?
they never be ready to bury me
better be ready , nobody better than me , sing !
i'm feeling so groovy now
rugged man's flow will fuck your whole head up
i'm feeling so groovy now
{let's begin it like this

rugged man's flow is uglier than blind dates
my mental is heavy like heavy d & chubb rock combined weights
i love myself , i'm so vain
i'm not just the king of new york , i'm the king of the whole game
putting rappers in hibernation , they're hiding away
for retirement they're racing , it's funny , like a pie in the face
and devastating , made a mistake
and you're waiting , debating , facing your fate
and creating , hating , raping , imitating , the great
and break in your place and taking your safe and taking your paper
paying for faking , this is history in the making , but wait
spit at the cops , i'm resisting arrest
they wanna see me fry like a chicken wing and a breast
the truth is , behind closed doors i’m a bit of a sissy
singing love ballads to bitches like lionel richie
no joking , bragging and boasting hoping to get close and approach 'em
poke 'em , perking , and posing , potent poison the potion
cooking the coke and cutting your throat , any opponent opposing
leave you float in the ocean
you was aaliyah rocking the boat and
leaving ya broken , get smokey to second that emotion
explosion of flowing , overdosing , the chosen has spoken , sing !
i'm feeling so groovy now
rugged man's flow will fuck your whole head up
i'm feeling so groovy now
{let's begin it like this

rat - tat - tat sporadic , attack panic
laying you down like craftmatic
you dissing missing your fingertips
you crack addict , i've had it
i'm back at it , the mathematic
bringing the black magic attack
hold up , let's slow it down with these raps
let me catch my breath , let my brain relax
i'm so fly , i'm basically levitating
i'm in the guinness book , record breaking
hit you with a chair like the world wrestling federation
i got a bad reputation
doc want to put me on a better medication
cops hate me , harass me , interrogation
i’m dumb in the head , lack of education
that's enough , wait a minute
i'm finished , i'm done with it
yo swan , sing it
i'm feeling so groovy now
rugged man's flow will fuck your whole head up
i'm feeling so groovy now
{let's begin it like this
the definition of a rap flow , i'ma reinvent it like this}
i'm feeling so groovy now
rugged man's flow will fuck your whole head up
