yeah , you rappers bore me , i wanna kill you
do it for me and i'll holla - holla
i am the pinnacle of sin , it shows when he begin his flows
timid women show genitals , then it's " go " when it's presentable
finna show women some in this moment diminish whores
skin it , no gimmicks , replenish , no - grim no limit shows
call it what you want it - middle finger my opponent
really seem defiant , don't it
one moment
i will demolish niggas with the rawest scriptures
y'all is just balls of shit in a stall , let's hit , this be the hardest pisser
then a tramp will tell me , my piss enhance her belly
but i chose to give her a dirty mouth like lisa lampanelli
yes , she demanded jelly , but i re - ran the kelly
i'm springing the yelly and it's swell because i slammed the belvy
i'm a monster , on the mic or when i'm on her
have a motherfucker somber , cause of ill shit that i conjure
juggernaut , he never conquered , if she wants for me , i haunt her
wondering where we've gone , sir r.a. and tech , yeah we bonkers

yo , it's a brutal system , assume position
you superstition ? or jew or christian ?
school religion is a cruel depiction
they can blind your hearing , they can mute your vision
live in the dirt , burn , slithering earth worm
leave you like mj with a hit and a burnt perm
soon to be unity , murder me , what could you do to me ?
this is foolery , i'm a hooligan , leaving you drooling
when i'm beating you brutally
slappin' your bitch and takin' your jewelry
your mama crying when she reading your eulogy
let me slow down , put your dough down
i've got enough flow for it to go 'round
this is profound , you a broke clown
with a coke frown and an old sound
i'm like " sell 'em the heroin and givin' 'em the needle "
i'm in your cerebral , this wigger is evil
limit the people , piss in a cathedral
aborting your mission like a position that's fetal
my impolite stares give 'em nightmares
burn 'em like the bush , give 'em white hairs
jiving and shucking your ass , sufferin' succotash
i fuck with the gutter trash , don't fuck with the upper class
sellers and buyers , political liars
the drug suppliers , the fake messiahs
is it negative energy hiding their identity ?
every enemy wishing they were shooting me like a kennedy
i spit at satan and i kick his face in
make him lick the pavement for misbehaving
you got a vendetta ? better be ready to forget it
bullets is headed to your head and embedded , the slug met it
i be tripping on my ego like i'm ultra magnetic
makin' dollars like i'm parrish and erick
i'm back , check it bitch
