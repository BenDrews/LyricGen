i can see your halo
yo , my heart feel like it's suffering from strangulation
tears flying outta my eyes , my heart racing and my hands shaking
the last days of your life as a cancer patient
i'm staring at your corpse praying and waiting for you to awaken
21 - gun salute for the hero , the burial was beautiful
both green berets and screaming eagles attended the funeral
i was mad at god like he murdered you
as a father you couldn't have done a better job
all six of your children basically worshipped you
if i needed advice i always came to you to discuss it
you was the only person since the day i was born i ever trusted
through poverty , death , disease and sickness
you always somehow found a way to turn the situation optimistic
i was a big fat kid overweight
so to clown me you bought me the fat boys , it was my very first rap tape
in the neighborhood you had a name , you was feared and respected
other fathers walked out on their kids and left them neglected
my only regret about not selling out and getting richer
is that if i made millions i could've shared it and spent it with you
i miss you , i love you daddy
yo , part good samaritan , part criminal , a master with weapons
nice with his hands , he was rugged man the original
as children we saw you losing your sanity
even though we watched you struggle financially
you kept the love in the family
daddy , i'm thinking about you every day though
i can see you holding a machine gun in heaven with angel wings and a halo
you was always quick to pick a pocket
you're the only one in heaven
probably slick enough to pull off stealing god's wallet
in life the lord ain't really deal you a fair one
i watched you bury your baby boy , your daughter and your grandson
you lived one hell of a life from being highly decorated
to being homeless sleeping in the park with your pregnant wife
if i acted up in the restaurant i knew i was being brave
cause you'd take me to the bathroom and spank me 'til i knew how to behave
taught me prayers at night and you'd tell me bible stories
taught me history , crazy horse and his tribal glories
how many times as a kid i seen you handcuffed by the cops ?
you taught us black music , sam cooke , the drifters , the four tops
taught me about boxing , ray leonard and larry holmes
around the same time you left my mother for debbie jones
i told the world your true story and after the record got made
uncommon valor , some said i dropped the verse of the decade
everywhere you went you would tell the world about your son rugged man
you was so proud of me , daddy , you was my number one fan
you was always bragging about me to no purpose
on your deathbed you'd play my mayweather interview for the nurses
losing you , daddy , it hurt more than any physical pain
you was too young when the cancer went from your throat and into your brain
you was my teacher , my idol , i worshipped you , you was the best , daddy
you lived a tough life , now get some rest , daddy
i love you daddy
