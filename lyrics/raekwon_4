( i told you a long time ago you fucking little monkey not to fuck me
( hey hey , who the fuck you think you talking to huh ? ? ! )
( who the fuck you think i am your fucking bellboy ? )
( you wanna go to war ? .... wanna go to war , ok ? )
coming up on half a mil , we build
get real y'all , taking you on another one son
uhh , julio iglesias
making cream like that nigga
yo , first of all son , peep the arson
many brothers i be sparking and busting mad light inside the dark
call me dough snatcher , just the brother for the rapture
i hang glide , holding on strong , hard to capture
extravagant , rza bake the track and it's militant
then i react , like a convict , and start killing shit
it's manifested , the gods work like appliances
dealing in my cypher i revolve around sciences
the 9th chamber , leave you trapped inside my hallway
you try to flee but you got smoked up by the doorway
no question , i send your ass back , right to the essence
your whole frame is smothered in dirt , now how you resting
while i'll be trapped by sounds , locked behind loops
throwing niggas off airplanes cause cash rules
everything around me , black , as you can see
swallow this murder one verse like god degree
then analyze my soundtrack for satisfaction
you adapt like a flashback chain reaction
( lace them niggas , son )
ak's black bust back like seventy macs
i'm all that , street niggas knowing my steez black
ron g , you know he coincide with me , see ,
marvelous menace for society
but anyway , let's toast , champagne thoughts with ghost
i max the most shotguns through the nose
fuck rap , hip hop put me on top
'lo wears , and tommy hil fly shit with a knot
the witty unpredictable live shit , drive by shit
do or die shit , i'll take your lye and shit
and then you know , i'm running through the penal , foul
four - toothed child was wild
the old lady snitched , but fuck it , you know it , one love kid
no i'm not doing a bid
too much to get for what cause six niggas got stuck
and the nigga chain was truck
yo fuck that , criminology rap
sneakers stay jet black floating in the flyest ac'
nigga... bring it ! yeah
much love go to new york city
all my tommy hil' ice rocking niggas
