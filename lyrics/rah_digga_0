y'all must be out y'all muthafuckin' minds
it's the nigga in me ( x4 )
you must've bumped yo muthafuckin' head
it's the nigga in me ( x4 )
they gon' read it and weep
they wanna wake a sleepin' giant that ain't even asleep
playin' w/ my 70s , and my ps3
i kept hearin' my name , i said let me see
" the bitch might be a nigga , for reala , she rah digga "
what the fuck man ?
this guy , you barely caught a meal short of fish fry
think i'm lettin' this fly , fat trel can kiss my
global rap ass , he barely out of d.c
tried to look him up , he ain't even got a wiki
on his records gettin' cheeky , tryna throw some shee shee
i'm right at the door , like when a dog's gotta pee pee
some say it's beneath me , i should be the bigger artist
but this what happens when you get a nigga get started
the veterans , i love the referange
i love to talk slick , i love to reprimand
dudes sayin' my name , i come like candy man
made nightmare on e street , more like candy land
have them rhymes you be spittin' , sound like rhythm and blues
mel gibson , what he did to them jews
this waka flocka mixed with choppa , done forgot what rah digga could do
such a lady and i'm still more nigga than you
" you remind me of rah digga
a bitch rappin' like a nigga
or was it a nigga rappin' like a bitch ? ! "
y'all invoked that spirit , and them raw ass lyrics
from the only female too raw to compare it
to most of these rap dudes that claim they so street
i don't think i'm that rough , i think niggas too sweet
soccer mom harder than y'all , man that's pitiful
now i understand why rap is so ridiculed
went up on twitter , and i found these jokers
sits em on my next chapter , sit em down like oprah
i'm like yo gabba gabba , this no laughin' matter
this grown woman swagger , to you monkey rap bastards
keep it in your own bracket , don't get too erratic
this hunger games shit , i use you for practice
fuck is you creatin' , son , a whole generation
of some , hey horton , skateboardin' , worshippin' satan asses
bingin' on drugs , somebody get me the gloves
i don't think they need deals man , i think they need hugs
and i was trying to support this young black man
it's too bad you probably lost your only black fan
from now on , keep anointing ointment and ? ? ?
take it any further , and you might catch a backhand
bitch
see , you don't have to like me
you don't gotta listen to my shit
but you will respect me
bitch !
