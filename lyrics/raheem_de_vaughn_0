love king forever
my heart has chosen
and that's all i know
i never meant to confuse you
i never meant to complicate your life ( complicate your life )
for loving matters of the heart
being stuck in a triangle of emotion

and another thing to love somebody

love him like i love ya
i love you like i never loved nobody
and all i know
my heart has chosen
my heart is choosing you
my heart is choosing , that's all i know
my heart has chosen
my heart is choosing
my heart is choosing you
my heart is choosing
that's all i know
that night we laid down as friends
we graduated to lovers
you changed my heart and ways forever
now we're stuck in this triangle of emotion ( caught up )
it was one thing to want somebody ( versus )
another thing to need somebody ( versus )
and another thing to love somebody
and all i know

oh no , no no
and all i know is baby
