i'm nothing without you , mi amore
like a heaven for an angel
like a smile for happiness
like love making switching angles
like church on sunday morning , feeling blessed
like joy and jubilee
like an eagle soaring high in the sky
like a ruler of a throne
like a key unlocks a home
what's a man without his woman ? nothing
what's a sky without its blue ? nothing
i'm nothing without you
( nothing , nothing , nothing , nothing )
i'm nothing without you
( without you , without you )
just nothing without you
( nothing , nothing , nothing , nothing )
nothing without you
( without you , without you )
nothing
like a morning without the sun
like a home without the run
galaxies without the stars
jupiter , earth and mars
like cupid without a bow , without an arrow , without a name
like a groom standing on an alter without a bride to take his name
like a yacht with no water to sail
like a wish with no wishing well
what's a ruler without its throne
with no queen to call it home
baby there ain't no way that i could even do one day
without you , i mean nothing without you
baby there ain't no face that ever could replace your space
without you , without you
baby i'd be , i'd be hollow inside
i'd be a lonely knight
i'd be a lonely king of the throne
( just nothing without you )
i'd be an empty house that's crawling home
a beating heart with no love inside
i'd be nothing , nothing , nothing , nothing , nothing , nothing
nothing , without you
without you
without you , without you , without you
i'd be...
( nothing , nothing , nothing )
