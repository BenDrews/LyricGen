we were best friends
at least that's what i thought
then you had to go and rip out my fucking heart
i admit i fell in love
from the very start
i never imagined a moment where we would be apart
i know what you're thinking
" damn you really bugging "
but i supported you when the world said you was nothing
there in the beginning to this unhappy ending
i figured it was i time i can finally stop pretending
you did the unthinkable
it's no turning back
and that's exactly where you left the blade at
this is not a disagreement
it's more lack of trust
i should have had in you
that you had in us
so here we both probably thinking about the past
" could i have done more to help this thing that we had "
maybe
that's just silly me being crazy
i'm never gonna fuck with you again
it's over
i said they don't love you they know how to pretend
and these are the people who call themselves friends
i can't front
it's funny how life do
cause in the beginning i said things just spite you
took a few shots out but now i really like who you choose to become
when most people run
they had you boxed in
and i ain't going to sit here and pretend to even know what the talk did to you
scars on the ego
tend to be wounds that never heal and if they do slow
whats your motivation
what keeps you coming back
how you keep pushing when niggas turn they backs
i'm getting pissed for you but you looking so relaxed
if it's chinks in your armor you refuse to show cracks
many claim to have the medicine
but most of them are quacks
i ain't one to judge but most them niggas wack
what you think about them
i wish nothing but the best
keep doing you
motherfuck the rest
