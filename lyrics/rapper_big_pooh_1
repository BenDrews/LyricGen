see , you'll always be a part of me
i'll be good for you , wait and see...
my mama told me thomas you should keep fighting
the words that i heard is you should keep writing
blank stare out the window , watching a plastic bag go exactly as the wind blow
steady is the tempo , these people think it's simple waking up every morning trying to figure out where time go
my thoughts ain't clear , how am i wind up here ?
now i'm drinking a beer , it's 10 o'clock in the a.m. me and my body swaying to the mayhem
people like it ain't him , staring at me like they looking at an evil twin
half grin the only thing that i could muster , knowing at that exact moment my life was really flustered
my house flooded , career studded , me and my baby got our backs to the wall like it ain't nothing
actually i'm breaking down though , my life's soundtrack the beautiful sounds of a piano
played by a two year old , banging on the keys
every night i'm on my knees asking god mercy please help me out
i know he hear my please without a doubt ( ha )
now it's time for me to get out , keep pushing
no cushion , hungrier than ever , i'm willing to grind forever
fuck whether i'm the postman
the end of the night propose a toast fam
trying to fake it til you make it , you dont understand
i was never happy , but if you're here with me then we could sing a song
how ill would that be ? if we could celebrate forever til we're gone
with ( ? ) around me , is everything i need so let the candles go
( uh huh ) happy birthday ya'll , happy birthday ya'll
parked the car i burned out out of second gear
every year , i'm talking bout it's my year
on that 12th now , working on the 5th year
trying to navigate the world , but its rocky here
no adrians , no apollo creeds
i flipping soil for my future seeds
i'm tired of flipping soil and i don't own the deeds
if a snakes in your yard better cut the weeds
preoccupied with want ; s , can't afford your needs
and the teacher told me i wouldn't succeed ( haha )
can you hear me now ? margie's middle child making mama really proud
you can finally smile , tomorrow means a brighter day
happy birthday ya'll , wipe your tears away
happy birthday ya'll , happy birthday - birthday , yeah ( 3x )
