beat box , this is back to the block
before every rapper sold rocks
before everybody needed rocks in they watch
just watch , now , it's all about boardrooms and stocks
words paint pictures , i'm an artist non - stop
raw beats , raps , this is called hip - hop
only way i flop is belly first in a pool
people talk brand talk to a appear cool
learn to follow rules , i'm a man first , fool
get schooled , chalk it all up to business , being shrewd
no guidelines , you're an outline , food
sharks in the water , this is what you wanna do
for me , this is like breathing , blood in the veins
muscle on the bone , we are not the same
i rap to make change , you rapping for the change
scraps and cadillacs , go ahead and do your thang
over the global , my vocals be travelling
i'm the flavor
words of wis - wisdom
i'm the flavor
words of wis - wisdom
i rap like no one out there can fuck with me
i'm the flavor
over the global , my - my - my my vocals be travelling
i'm the flavor
words of wis - wisdom
i rap like no one out there can fuck with me
gossip sites is where you go to get your raps from
forbes magazine aspire to be number 1
but no rapper gonna make it to that top layer
you a nigga now and was before you got here
spare the hard feelings , this is dope dealing
enough rope for you to choke yourself , easy killing
call it hands free , youngin' , ask for me
i'm on the balcony , hands gripping the pump
see how being drunk off the ego will skew the mind , limited view
a theater near you displays every dream until it seems that it's true
cointelpro , they infiltrated the crew
then throw us in a jail operated like a zoo
i'm just reminding you of things you already knew
from that project concrete , a rose grew
but we only see the weeds in our view
