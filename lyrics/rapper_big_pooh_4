i hail from freedom hill , on my feet , i stand
and what used to be fila's and reebok's , damn
i would meet you at the weed spot where we got grams
enough , doc couldn't detox , so need i plan
to squeeze off , man , if we not fam
and let them die for ever trying to calcify my penile gland
yeah , they rap like fajitas but chica's fan of whose
getting more play like the east side band , ya heard
she likes diction , a lot of words
non - fiction , a bad boy pissed and who fly the bird
if he's a christian , what is this , he got the earth
93 million miles away , glock in her purse
ahk' got the nerve , yeah , i know i ought to serve
everybody looking for a fix , if i got the work
this is not a curse , chip on my collared shirt
bless manifest my destiny , yep , without the church
amen , whose son is making a living
done chasing the chicken but stashed cake in the kitchen
some hated we kick it , these bums basically sickened
not a part of my body , god , too big for tripping , huh
my alibi , tell them i was high when you seen me
resurrect malcolm x , raise my kundalini
genocide couldn't pry me out the black beanie
still tapped the bottle of moscato , watch the genie
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah
praise the gun you gon' have to praise the shooter
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah
praise the gun you gon' have to praise the shooter
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah
praise the gun you gon' have to praise the shooter
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah
praise the gun you gon' have to praise the shooter
while youtube got niggas fooled
fuck the neh - neh , i'm just trying to get us all free like cinque
whole lot of followers , a lot less leading
when y'all niggas gonna realize you can't hashtag freedom
hashtag free my nigga when you know he did it
make us look ignorant , don't air his business
as a culture , now we back where we started , all over
while niggas in the club predict rain like al roker
i'm just trying to get us on track like locomotives
touch your soul , like what's the motive
i just hope you remain focused on what the goal is
god body , young marcus garvey , my mama said
hood's prophet , i'm hood's topic
2 years later , i still got it , fuck the street cred
in the '86 cutlass bumping jeezy
holler at your boy if you ever need me
cause i'm gone , maybe off the liquor
or maybe in the '86 caprice with a lift kit
either way it goes , i'm lifted
while niggas iced out to the t like they lipton
dumbing down their lyrics just to get some recognition
i'll be in the booth like craig mack kicking flavor in your system
uh , or better yet , your eardrum
fuck the metaphors , hope the truth make you listen
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah
praise the gun you gon' have to praise the shooter x4
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah
praise the gun you gon' have to praise the shooter x4
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah
praise the gun you gon' have to praise the shooter x4
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah
praise the gun you gon' have to praise the shooter x4
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah
praise the gun , you gon' have to praise the shooter
so hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah
praise the gun , you gon' have to praise the shooter
if it's to be its up to me , i think i figure that
most y'all started rapping cause you thought that's where the figures at
try to change the game like three 6 before the oscars
knowing i'm popping and keep it going , no show - stopping
i'm more like vlade in la , you know , without the flopping
vintage game but it's all the same , still point dropping
interview with ahmad then hit up lauryn , get it popping
it's crazy , she used to stop in and never stay and leave you talking
topics i'm okay with sharing now
before they didn't think about it , guess who's caring now
because their favorite rapper been slacking , i'll go and then put a track in
demolish y'all polished flows that was keeping their fans attracted
i did , don't speak on it , karma keep me repenting
made mistakes and now my plate look like a big pile of spinach
too strong , had to move on , the city say i'm due on
been at it for some years , we eating free without a coupon
y'all door to door like groupon , been off that shit
suggest you go and get a job and try to catch up quick
dealing with jazmin last night on some catch up shit
she thinking i done changed , a young and grown up quick
so i split
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah
praise the gun you gon' have to praise the shooter x4
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah
praise the gun you gon' have to praise the shooter x4
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah
praise the gun you gon' have to praise the shooter x4
hallelujah , hallelujah , hallelujah
praise the gun you gon' have to praise the shooter x4
yeah , it's that joint that make your head nod
rest in peace , big pun , this my terror squad
you don't want me on your songs , it's the fear of god
i remember when they said my verses wasn't hard
now what's the motive , i'm trying to cop the lotus
driving around town , wave my hand like the potus
fat boy , larger than life , they all notice
when niggas think you on , they lining up to be your soldiers
but being broke is like waking up with folgers
turn the lights on , we watching roaches
i swore i wouldn't change , spent my money on material things
me and my niggas roll tough like we started a gang
fucked a couple broads once , now they calling to hang
dho told me let them be if they don't call you by name
floor seats , madison square , just catching the game
