they swear niggas win when they sin the most
temporarily be the toast
guns and butter on what matters the least , watch them overdose
let them hang , nigga , hang by their gold ropes
smoke dope until you're comatose , no hope
for that butter , niggas die broke , third eye woke
poke holes in the american dream , run out of options
made it easy , you can hustle and scheme but one problem
they're building private prisons just to house niggas
for cheap labor , that's why , nigga
they call it pic , it's not a club , but you're vip
series of numbers that replace your id
home of the cowardly , freedom ain't free
the revolution won't be shown on tv
we're too busy watching fake reality , you see
what goes up comes down
dog chase tail , go 'round and 'round
we all hypnotized when we hear the sounds
ever seen a clown with a smile that was upside down
you see it
they swear we going to the promise land ( right )
they swear they better than the better man ( right )
we need to get our shit together man ( right )
probably listening like , whatever man
they swear niggas be killing when they're just killing
waking up every morning , hollow , no feeling
you hear the rap , money stack , how it touch the ceiling
got to tell my nephews , they really have a ceiling
that's to be honest , you ain't getting everything that's promised
40 acres and a mule , right , work so they can take
cost of living tax 'til your back break
no grass , but you're still missing the snakes , til they slither on you
who tired of looking at the middle man
the one on top , so he devised a plan
and who too busy thinking promised land
then realize the real lies pinpoint the scam
shooting the messenger , that's only part of our conditioning
they keep trying to tell us but we're not listening
you want to hide it , put it in a book
they want to hide it , put it on a corner , watch it cook , you see it
