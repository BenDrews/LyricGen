time to wake they ass up , niggas sleeping on me still
better hit ya snooze button , who fronting niggas lunching'
clock punching but you telling me how to do my j - o
should be on that shawty lo diet , dunny they know
who the best is and who the rest is
poke my chest out like 2 breast is
don't forget the message
disposing of you wannabes the flow is so precious
fat shit meshes like a blend
backspin shall i pretend
you can hold a candle to my everlasting zeal
be real nigga , i kill niggas
i don't feel what the rest of them be talking 'bout
a bunch of gossiping bitches , little richard
take a picture , these scriptures pulsating through your eardrum
if you feel like you really want it , come and get some
chilled long enough , played the back , now i'm at where
rosa parks sat , couple lashes on the back
imagine that , it's a wrap for you muhfuckas
nah really it's a wrap if you plan on setting traps
i advise that you think about it cousin
i give you 4 bars while my phone buzzing
hold on...
my mama ain't raise no fool
you niggas is cool and cool kids fail classes
passed all of mine , i'm a master
hip hop fascism , haves and have - nots rap classism , do the knowledge
i dropped out of high school but i finished college
young man with a lot of mileage
fuck the little kid games , i'm working on my aim
starting not to feel shit like i took some novacane
the pain in your side that'll never subside
you can run , you can hide , i will find you
nigga i'll remind you , i'm killing you , the chalk outlined you
if you that nice , ( huh ) why nobody signed you
the skills outshine you , bars unparalleled
you fear me like a 2 man cell
i excel where you ended , 48 laws i amended
fucking with me not recommended
nigga start shit , i will end it
it's more like a scrimmage , better yet a practice
your effort deemed hapless
young cats are classless
a couple of 'em nice but the rest of 'em actresses
