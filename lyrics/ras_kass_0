with the phenotypical trait , genetic recessive
blue eyes , blonde hair and white skin
albinism apparently was a sin to the original man , africans
so the mutants traveled north of the equator
called europeans later , the first race haters
so here's the devil's alpha to the beta

cause christ was not his name , that's greek for " one who is anointed "
yeshua ben yosef was his name , do christians know this ?
so who do you praise , do you know his name

accepting the religion they gave slaves to behave
peep the description of historian josephus
" short , dark , with an underdeveloped beard was jesus "
he had the romans fearin' revolution

in his vision , it read *in hoc signo vinces*
" in this sign we conquer " - manifest destiny
in 325 he convened the nicene creed
and separated god into three

in the eight century muslims conquered
spain , portugal and france and controlled it for 700 years
they never mention this in history class
cause o'fays are threatened when you get the real lesson
moors from baghdad , turkey threatened european christians
meaning , the white way of life ; hence the crusades for christ
on november 25th , 1491
santiago defeats the last muslim stronghold , granada
king ferdinand gave thanks to god for victory
and the pope of rome and declared this date to forever be
a day of " thanksgiving " for all european christians
now listen , when you celebrate " thanksgiving "
what you are actually celebrating
is the proclamation of the pope of rome
who later , in league with queen isabella
sent cardinal ximenos to spain
to murder any blacks that resisted christianity
these moors , these black men and women were from baghdad , turkey
and today , you eat the turkey , for your " thanksgiving " day
as the european powers destroyed the turkeys
who were the forefathers of your mothers and fathers
now fight the power , you bitch - ass niggas

as tokens of peace , sir jeffery amherst
passed out clothing and blankets to the indian community
infested with small pox , knowing they had no immunity
today it's aids , you best believe it's man made
cause ain't a damn thing changed , let me explain
now since people of color are genetically dominant
and caucasoids are genetically recessive
and whites expect to be predominant , meaning survive as a race then
they simply must , take precautions
that's why they're worried about their future now
cause by 2050 , almost all the earth's population
will be brown
then black , so understandin' that , whites counter - react
* ( man i'm saying , the fools ain't nothing but a teaspoon of milk in a world coloured with joy ) *
so they created a system
to force blacks into an unnatural position
that re - enforces the position of natural inferiority
in addition , created guns and developed the ethnocentric view
that god justifies every fuckin' thing they do
condition people to perceive whites' culture as civilized
and every other culture considered primitive - not true
racism is the system of racial subjugation against non - whites
in every areas of human relation

but before slaves came here whites would take a
pregnant woman , hang her from a tree by her toes
slice her stomach with a knife and let the unborn baby fall to the flo'
and stomp an unborn child in front of all the slaves
to inbreed fear , so they'd be scared and behave
and not rebel more
understand all whites must be perceived as potential predators
i paraphrase historian ishakamusa barashango
" understand that regardless of the lofty ideas engraved on paper
in such documents as the constitution or declaration
the basic nature of the european american white man
remains virtually unchanged "
so , check
this is the nature of the threat
