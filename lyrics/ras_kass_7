" soul on ice "
i was told two wrongs don't make a right but three rights make a left
act your age not your color , but i'd rather act darker
mark a page with mazes of labyrinth
fuck up a rhyme so bad i leave the microphone abstinent
to mc or not to mc ?
beyond b.e.t. and mtv exists me
origin cause god created man and man created hip hop
i declined to participate until i was orientated
i heard 50 , 000 drivebys and 49 , 999 was lies
no surprise , as the sun rises , thine eyes have seen the light
but we stalk the night , i expose like an overbite
in limbo i lamp , rape the lady kill the tramp
the wrong action for the right motive , so now
give me 50 , 000 black angry role models
take me to dc i'll throw the first fuckin' bottle
cause i don't give a fuck about a menial existence
and i don't give a fuck about nonviolent resistance
civil rights will not suffice
in the name of jesus christ they got my soul on ice
" soul on ice " ( x25 )
walkin' on skulls cause i'm two steps ahead so i started at square three
now i'm cubed like o'shea jackson be
subzero catching fatalities to my spirituality
smoke like a chimney , drink like a kennedy
still no remedy
fuck shooting a fair one
cause open cuts from fuckin' some nigga up
can lead to contracting hiv positivity
you never know who got traits of femininity
what agwan , pussy wool blood clot
and deal with the bullshit batty - boy business fi' dat
you play the villain
there will be another soundboy killin'
benadryl pumps through my adrenaline
feelin' my raps weight , i track heavy like tony dofat
hip hop is 2% milk but mostly no fat
and most mcs ain't prepared
so what i say goes over your head like pubic hair
in 1999 ( flip the script ) triple six
one world government " novus ordo seclorum "
check your dead president , represented on the one dollar bill
and if clinton was the answer it was a stupid question
my soul's on ice , baby
