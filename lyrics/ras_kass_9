reinvent
what's the mathematic pi ?
what's humble pi
think about it
annunaki chocolate darren aronofsky
word in my balls , shining like swarovski
never needed swag , politics , or paparazzi
i'd rather knock a foxy chick pop gestapo nazi's
hot by proxy , i rhymed with the greatest mc's
pandemic , this the latest disease
no skills , million rappers claim they trappin' with keys
so i swing across bars like the flying trapeze
socal , where i was conceived
another l.a. king , the meek die on their knees
cause of greed , mama used to read proverb 16
( pride comes before a fall , lose it all )
and that's when you see who really got ya back
rassy bring the city joy like the shaq attack
black mac benz wagon with the matching hat
this is backpack ratchet , nigga action packed
and most of y'all garbage homie facts is facts
even if you paid big bucks to get fucked and dick sucked
hiccup then lick nuts for platinum plaques
hope you pickin' up what i'm puttin' down , wack is wack jack
ungrateful thanksgiving , they feasted on ribs gave us intestines where the shits been , we made that chitlins
necessity's the mother of inventions
my light bulb go off cause i don't like wishin'
keep reinventing
my nigga , have you ever dated a white girl ?
y'all break up and argue then she call you the n word
( damn , aight girl )
not n - i - g - g - a , n - i - g - g - e - r
entice you to strike her so you can see these bars
i'm missy elliot like he - he - he - he - ha
you are not needed trollop , not you or vcrâ€™s
i'm somewhere on krypton and you just see these stars
parallel universe , free - throw shootin' meteors
and slam dunkin' planets
my semantics damn near tantric
dorothy came to kansas
you was never on my bandwidth
and fuck fm radio stations you complacent
cause y'all play the most ignorant songs in creation
wayne said he'd make these hoes love em like satan
jay partnered with barney's with racial discrimination
and kanye gear sport confederate flags
his ancestors severed heads was in confederate bags
and this ain't hate , this just the truth
about when blacks escape the concrete jungle , and lose humble
humility's a blessing and many men have tumbled
off that pedestal soon as your foundation crumbles
beef sausage in my gumbo
pourin' out liquor for my grandparents and uncle
who i get drunk for , californication no runkle
blue leather belt , big silver h on the buckle
ebbs and flows , made a modest living off rapping
can't say i'm ballin' i'm still tryna make it happen
impregnate the beat and murk it like rae carruth
stand on dr. king's mountaintop and raise the roof
