yo yo
now who's ready
this is like a nine held steady
reflect and slice like a machete
atomic bomb shot ( ? ) through your section
i describe my styles in the forms of deadly weapons
this is special operations
look at what you facing
a loud noise that'll leave you faceless
deadly weapons
so keep stepping in that forward direction
fuck with rashid and seek orders of protection
perfection i'm blessing the mic
from the left to the right
i can't lose what i was destined to fight
you see them niggas
( ? ) make you question your rights
well if it ain't one of them
( ? ) canon shots will be the blanket that'll cover him
put you to sleep and tuck you in
sing you a lullaby from within
straight from the heart
separate a blaze from a spark
obliviate your fate , too late to make remarks nigga
this full clip will make you do a full flip
a man told me bullshit will only put you in an early grave
you niggas got girly ways and its pitiful
deadly weapons up in your section , the original
yo yo
now who's ready
this is like a nine held steady
reflect and slice like a machete
atomic bomb shot ( ? ) through your section
i describe my styles in the forms of deadly weapons
( x2 )
now what's the outcome ?
no rapper surviving this blast
from the split of a single atom of hydrogen
you better off drinking a tablespoon of nitrogen
the livest men are hotter than twenty capsules of niacin
but still give the cold shoulder
biological war spreads attacks and spreads without order
the rock of gibralter
my finder tips finger flip boulders and crews
the valentine's day massacre , i'm bad news
to homosexual crews i'm giving yall brain convulsions
pushing you with the force of a fighter planes propulsion
official scud missile posted like a sultan
who's the culprit
got me chopping like bullets shot from revolvement nigga
my magazine was empty in the ( ? )
so i upgraded my caliber to 20 millimeters
against dictatorship i fight for my freedom
throw em up , 21 gun shot salute for allegiance
( sample : jeru the damaja )
( ? ) out the barrel , the chamber , from the chamber
yo yo
now who's ready
this is like a nine held steady
reflect and slice like a machete
atomic bomb shot ( ? ) through your section
i describe my styles in the forms of deadly weapons
