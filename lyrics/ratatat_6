i've never hurt this
i've never hurt this way before
i've never hurt this
i've never hurt this way before
you waited for the lightning storm
though it might be gone
created for the life reborn
though it might be long
too late to change the road we're on
though it might be wrong
we've come so far , what are you running for ?
don't leave me out , the world's in front of us
you waited for the lightning storm
though it might be gone
created for the life reborn
though it might be wrong
i've never hurt this
i've never hurt this way before
i've never hurt this
i've never hurt this way before
