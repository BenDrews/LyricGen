brooklyn , yo
eyo , it's the ill na na baby !
brooklyn , let's get it in
i've been a star since a virgin in highschool
since the age of fourteen i've been a rap bitch version of mike ? ? ?
and i don't know how to trust , the church or the rifle
god or the devil , the burner or the bible
got a black cloud on me , i've been cursed by my right ones
i'm back bitches ! the retun of ya idol
f - to - the - o - x , b - double - o
black hand keep them lambos and them black impalas
i wreck the style homie , ain't a bitch chilla
i fucks with gangstas baby , like prince miller
and when they locked tuquan , i felt the east split up
he and his feds , but he left his legacy in killa
i keep my killaz on that brooklyn shit
fox ripped the world like the brooklyn bridge
i'm back now , brooklyn ain't never looked this big
i hold it down while y'all lookin' for big
next blakka miss
i'm in my own fuckin' world , i speak how i feel
sometimes i feel like i'm just too fuckin' real
foxy brown uh , what the deal is ?
they ain' got a clue what we about to do
fb ! you know what it is
az of course
what up boogz ? you know i would if i could
bring the hood on the v.i. , my man from c.i
said his ball was in the mess hall witchu at jail time
lookin' like you was right at your crib in alpine
no signs of a warrior's face
i know you sprayed if your peer wasn't so soft while he helped you escape
but on the real , we never got a chance to build
with all the bullshit somebody shoulda told you to kill
to the steel , so many rappers lost they mind
like twentyfive to life never forced they mind
your moms cryin' , we spoke , i almost choked
was there the same day to brought yo ass up in the post
it's getting close , see you soon , sometime in june
utilize the red goons for yo mind to bloom
a flesh wound always heal , but death that's it
i'ma go now , but let that sit
