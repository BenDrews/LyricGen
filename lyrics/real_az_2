i'm all about this moolah , i'm all about this bread
and if i get caught slippin' , i can end up in the feds
bitch better have my money , nigga better have my money
bitch better have my money , nigga better have my money
my man , baby mom , in the morning , tell him " gm "
kiss him on the forehead take the keys to his bm
ain't even gon' tell you , got the code to his diem
i hit her on the 'gram like hashtag free 'em
i'm biased , but all i got for these hoes is papaya
i done drove ever car , no liar
i ain't talking music when i say i did shit with mariah
nick wasn't there , nor was mottola
sittin' on the crates , gun in the stroller
i was selling coke , no joke , no cola

i pulled up onside the real az
and i was young when they tried to kill az
we kept it mob style like whip ?
audemars styling on the wristwatch
still do harlem in my flip - flops
summertime , hoppin' out the 'rari with the missing top
living life big , this that mo' money shit
so no matter what i get , i'm screaming " mo' money , bitch ! "
mo' money coming in , mo' money spent
smelling like money , that's that mo' money scent
amg kit , this that mo' money band
knock - knock open the door , i'm letting mo' money in
she like , " what's this 'mo' money' shit ? "
i'm like " them niggas that you with , i'm getting mo' money than "
pockets full of chuck - e - cheese
i'm under the money tree and i'm just catching all the leaves
she just want to feel the breeze
i just want her on her knees , cold nigga , antifreeze
