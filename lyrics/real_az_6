icu , icu
i see you tryin' to kill 'em but do it with class
they scooting us back and using the past
won't tell the youth if they ask
i speak the truth and it last
sorry i'm begging no pardons
my homies tell me i'm heartless
i'm a get paid that's regardless
squad hit the strip when i call 'em
piling up chips cause we all in
got them sick like who let y'all in
for talkin' slick it's no resolvin'
cause they disrespect for no reason
no , they disrespect for no reason
probably cause they in their feelings
man i ain't tripping i'm just tryin' to live it's ...
my life , you decide yours
live rich or die poor
remember i'd kill for a choice
now it's suicide doors
feel hella dope in my shades i can tell you wanna throw shade of course
you still playin' i'm out makin' plays
guess i got stuck in my ways not sure
but somehow they hate a lil more
all cause i made a lil more
i need that paper galore
done doin' favors i'm done with patience
till they count up my money in stacks and lace my bitches all with dime figures
they align with us for they five minutes i'm like time tickin' , this fame ain't a biggie really all eyes only see a bunch of bad boys like shyne lyrics before the crime sentence - yea
kind of niggas hang and bang in the streets
god my witness i'm just saying the least
they eat and won't save us a piece so i'm saying my piece niggas stay wit the _______
it's work everyday of the week
i'm telling myself when i sleep
like yo ! you gon' wake up , got a mission - aye
juug with the bros and we split it four ways
dig , i did this for the digits
my realaz my hittaz , gon' hear this and feel it like - whew
cop out the thrift and i make it brand new
hot box the whip catch a lift and i cruise
not bein' modest i'm just hard to digest
can tell in my conscience these people ain't conscious
in the subconscious , i'm suffering from the insomnia
midnight killer i go jeffrey dahmer
drowsy i look at the time and , its 4am
still up for certain a workaholic like its four of him
niggas bleed like us if he can take it then it's for him
lord them - devils gon' try to come capture me won't they
least i know who gon' come back for me only
sure of it homie ; you sure that's yo homie ? ( what )
thought at the top it was lonely ( where )
soon as it's real they get phony ( when )
feel like yo chick wanna clone me ( who )
but that's another topic i'm off it - damn
you want a lam then go cop a lam
you got a plan then stick by yo plan
say that's yo man then go profit then
god on my side so i gotta win
