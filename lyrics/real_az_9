you gave her all your time
you were so happy she liked you
you always listened to her and you
shared all your thoughts
and she was glad to have met you
as time went by she realazed that you changed
she cut her hair you didn't notice
a thing
you gatta do the things that you use to do 'cause if you don't shes ganna say to you
she ain't coming back no more
she ain't coming back no more no more
