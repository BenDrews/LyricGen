cheddar wanna feelin the pit of your chicks stomach
dumb it down regal how we livin at the summit
funny how they doubt it but now they sayin they love it
claimin that they betta but no when they stay bluffin
i've been living this crazy life
trying to get cream , kid
just a youngin' growing up in the bean
smoking and drinking is all the i need
couple bad bitches that do what i please
every morning that i wake up
light a joint , get high , cause there's levels to this shit
heavy with spliffs
turned your bitch from a regular chick to a hell of a stoner
i am a loner , see me on mars
you did the whip but i'm copping the cars
think that's your shit but that's probably ours
my homie juice , he got some bars
but you know i'm gonna keep up
i am like someone you can't give a mid - level grade to
you can't see us , doing shots off her body that's d - cups
got the bm parked next to you chick's house
got the weed on the low for the discount
when i creep with the flow no dismount
i stick landings , i'm outstanding
my new girl , she doing her damn thing
light up a joint and you know i be lamping
write up a verse and compete with the damn king
i am the reason these rappers are scrambling
but it's cool i'm just living like fuck
i ain't giving no fucks what it does
i ain't paying ten bucks for the club
now it's only my crew that i run with
no new friends , but then tell me who runs this
i am just trying to turn up no synth board
making these memories all that i live for , peace
