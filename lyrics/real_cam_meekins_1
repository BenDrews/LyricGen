so , the negro can now unconsciously cry out with the eloquent poet ,
fleecy locks and black complexion
cannot forfeit natureâ€™s claim.
skin may differ , but affection
dwells in black and white the same.
were i so tall as to reach the pole
or to grasp at the ocean at a span ,
i must be measured by my soul
and so i go back to the south not in despair. i go back to the south not with a feeling that we are caught in a dark dungeon that will never lead to a way out. i go back believing that the new day is coming. and so this afternoon , i have a dream. ( go ahead ) it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream.
i have a dream that one day , right down in georgia and mississippi and alabama , the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to live together as brothers.
i have a dream this afternoon ( i have a dream ) that there will be a day that we will no longer face the atrocities that emmett till had to face or medgar evers had to face , that all men can live with dignity.
yes , i have a dream this afternoon that one day in this land the words of amos will become real and " justice will roll down like waters , and righteousness like a mighty stream. "
i have a dream this afternoon that the brotherhood of man will become a reality in this day.
and with this faith i will go out and carve a tunnel of hope through the mountain of despair. with this faith , i will go out with you and transform dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows. with this faith , we will be able to achieve this new day when all of god's children , black men and white men , jews and gentiles , protestants and catholics , will be able to join hands and sing with the negroes in the spiritual of old :
free at last ! free at last !
