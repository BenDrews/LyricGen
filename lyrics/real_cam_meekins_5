ayo , sometimes i get annoyed , man , i wish that i knew maggie more
every time i fucking text with her she's acting like she's bored
it's probably cause i'm acting different than i usually do
that's just cause i'm not like other guys that's using you
to get the ass ; man i get nervous when i think about her
( what's the deal ? ) man i don't know , it's just something about her
the way she dresses , maybe it's her confidence
but i can't even get her over to my apartment ( but i won't trip )
i got the sense to pick apart the thoughts i'm thinking
let her know she could have everything that i have
it stinks , she don't understand it , she thinks i'm fucking cuties
i'm a musician , girl , i do it for the love , not the groupies
( hold up , so what you're saying is you care about this girl ? )
yeah , yeah , i know i'm supposed to act tough , but i don't know
fuck the fact that i ain't fully figured out my life
before the fact that i ain't had a girlfriend that i care about with all my might
man i could act tough , ignore her when she text me
but that ain't me , man , i don't like to flex , see
( is she sexy ? ) man she's like the greatest thing i've ever seen
i'd compliment her more , but i ain't tryna be obscene
this the girl i'd go to church with , the girl i think is worth it
she thinking about if me and her could ever work
it's kinda worthless , i guess , writing a song about my feelings
i'm too emotional , get overstressed about these things
but when we did hang out , i think she had a good time
understand that people hurt her in the past , i can't lie
i wish that i could let her know in person how i feel
i wish i knew her better cause i know this shit is real
every day i get up , pray , thinking bout all the things to say
well i hope she realize i'm here to stay
so maggie , if you're listening , i'm sorry for my insecurities
it's cause you're beautiful , i hope that you can see
i wanna let you know i got feelings
i wanna take you out to get earrings
but i'm scared you don't think that i'm legit
i know you think i'll run away , but girl , i never quit
i wanna let you know i'm not fooling
i wanna hug you tight like my shoestrings
these fucking choruses aren't making any sense
cause i'm always flusterated when or not to send a text
ayo , sometimes i get it wrong , man
sometimes i'm worried bout impressing you , maggie
if you can hear the things i'm too nervous to text you
maybe you would understand i'm tryna take it slow
there's no need to rush ourselves into a situation , yo
if the feelings are there , we gotta bunch of time to grow
i never want to make you feel uncomfortable and go
no matter what the situation physically or mentally
or medically , i'll give you anything , a friend to me
you truly have been , so without a doubt
we ran around new york city and i made you smile
i took you to times square , we had our first kiss
but what you didn't know is that you're on my bucket list
i wanna let you know i got feelings
i wanna take you out to get earrings
but i'm scared you don't think that i'm legit
i know you think i'll run away , but girl , i never quit
i wanna let you know i'm not fooling
i wanna hug you tight like my shoestrings
these fucking choruses aren't making any sense
cause i'm always flusterated whether or not we can have sex
