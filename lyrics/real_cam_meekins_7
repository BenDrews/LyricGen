i think about this chick , man she was alright
she used to skip class with me and ride around in the night
i never thought a lot of it
i tried to keep it cool
till she hooked up with other kids runnin' round the school
stupid shit how you do that girl
i used to complain 'bout bitches now you that girl
now i'm hearin' 'bout how everybody screwed that girl
it didn't take long for you to act a fool damn girl
now this highschool shit be gettin' real old
try to tell the teachers that we done but they still old
don't wanna listen to us
our fuckin' generation
well they can all go fuck themselves like some masturbation
thats an exaggeration
i sit up in my room and think about all of the fucked up shit i do
my homie its all cool
i'm gonna finish school
then scream peace like the middle eastern egypt dudes
i won't have to take no more cause i can't
i'm tryna break free of this fuckin' place
i'm bored
ya know i won't hesitate no more cause i can't
i'm tryna break free of this fuckin' place
i'm bored
damn man wheres your motherfuckin' manners
i spit like a dumbass and fly around saturn
my brain smoked out
put myself on a platter
so any fuckin rapper tryna diss me doesnt matter
and i'm more bored than four george foremans
sleepin' on the porch in the middle of a storm
and what its what we do round here
cause there ain't nothing to do but straight cruise round here
its the simple life , gettin' pretty borin'
i never finished my work i wanna tour man
lay of the floor playin' chillin' like an old man
then i roll joints with gruber
thats four hands
tryna keep shit hot i open up shops
spit pop and spit rock and still rock some dumb socks
the skinny kid with the game on smash
you don't like it motherfucker you can kiss my ass
well you done done me in your bed i felt it
but its all good cause i be makin' the best of it
fell right through the cracks
now its my life that i get back
yeah man gotta find somethin to do
its all good
