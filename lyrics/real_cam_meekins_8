at the top of the world where it’s all just fine
even if time slows down its all alright
at the top of the world i can see you there
even if time slows down i don’t have a care
at the top of the world where it’s all just fine
even if time slows down its all alright
at the top of the world i can see you there
even if time slows down i don’t have a care
on a front page
we be living it large we on a big stage , changed in a big way
me and you played , played like a guitar
my heart aches when i think about the old days
and the slow dance
back in 10th grade , i had no chance
i was livin’ it large with no romance
never looking at stars and just chill man , i never had no plans
but as things changed , me and you grew older in a diff way
started seeing the world with a new face
but i still show love ‘cause i got to
you made me that stupid way
i remember we would blaze by the bleachers
never went to school ‘cause we hated all the teachers
got big dreams , you my girl now
it’s all good ‘cause we on top of the world now
it’s all good now
top down in the whip , my hands out thinking “damn cam look now”
and my mom proud
‘cause i’m up on stage singing my songs now , we gon’ sell them all out
but you backstage , and i’m bringing it back in to them past days
back when we first met what would your dad say
now were falling in love lets just runaway
it’s so tough when we livin’ it up
but then we broke up ‘cause i wasn’t giving a fuck
but when you come back seeing i was a changed man
we gon’ shut it all down , yeah dog game plan
so tell me what does it take to keep it real
theres a war going in my heart girl still
and i’m speaking the truth better believe it
we on top of the world i don’t know if you can see it
we grow up , grow apart
i don’t know , who you are
you don’t know , where i been
we don’t care ‘cause we going
we grow up , grow apart
i don’t know , who you are
you don’t know , where i been
we don’t care ‘cause we going
when it’s all done
i’ma get my phone and get my call on
‘cause i don’t care about this shit in the long run
big moments fade away when i think about the small ones
when it’s all done
i’ma get my phone and get my call on
‘cause i don’t care about this shit in the long run
big moments fade away when i think about the small ones
