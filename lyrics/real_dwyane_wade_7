yo , i wake up , make a k - cup then i blaze up , shave with a razor blade
my hat is still crooked , i'm reading a book and my body was made in maine
man , i'm still deflecting all the bill collectors and i hate when they say my name
my buzz would be massive if i wasn't slacking and jerking to jayden jaymes
celtics sticker on the bumper of a clunker but my vocals real
fuck rap , i might sell my mic and buy a snowmobile
i can't relate to throwing money when she makes it clap
i can relate to doing dishes , we should take a nap
tired like michelin of your wrists when they're glistening
we don't want no yacht to float but just a boat to go fishing in
man my whole yard is a minor mess , go hard till my dying breath
owe bars to the irs , we got no rs in our dialect
me and my peeps speak a different kind of speech
where verizon 4g won't reach ( can you hear me now ? )
we're coming live from where mill towns are still towns
even though they shut the mills down
but i'm feeling like the king of maine , the king of maine
i wear a seal - skin jersey to the sea dogs game
i'm the king of maine , the king of maine
plow truck all gold , never hydroplane
i tell em : welcome to 207 , welcome - welcome to 207
welcome to 207 , welcome - welcome to 207
it's the way life should be , everything's pleasant
tell 'em : this - th - th - this is 207
hey , i heard the news in the street ( what's that ? )
that we're the shit and you're the pubes on the seat
even though i triple bogey that par 5 , rangoon with my mai tai
steal another motherfucker wi - fi , got texas pete on my five guys
i'm back , facts : spit a little bit but i never made a gat go
" cap , cap , pap , " but my backpack on and i'm smoking
being homeless is bogus , paying bills is my motive
can't afford g4s , i'm poor on tour in a worn '04 ford focus
ayup , i know that this weed might be the death of me
but i got this o broke up like it's parentheses
i'm yelling " ayup , " i weigh a buck forty still
but when my finger tips touch the quill , i'll be feeling like i'm
paul pierce and i'm rondo , i'm john deere and i'm john doe
i'm the rap star from the back yard who never act hard or went half - heart
i'm the peoples douche , aka the truth
every time that i get in the booth , i'll be feeling like
the king of maine , the king of maine
if you're batman , i must be l.l. bane
i'm the king of maine , the king of maine
i got susan collins giving everyone brain
i tell em : welcome to 207 , welcome - welcome to 207
welcome to 207 , welcome - welcome to 207
it's the way life should be , everything's pleasant
tell 'em : this - th - th - this is 207
i'm from the 420 minus 213
i'm on the throne if you're looking for who to unseat
i got moose blood in my goblet , lobsters in my optics
i'm live on the map where the dudes don't rap in the altima black
when i do go past , come hop in , whoo ! find me chillin' in rockland
where the townies sell oxys so the coroners got coffins
it's my fault i'm paid , because of what i say
i rock it for a profit , pockets fat as paul lepage
got a tattoo on my arm that says " don't stop "
â€˜cause other guys told me otherwise when we talked
i told 'em wells , maine what the sign say , where i go ape with my primates
rhyme great , 16s like 2 times 8 , wine grapes and prime steaks
damn , i'm feeling marvelous
had a hand with no good cards in it that i parted with , i'm an artisan
i think you're an amateur , kids , cops , janitors
all pull out their cameras when i walk out of hannaford
the king of maine , the king of maine
i got a fucking elk head hanging on my chain
the king of maine , the king of maine
and all the state game wardens yell my name
i tell em : welcome to 207 , welcome - welcome to 207
welcome to 207 , welcome - welcome to 207
it's the way life should be , everything's pleasant
tell em : this - th - th - this is 207
watching the celtics !
pierce , final seconds , pierce puts it up , for the win
