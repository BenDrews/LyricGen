intro
big money x 5 ( hey , hey , hey )
chorus x 2
u got big money
u drive fancy cars
everybody know u
its like u a trapstar
breakin down brix , choppin up o’s x 2
verse 1
got the arm and hammer
but you ain’t workin with no nails
you cut the cake
now you straight catchin sales
you break down brix
call you demolition man
you got a chunk
now you poppin rubber bands
ya pack heat
just like dwyane wade
got you blowin up
like you swallowed a hand grenade
got the toilet paper
because you know you the shit
got the a1's
got the keys
u got a chevy
sittin on the truck front
you got them gals
and you don’t even know they name
smoke dat'
hundred fifty a quarter
now you pushin that blow
like katrina
when it hit the n.o
the block is like jiggas
everybody know ya name
the real niggas
we love you to death
the fake niggas
wish you took yo last breath
and throw larger amounts
even through
even through the mothafuckin drought
chorus x2
verse 2
you go to club
you never wait in line
roll micheal vicks
like every first time
if ya crap out
you got money in the bank
if u go to jail
you got money to make bail
when u smile
chandeliers in your grill
you’s a cake daddy
you keep them gals so clean
they burn yo pockets
just like gasoline
got cars and houses
all in they last name
got 26's
with the lambo doors
with the flip down
while u watchin they flick
up in the back
turn it up
yo back window might crack
got the powder
but u don’t mess with all that
not a pimp
but you keep that mack
call u santa claus
‘cause u keep a big sack
adversaries
wanna see u dead
hit the price
up on they head
on the fall of e.t
the fed know the number
they don’t know where you are
turn it on
