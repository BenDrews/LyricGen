after hours of ill mulino
or sotto sotto , just talkin' about women and vino
the contract like '91 dan marino
i swear this got michael rapino boostin' my ego
overly focused , it's far from the time to rest now
debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
took a while , got the jokers out of the deck now
holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
i hear you talkin' , say it twice so i know you meant it
fuck it , i don't even tint it , they should know who's in it
i'm authentic , real name , no gimmicks
no game , no scrimmage , i ain't playin' with you niggas at all
my classmates , they went on to be chartered accountants
or work with their parents , but thinkin' back on how they treated me
my high school reunion might be worth an appearance
make everybody have to go through security clearance
tables turn , bridges burn , you live and learn
with the ink , i could murder word to my nigga irv
yeah , i swear shit just started clickin' dog
you know it's real when you are who you think you are
i had benzes 'fore you had braces
the all black maybach but i'm not a racist
inside's whiter than katy perry's face is
yellow diamonds in my jesus
i just might learn to speak mandarin
japanese for the yen that i'm handlin'
international hov , that's my handle
my saint's sean don , light a candle
el gran santo on the mantle
'case y'all didn't know , i speak spanish too
shoutout to worldwide wes
everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess
yes , still roc la familia
says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
the homie said " hov , it ain't many of us "
i told him less is more , nigga it's plenty of us
cake , cake cake cake cake cake
500 million , i got a pound cake
niggas is frontin' , that's upside - down cake
get 'em a red nose , they clown cakes
they shoulda' never let you 'round cake
look at my neck , i got a carrot cake
now here's the icing on the cake
cake , cake cake cake cake
i'm just gettin' started , oh yeah we got it bitch
i've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
dame made millions , bigg made millions
ye made millions , just made millions
lyor made millions , cam made millions
beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
i'm back in my bag
my eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
a pair of jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
gucci air bag just in case we crash
uh , last night was mad trill
fresh out of advil , jesus grab the wheel
