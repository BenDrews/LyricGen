biggest boss and i've been the trillest
i'm a bigger problem when i click with skrillex
murder on my mind , it's time to pray to god
my revolver's not religious , the revolution’s born
you wanna know my name then go and tell the serg'
you wanna know my gang : suicide squad
pistol on my waist , i might make a mistake
deadshot , head shot , oh my god , am i crazy ?
drugs every corner , this is gotham city
killer croc came to kidnap you to cut out your kidney
ain't no mercy , got that purple lamborghini lurkin'
rozay , don't you know that pussy worth it ?
flooded rolex at the grammy awards
they still sellin' dope , that's those miami boys
killers everywhere , it ain't no place to run
forgive me for my wrongs , i have just begun
ain't no mercy , a - ain't no mercy
got that purple lamborghini , purple lamborghini lurkin'
ain't no mercy , a - ain't no mercy
got that purple lamborghini lurkin ( rozay ! )
don't be beggin' for your life 'cause that's a lost cause
high stakes , body armor , suicide , boy
it's a time for games and it's a time to kill
make up your mind , baby , 'cause the time is here
capital murder , capital letters
yeah , she catchin' my vibe , but she can't fathom my cheddar
need a couple gang members for these new endeavors
from this point on anything we do we do together
body on the corner , million in the trunk
seven figures , i spend that every other month
killers on the corner , talons in the clip
build a palace out in paris just to fill with bitches
say my name and i’m coming with the gun squad
everybody runnin' , homie , there’s only one god
cocaine white ferrari , i'm in the fast lane
every day was life and death , that's when the cash came
count money , drug residue , even blood on ‘em
he had a driver 'til i put my cuz on it
kickin' in the door , boy , suicide squad
needle in my arm so i'm do or die for it
ain't no mercy , a - ain't no mercy
got that purple lamborghini , purple lamborghini lurkin'
ain't no mercy , a - ain't no mercy
got that purple lamborghini lurkin' , ( rozay ! )
