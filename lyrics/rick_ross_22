what is this ? maybach music
i like this maybach music
she's just perfect in every kinda way
but i don't think i can handle her pain
so messed up and i'm too busy just running my game
oh , girl after girl , mistake after mistake
i've tried to change but they always around , pulling me down in bed
gave you my word but they were just broken promises
broken condoms , lipstick marks and unprotected sex
i feel like shit , you know i ain't shit
sorry , won't turn back the clock
baby i took advantage cause i knew you
wouldn't believe it , so i used you
i'm sorry , oh i'm sorry don't make it right , i know
we at the crib , she got her legs wrapped around my waist
conversation , she lick every tattoo that's on my face
like a thug , i just wanna fuck , that's every day
temporary separations , confessin' my mistakes
she packed her bags and left me home and i'm still hurt
you new pussy , but she can't tell me that it's real first
a lot of lies apologized , the thirst real
when she hear this thinking to herself , " damn this verse real "
rehab out in vegas , that made this a murdered sin
sent the bottles to her table then made love on the jet
temporary thrills , all these women you think i tossed
my feelings genuine , disregard what you see on blogs
i been a boss before i recorded meek song
mill in cash on the gram , they trending meech home
in the d and my g , he throwin' that p - stone
every picture that you post , we comments on each one
i'm just a typical ordinary nigga
but i know that i can't change the rules
all this time i blamed you cause i know what i'm doing
stepping on your heart again , relationship ruined
i tried to change but i'm always out , fucking around in the club
pieces of my love letter tore up from this break up
my worst nightmare went right in my back , i wish i could wake up
i feel like shit , know i ain't shit but i'm
sorry , won't turn back the clock
baby i took advantage cause i knew you
wouldn't believe it , so i used you
i'm sorry , oh i'm sorry don't make it right , i know
life's short and baby girl you deserve a winner
every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger
hustle from my heart so every night i can deliver
sayin' sorry , layin' up , i'm way up in your liver
boss , the red bottoms got you walkin' funny
get you an agent , she ballin' and all she talk is money
take her shoppin' , baby boy ain't no salary caps
she get it poppin' so you better bring battery packs
perfect time to relax
nothing is perfect other than me and the perfect match
they all watch me cause the moves i make out they budget
diamond district , six figures on my shorty nugget
i've tried to change but they always around , pulling me down in bed
gave you my word but they were just broken promises
broken condoms , lipstick marks and unprotected sex
i feel like shit , you know i ain't shit
sorry , won't turn back the clock
baby i took advantage cause i knew you
wouldn't believe it , so i used you
i'm sorry , oh i'm sorry don't make it right
