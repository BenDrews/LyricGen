a egg of that girl i'll knock ya mommy and ya daddy off
fuck around and knock the emblem on the caddy off
four shooters buggin' out , blickin' at ya caddy doors
did i mention guns from red dead redemption
nine mils , fifty clip extensions
coke is like a mattress in the hood , i'm flippin' on it
and the money's like a chair , i'm sittin' on it
i think i'm big meech , larry hoover
whippin' work , hallelujah
one nation , under god
