there's a field with angels movin' around me
i just worship thee , for all he's done for me
it's a new day , i have been born again
i've been born again , i've been born again
in his spirit , and his name , i'm sanctified !
lord i testify , he's right by my side
i believe it be , his word is so clear to me
yeah , yeah
all i want's a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
plus that paper chasin' , it done turn me to a savage
groupies in the lobby , they just tryna get established
god , i've been guilty , fornicatin' from my status
all i wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
plus that paper chasin' , it had turned me to a savage
groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established
god , i've been guilty , fornicatin' from my status
niggas be lovin' the old ye , they sayin' the new ye , that nigga be spazzin'
but when ali turn up and be ali , you can't ever change that nigga back to cassius
so you can gon' and make up lies , but i'm so sanctified
i don't sweat it , wipe my forehead with a handkerchief
and wash my sins in the blood of jesus ( ross grunt )
people sayin' , " ye we need another yeezus " ( ross grunt )
lames try to tell me , " cut the wildin' out , out "
but who the fuck is you reachin' ?

i can feel his blessings wash away my sins
i'm sanctified and , i have been born again
now i proclaim , hallowed be thy name
ohhh
all i want's a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
plus that paper chasin' , it done turn me to a savage
groupies in the lobby , they just tryna get established
god , i've been guilty , fornicatin' from my status
keys to my success , i get new keys and new address
bitches that i date don't get degrees but they can dress
fellatio's amazin' , make grilled cheese for you , the best
major cult figure , i'm the fresh david koresh
soldiers all in gators , new mercedes for cadets
balmain uniform , you know donda designed the vest
double m , that be the army , better yet , the navy
baby seen me in that wraith , wanna have my baby
all i wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
now i want two hundred and m√©nage in my palace
walkin' out the jeweler with no mothafuckin' balance
somewhere in jamaica i'm still holdin' on my chalice
rims on my ferrari , my bitch said that i was childish
'til i fuck a girl , that girl tweeted that i was stylish
when we fucked again , she told me " that was just some foul shit "
i walk into the room , you can even hear all the silence
i can feel his blessings wash away my sins
i'm sanctified and , i have been born again
now i proclaim , hallowed be thy name
ohhh
