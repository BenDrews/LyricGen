this is for the soldiers that see the sun at midnight , ya dig ?
let me slow down ( it’s so incredible )
i go to the grave before i be a bitch nigga
better behave , you dealing with some rich niggas
we the lost symbols speak in cryptic code
ancient wisdom valuable like gifts of gold
i embark on life , my path is all math
i understand the codes these hackers can’t crack
i understand that folks expect me to fold
community control to violate parole
i won't fail , but a lot of men will
i’m iconic in the field like solomon's seal
uh , it’s just the intro
allow my flow time to sink into the tempo
free mason , freelancer
free agents , we faster
big contracts , big contractors
built pyramids , period , we masters
no caterpillars , it was just a lot of niggas
a lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors
all white mansion , i’m the child of god
all black diamonds , times were hard
new rolls royce , guess you made it , nigga
all - white neighborhood , you they favorite nigga
my top back like jfk
they wanna push my top back like jfk
so , so i " jfk "
join forces with the kings and we ate all day
right now i could rewrite history
i stopped writing , so fuck it i’ll do it mentally
i go to the grave before i be a bitch nigga
better behave , you dealing with some rich niggas
started in the ghetto , now we worldwide
multiplying and i pray to god we never die
i go to the grave before i be a bitch nigga
better behave , you dealing with some rich niggas
started in the ghetto , now we worldwide
multiplying and i pray to god we never die
niggas couldn’t do nothing with me , they put the devil on me
i would have preferred niggas squeeze the metal on me
rumors of lucifer , i don’t know who to trust
whole world want my demise ; turn the music up
hear me clearly
if y’all niggas fear me just say y'all fear me
fuck all these fairy tales ; go to hell , this is god engineering
this is a hail mary pass , y’all interfering
he without sin shall cast the first stone
so y’all look in the mirror , double - check your appearance
bitch , i said i was amazing
not that i’m a mason
it’s amazing , that i made it through the maze that i was in
lord forgive me , i never would’ve made it without sin
holy water , my face in the basin
diamonds in my rosary shows he forgave him
bitch i’m red - hot , i’m on my 3rd 6 , but a devil i’m not
my jesus - piece flooded , but thou shall not covet
keep your eyes off my cupboard , i’m a bad motherfucker
it’s hov , just say you love it
i go to the grave before i be a bitch nigga
better behave , you dealing with some rich niggas
started in the ghetto , now we worldwide
multiplying and i pray to god we never die
i go to the grave before i be a bitch nigga
better behave , you dealing with some rich niggas
started in the ghetto , now we worldwide
multiplying and i pray to god we never die
if i ever die
never let it be said i didn’t win
never , never say
never say legend didn’t go in ( i'mma go in )
i just wanna die on top of the world
and making love to my favorite girl
i'm making beautiful music , we making a movie
we knew we was born to do it
i go to the grave before i be a bitch nigga
better behave , you dealing with some rich niggas
started in the ghetto , now we worldwide
multiplying and i pray to god we never die
i go to the grave before i be a bitch nigga
better behave , you dealing with some rich niggas
started in the ghetto , now we worldwide
multiplying and i pray to god we never die
