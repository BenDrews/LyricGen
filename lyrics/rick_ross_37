and i’m running straight up in the culo
my wrist always on frio , call me chilly chill
super head from superhead , and i really will
californication , motivation in my pocket
got on my blue dickie , shout out my nigga roccett
still smoking sticky , it ain't no other option
not for made niggas and i’m never stopping
i raised the bar , i set the standards

i say shout my driver lauren , that 62 with curtains
can't see shit , i don’t know where the fuck i’m at for certain
when it boils down , i’m just a t.o. nigga
but bitches tell me that i look just like a creole nigga

smoking bull riders , shit moving slow as a ballad
tattoo on your ass , it’d be nice if you show me
i’m buying bitches furs , mike tyson , naomi

michael jackson , let it moonwalk
set it on the napkin , let it cool off
