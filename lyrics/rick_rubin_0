how did you come to work on yeezus ?
kanye called me. i’d just finished working at the studio for about two months on another album , and i was getting ready to go away on vacation for a couple weeks. then he called up and said , “can i just come play my album ? ” and i said , “sure.” i always like to hear what he’s working on. so he came over to my house in malibu. we listened. i thought i was going to hear a finished album , but actually we listened to probably three and a half hours of works in progress.
what did the album sound like at that point ?
kind of meandering , unfocused , usually without his vocals. i assumed that the album was scheduled to come out next year. so i said , “when are you thinking of finishing up ? ” and he said , “it’s coming out in five weeks.” like completely confident and fine.
he wasn’t stressed.
not at all. i said , “i have a record coming out in november that’s a lot further along than this.” he said , “really ? what are you doing for the next five days ? ” i said i was going to go away. then he said , “please help me. would you be open to fixing it and shaping it and finishing it off ? ”
did he realize how much more work it needed ?
to me it seemed impossible what he was asking. i remember i wasn’t feeling that well that day , and i was thinking , is the music making me sick ? i don’t feel good about this. we ended up working probably 15 days , 16 days , long hours , no days off , 15 hours a day. i was panicked the whole time.
what was the process like during those 15 days ? how did you find a direction for the album ?
there was so much material we could really pick which direction it was going to go. the idea of making it edgy and minimal and hard was kanye’s. i’d say , “this song is not so good. should i start messing with it ? can i make it better ? ” and he’d say , “yes , but instead of adding stuff , try taking stuff away.” we talked a lot about minimalism. my house is basically an empty white box. when he walked in , he was like , “my house is an empty white box , too ! ”
it’s a good thing you were on the same wavelength , because the sheer logistics of finishing the album must have been daunting.

the thing is , when you’re a fan from the outside of something , you can embrace it in a different way than when you’re a fan from the inside. run - d.m.c. could be sort of gangstery in their own way , pre - gangster rap , because they were suburban kids. kurtis blow , who was from harlem and really around gangsters , he didn’t want to be a gangster. he wanted to look above it and wear leather boots and be more like a rock star. grandmaster flash and the furious five were really inner - city , hard - life guys , and they wanted to be from outer space.
so you go to nyu. you start a little label called def jam out of your dorm room. your first single , “it’s yours” by t la rock and jazzy jay , is a big underground hit. then russell simmons seeks you out and you team up.
when i met russell , he was shocked that i was white. shocked. because i had made this single he really loved.
your debut release together on def jam was “i need a beat” by ll cool j. this was 1984. when you first heard ll , what was your reaction ?
i laughed because he sounded really young. he was 16 , and he was using all these big words. but he sounded like he knew what he was talking about.

so you don’t believe that , say , a great melody is necessarily part of a great song ?
no , no. i think one of the things that really drew me to hip - hop was how you could get to this very minimal essence of a song—to a point where many people wouldn’t call it a song. my first credit was “reduced by rick rubin.” that was on ll cool j’s debut album , radio. the goal was to be just vocals , a drum machine , and a little scratching. there’s very little going on.
why was that so important to you ?
there’s a tremendous power in using the least amount of information to get a point across.

were the beastie boys similar to ll cool j , or did they have a sense of rap as pop songs , with choruses and everything ?
not really. the majority of the music i did , and then we wrote a lot of the lyrics together. often adam and i would go out at night , to danceteria , and just exchange ideas. i can remember we wrote the song “girls” on the train to washington , d.c. we started with the idea of what the song would be. it was rooted in the isley brothers’ “shout.” what would a rap version of “shout” sound like ? and if you listen to it now , you’ll see it’s really similar.

you also produced the red hot chili peppers’ blood sugar sex magik. it was a transitional moment for them. tell me about the genesis of “under the bridge.”
same as the ll story. i was at anthony’s house , and he was showing me some books of writing he had done. and i was going through the notebooks and i found this “under the bridge” thing. and i was like , “this looks really good. what is this ? ” and anthony’s like , “well , it’s a poem , and a song , but it’s not a chili peppers song.” and i was like , “why not ? ” and he’s like , “well , that’s not what we do. we’re a funk band and i rap , and this isn’t that kind of song. this is more of a personal song.” but i pushed him. i said , “let’s just explore where it goes.”
why did you push ?

on our first album , there was a song he wrote , i can’t remember which one it was , but i listened to it and said , “do you think you could take some of the ‘i’s and ‘me’s out of it ? ” and he thought about it and he was like , “yeah , i think i can do that.” and he did. so 10 years later , i’m visiting him in nashville. he’s in a wheelchair. he’s blind , pretty much. it felt so awkward. so i said , “what have you been working on lately ? ” and he said , “i’ve been working on using ‘i’ and ‘me’ less.” and i said , “really ? ” and he said , “yeah. remember ? you gave me that comment on the song ? that’s what i’ve been working on.” incredible. he didn’t mean it in the context of songs. he meant it in the context of life.

your taste—your ear—has been spot - on again and again , across genres. what’s the secret ?
i never decide if an idea is good or bad until i try it. so much of what gets in the way of things being good is thinking that we know. and the more that we can remove any baggage we’re carrying with us , and just be in the moment , use our ears , and pay attention to what’s happening , and just listen to the inner voice that directs us , the better. but it’s not the voice in your head. it’s a different voice. it’s not intellect. it’s not a brain function. it’s a body function , like running from a tiger.
instinct.
yes. but being open to using your instincts instead of going , “oh , that’s not going to work.” or listening to the part of your brain that goes , “oh , that’s out of tune.” or the part of your brain that says , “that’s too loud.” you have to shut off all of those voices and look for these special moments—these moments that you accept you have no control over. so much of my job is to not think—to be open to what’s there , and then use my intuition to see where it takes me.
