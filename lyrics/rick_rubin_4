last chance to make believe in always and all it seems
train wrecks hide underneath your umbrella
set the frame destiny on this first name soliloquy
tired symphonies play downward
let me give the world to you my love
let me give the world to you my love
let me show you what i'm thinking of
let me give the world to you my love
so far
so far
so far
lovers form dead excuse
and blur the line with soul abuse
my lonesome lines just have no use around here
new skin may hold you in
but the old skin still turns us on
flicker fades the nitrate dawn to wear
let me give the world to you my love
let me show you what i'm thinking of
times are hard and we're the last in line
cause in my grief i'd forgotten what was mine
no i wouldn't change a thing
no i , no
no i wouldn't change a thing about the way you are
the distance here , the speed so far
so far
so far
so far
let me give the world to you , my love
let me give the world to you
so far
so far
so far
