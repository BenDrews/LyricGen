before day break there were none
and as it broke there was one
the moon , the sun , it goes on'n'on
the winter better was warm
the summer children were born
and so the story goes on'n'on
come women if your life beats
those we buried with the house keys
smoke and feather where the fields are
green from here to eternity
come woman on your own time
far far far from the virgin vine
rising out from the dead leaves
come back to me
oh sing your favorite song
left to tears
dreams it goes and then on
a vessel in the bloodline
the 13th zodiac sign
a stitch in time it goes on'n'on
someday the grapes will be wine
someday you will be mine
and so the story goes on'n'on
come women if your life beats
those we buried with the house keys
smoke and feather where the fields are
green from here to eternity
come woman on your own time
far far far from the virgin vine
rising out from the dead leaves
come back to me
oh sing your favorite song
left to tears
dreams it goes and then on
oh sing your favorite song
left to tears
dreams it goes and then on
