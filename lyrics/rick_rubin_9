ambiance
survived the holocaust , mozel tav
mano a mano turn you to a man with my monologue
so much nights my advice was to use vices as tylenol
do no insult
sweet lifeline , throw your dab of salt
respond with a jab like javelin
judgin' me , give a gravel pit to your gavel dawg
nastradamus playin possum ya'll
addicted to the life , i ain't got withdrawals
not involved if you can't evolve
not involved if you can't evolve
sick of routines but only got halls and a hallmark card
thoughts crane kick while the jet leaves
accept me or exempt me now
john wilkes booth the booth with a new hit
exodus for tryna ex me out
you can't take my power
do you know who you talkin' to ?
you can't take my power
do you know who you talkin' to ?
i don't think you know who you talkin' to
they diss from a distance
ain't brainstorm if sky's your limits ( ooohhhhh )
got the prize with my eye all in it ( ooooohhhh )
tidal waves these lames until my title's claimed
100 miles a minute ( ooohhhhh )
usually calm , now calamity
used to be in bliss , now in sanity
stop the famine for my family
but even your fam'll lie , where's the masterpiece ?
we had masters too , what a tragedy
try to blow me out the water but a fan of me ?
you ain't never felt the wrath of me
you ain't never felt the wrath of me
you ain't never felt the wrath of me
what you scared of ? thinking of retirement
dying before they recognize i'm a diamond
pulitzer prize winner with a pistol spittin' author
3 minute song turn ny into sparta
you can't take my power
do you know who you talkin' to ?
you can't take my power
do you know who you talkin to ?
you can't take my power mothafucker
i fell from the sky last night
but now i'm feeling high again
( you can't handle this power )
shook so much hands last night
old friends wanna say " hi " again
music hits us in a really emotional way
for me it took me away in a way nothing else could
it's just got a tremendous power
do you know who you talkin' to ?
rick rubin on rubin's dorm floors
came up in the building
yeah it been a minute
killin' niggas independent though
i love kitties and your titties though
she a pop , she a pretty hoe
now i'm racing for a pot of gold
piffy found it on a pretty stove
i ain't broke , funds is really low
everybody been through this before
i don't gotta worry , i just gotta hurry , get it all never minimum
now i'm on they be feeling him

i was wildin' every day in school
couldn't tell me nothing , fuck the rules
shaq pullin' out the tools , jay pullin' out the tools
take your time to get your recognize your blessings
i been killin' dressing since the age of seven
age of nine i was really reppin'
age twelve i'm a living legend
now a nigga feeling well invested
everybody seem to get the message
everybody want an illa lesson
you can't take my power

( my power , my power , this my power )
you can't take my power

( you can't stop my power , my power , this my power )
you can't take my
you can't , you can't take my
you can't , you can't take my
smoke holes all in my garments
the mojo comes from 44 sumner houses
actin' like my best friend wasn’t just now homeless
my back still hurt from sleepin' on those carpets
back when i ain't even even have a dollar for free food
back when i thought that it was cooler to be you
back when it was only quarter waters , call of duty every corner
call illa , need more fingers for the rings soon
felt power letting go of my goal list
i’m a hustler , make gold out of goldfish
i ain't even even got a 100 thousand yet
but a 100 million mothafuckers showing me respect
my top 5 rhymers all food when the time’s right
seen bros ignore blood for the limelight
funny how my foresight is like hindsight
'fore i started stacking , made sure that the mind right airtight rhyme like
hands on the stove for the heat through a soundbite
you downright down being down through the down nights
downsize all the outliers
freestyle the verse cause god the ghostwriter
lie detector test all the shit i spoke
doubting ? must be literally shit you smoke
pray you recognize you a king soon
through all your hatin' still gon' forgive you
power
