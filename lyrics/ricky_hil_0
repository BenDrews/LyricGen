she'll be alone when i leave her
i like it better that way
i'm on my own when i need her
cause they could dead her that way
she's addicted to the heroin
lighter than a feather that day
but i kind of like the morphine
triple x double bottle , lean codeine
what you want ?
i'm that motherfucker
baby , i'm that motherfucker
what you on ?
nothing like them other suckers
nothing like them other suckers
mrs. lucille
come and touch me
let me know that you're real
because if you're fake
i got to get away
punch you in the fucking face
should have known from the start
what we got can't leave this room
and i ain't playing with your heart
it's just a habit to let bitches know the truth
i made it clear to the world
ain't nobody gonna be that somebody
i made it clear to the world
ain't nobody gonna be that somebody
i do it all to stay warm
i do it all to get by
i do it all for a home
for a night
but , baby
i won't keep ya
just know that
i'mma leave ya
so , fuck me right
baby , fuck me right
until i'm too tired to leave ya
and we can
call this your night
wipe those tears from your eyes
cause , baby it's alright
baby it's alright
i got a bottle of the 'tron
in my brand new coat
if you want to take a sip
to forget what we did
girl , i've done this before
i get faded all alone
'til my body gets thin
to forget all my sins
