verse 1
she comes by herself , brings us our gifts
it's hard to tell , she leaves so swift
she don't love you , she don't love me
whoever she loves , that man must be free
i don't know , maybe you do
what she be thinking , when she looks at you
she sits on the floor , looks at the movie
she gets high too , this girl is groovy
i don't wanna , make you run
from all of us , we just have fun
and we touch ya , but you don't let us fuck ya
she has good intentions , it's obvious to see
but who is this girl , why can't we see
what she would do , behind closed doors
with you or with me
why can't we see !
hook
sarah , you like to keep me wondering
sarah , you know you keep us wondering ,
verse 2
she's sexy as she sounds
with her pretty little mouth
and she likes to help around
with little things in the house
i wanna do things to her mouth
she swear that ain't what she bout
i start to doubt , i start to figure her out
sometimes i get to see your sister
and i touched her , but i...i didn't get to fuck her , ( or kiss her )
don't you know that we talk about you
me and my brothers want a...a piece of you
whoa , pretty brown hair , how long do you plan on staying here
she brought us drinks and food , she ain't never rude
can we share this woman , it would be wrong to keep her
tell me why she wouldn't , can't she see that we need her
hook
sarah , you like to keep me wondering
sarah , you know you keep us wondering
