it's getting late , i'm bout to miss my show
where the fuck did you go
on this day that i'm leaving you , and i told you so
so she grabs my face , looks in my eyes
asks me if i got high last night , but i didn't
i was smoking on weed , she was talking about the other kind
something knocks at the door , and i leave forever
she wanna lay with me , trying stay with me
i'm dying now , i'm dying now
my hands shaking a lot
i've been smoking a lot
and i ain't been making a lot
my hands shaking a lot
i've been smoking a lot
and i ain't been making a lot
xanax bars ain't making it stop
xanax bars ain't making it stop
and i know i'm gonna leave someday , but it ain't today
you see me i'm kind of off , a little slurred when i talk
and them people in the street they be starring when i walk
go ahead mr. businessman
you can't dress like me
yeah
if i let a bitch breathe , she'll get ahead of me
find another muthafucka , that she think way better than me
let's hope you're embedded in me , cause i'm gone for good
i'm a see about a view things , ricky misunderstood
i'm dying now , i'm dying now
