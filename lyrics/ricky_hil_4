i think i can fix you...
i am lost , can't find my way
you were gone , when im awake
( if youâ€™re there , i will feel for you )
i just need to numb the pain
will you fix me , will you show me how to breathe
before all is gone and all my hope is lost , baby
will you fix me , will you give me what i need
i love you
when im lost , can't find my way
and when it's lost , it finds me someway
and when im gone , im gone away
and when its gone , its gone a ways
i never knew that but i think i know now
ill never get back what i use to throw out
im alone and it's real but i don't know now
my heart is all my i have and my brains wearing out
will you fix me , will you show me how to breathe
before all is gone and all my hope is lost , baby
will you fix me , will you give me what i need
i love you
oh oh a oh oh oh oh
