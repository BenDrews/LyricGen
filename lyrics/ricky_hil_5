verse 1 ( ricky hil )
by the time i woke up , she was already gone
how can you love me , if i'm alone
here i go on a road i never been on
and i'm leaving you for everything you did wrong
i don't wanna go back to that same place
replay memories that i erased
it's too bad , i'm irate
i've been getting real high at a high rate
my mom said she coming this friday
until then im'a fly away
i don't want her to see me like i am now
this is nostra , this is devil's playground
pop a pill , play around take her down
until shes making sounds
i usually stay around
a couple pounds and some lean
a couple nightmares and some dreams
it ain't what it seems
( chorus )
i know , you can't understand me
and i don't really care
if you can't stand me
two grams in my l , a bitch in my bed
i'll prolly go to hell , won't be with you instead
for my ex if she wishing me well
you can listen and tell
verse 2 ( boo bonic )
aye i can't help it that sometime i get a chick
but like her friend , better
how i'm doing , i've been better
enough said , thin letter
can't help who you fuck with
can't choose who you stuck with
like huh who she come from
wonder who i end up with
my homies think it's fly yeah
me too but it jam though
always get a little tricky
when you fuck the fam though
oh , that's fucked up
i pray no karma
incase im draped in armor
plus both are nice , fuck on the other hand though
pop that , got ammo
she a soldier , i'm in camo
a range of bad bitches , but they boxed in like
land rov - er , did it occur , i'm that nigga
fuck with her , keep shit 1 , zero zero per
add that cent , bitch is you bent , huh
( chorus )
i know , you can't understand me
and i don't really care
if you can't stand me
two grams in my l , a bitch in my bed
prolly go to hell , won't be with you instead
from my ex if she wishing me well
you can listen and tell
verse 3 ( ricky hil )
it's dark out by the time i step out
i'm really losing it now
pain pills sleeping pills and tussin
i've been abusing it now
and you don't know , how i've died
a million times , by your side
and if we try , and if we lose
how will i fight , past the bruise
baby i know , that you're loose
baby i know what to do with you
you don't even know what to do with me
every pretty broad had their way with me
baby i'm thin , running thin here i go again
if they even really know
they'd let a mutha fucka in
( chorus )
i know , you can't understand me
and i don't really care
if you can't stand me
two grams in my l , a bitch in my bed
prolly go to hell , won't be with you instead
from my ex if she wishing me well
you can listen and tell
