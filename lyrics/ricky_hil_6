are you always this beautiful when your sad , you say
what we got now , is nothing like we had
ive been having withdrawals , and they've been getting bad
y'all been gone and i miss y'all , it's making me sad
pop it light it sip it pass it never tell her that you have it
kiss her fuck her miss her but you never tell her that you love her ,
where have you been , i've been over here , waiting on my own
they don't know what's lonely mamma , but i know they know the tone
i'm looking at the walls , hoping that they'll fall , or just close in
i'm talking to myself , i'm talking to the doors , i don't know them
they could have their way with me , anytime they want
but they never want to lay with me , at the times that im alone
oh oh oh oh oh
are you always this beautiful when your sad , you say
what we got now , is nothing like we had
ive been having withdraws , and they've been getting bad
y'all been gone and i miss y'all , it's making me sad
the frame of the mind that im in can't be safe ,
if you'll let me know what you know
i won't be this way
you never told me that you love me as many times i told you
and i've been alone i see your face and i don't know you
so where have you been , all this drug abuse making me thin
and that ain't me , and that ain't who i saw myself to be
and im running low , i bought it in the row
the person that sold it to me said it make me cold
i want you to know , if it was just different
then i would of tried to lifted your vision but ahh
are you always this beautiful when your sad , you say
what we got now , is nothing like we had
ive been having withdraws , and they've been getting bad
y'all been gone and i miss y'all , it's making me sad
