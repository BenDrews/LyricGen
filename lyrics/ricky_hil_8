welcome to slickville , yeah
all my tears start are in a wishing well
i gave her cocaine and x pills
but she just wanted heroin and hil
so i gave myself to her
cold is rushing through my veins , and today i don't feel no pain
i know you don't know my name , but we be going places and we feel the same
but you don't be leaning like i am , and how i stand , rebel man
down for whatever man , down for whatever man , rebel man
if i ain't there , tomorrow , just know that i've lived , with sorrow
mary told me that she dying , i said i can't be with you right now but i'm crying
d o p e in her veins , sounds a rain by the window pane
she feels pains i feel pain , ain't it funny
that she hate sniffing cocaine , wrote a letter to her mother
told her that i love her , never find another and i hate to see her suffer
now you know that i've never been this close
you know , that i've never had that dose
you know that we could be alone forever , but you don't take advantage of that when we together
now i put the flower on marys grave and a little small baggy
coz she loves fine beige , i love that bitch , and she love me too
she in peace looking down on you
welcome to slickville , all our skys are gray , just watch the children play
