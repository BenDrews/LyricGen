i can't stand
you can't stay
i'll be just as gone tomorrow
as i was today
you don't know that it
breaks me down
everybody just staring me down
but i don't care
i still ain't there
i take my chances
i look at fear
burning down bridges
fucking with these girls
all i got in this world
sippin' on 'tussin
smokin' on ls
all i got in this world
and everybody's breaking me down
but i'm okay
they don't understand
i had a motherfucking plan
i'm around
you're away
i can see your smile
but i can't feel my face
and you don't know that
i'm dying for you
everything that i'm trying for you
and everybody's breakin' me down
but i'm okay
they don't understand
i had a motherfucking plan
mary got some fuckin problems
and she think that them pills gonna solve em
jamie , she be on that heroin
and i told her you my bitch but you a motherfucking junky
and i take morphine daily and i smoke weed daily
mother mary don't fail me
money... money
