stone face dog , swirling fog
gates open on the dark , dark night
standing stone , skull and bone
dead witness to an unseen fight
beat the drum , beat the drum
beat forever on the endless march
stricken dumb , cut and run
someone is screaming and the sky is dark
sword and shield , bone and steel
rictus grin
deaf forever to the battle's din
deaf forever to the battle's din
march or cloak , flame and smoke
burn forever in eternal pain
charge and fall , bugle call
bone splinter in the driving rain
horses scream , viking dream
drowned heroes in a lake of blood
armoured fist , severed wrist
broken spears in a sea of mud
deaf forever
stone dead forever
mother earth , mother earth
enfold you in her cold embrace
sinking down , killing ground
worm crawling on your cold white face
win or lose , naught to choose
all men are equal when their memory fades
no - one knows , friends or foes
if valhalla lies beyond the grave
deaf forever to the battle's din
deaf forever to the battle's din
