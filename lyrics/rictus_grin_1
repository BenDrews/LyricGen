it’s everything , what’s wrong with it ?
it’s everything , what’s wrong with us ?
null , rictus grin , beyond death
and it’s after
me , so insane , suzerain
and he’s calling
nothing is over , nothing is over , nothing is over , nothing is over
come see , with me as everything turns
nothing is over , nothing is over , nothing is solved it only starts over
you’ll see with me as everything burns
what comes after
what comes after me
a history , of love and pain
in this story it’s all the same
void , rictus grin , stand in sin
rule the rulers
blood , on the plains , suzerain
and he’s screaming
you’ll see with me as everything burns
nothing is over , nothing is over , nothing is over , nothing is over
i’ll be set free , free from this memory
what comes after
what comes after me
nothing is over , nothing is over
you’ll see with me as everything burns
nothing is over , nothing is over , nothing is over , nothing is over
i’ll be set free , free from this memory
what comes after , what comes after me
