i'm just a decent lyricist , who had a peak experience
now i think in circles , and speak in pyramids
two thousand six , same shit , different century
killing me how people still believe the myth of entropy
write my own equations , spiral spoken language
rapping session backwoods legend , broke and famous
drop a random flow that burns a perfect mandelbrot
crop sign , then i drop rhymes for the fans at home
lately i've been tripping off the math that i see
patterns in trees , everything is fractals to me
i live with the proof you go broke spitting the truth
i'm finished with dudes debating who's sicker than who
that punchline shit is honestly pathetic
i drop it without pausing for the audience to get it
thank god for quality pot , dudes who deliver the goods
watching the crop cuz they live in the woods
the naked ape with the wake and bake ritual
pack an eighth a day , spit razor blade syllables
it's not true till it hurts , so i refused to rehearse
got blazed onstage , started doing my verse , it went...
second nature - - - three shots , and then a chaser
waited twenty minutes , then i grabbed the pen and paper
rock a rictus grin with a twist of gin
to loosen up the lizard skin that i exist within
usually buzzed , and when i'm doing some drugs
i'm stupid enough to wake up in a cruiser with cuffs
around the bend , lost contact with a thousand friends
practiced mountain zen , but that shit's about to end...
we bring the funk , spitting up something hicks can bump
on the backroads , getting mad stoned and liqoured up
until your liver busts , switch it up to different drugs
it's the soundtrack to crashing your dad's pickup truck
if i start at the beginning and i end it when it's finished
can i explain the universe in less than seven minutes ?
dig it...i was born obsessed with dinosaurs and outer space
and that's the reason that i'm speaking how i sound today
before i see inside the back of my head
there's a lotta fact and events that probably have to be said
but fuck it : the track's in motion , crack it open
lay my brain on the table and try to map the ocean
my frontal lobes roll every drunken show
where i'd bust a flow , puke outside , stumble home
memory gaps , too much missing , never relaxed
not knowing if i settled all my debts with the past
jaw tension , freestyle tapes , lost sessions
fallen angels , caught messing with god's weapons ( whoops )
life is different now , i used to be a kid with doubts
denied the visions and blocked the signals out
lost connection in all directions
and forgot each breath has been a pretty awesome blessing
it's all perception , a million mixed messages
keep your mind moving and your fingertips sensitive
if i start at the beginning and i end it when it's finished
can i explain the universe in less than seven minutes ?
dig it...i was born obsessed with dinosaurs and outer space
and that's the reason that i'm speaking how i sound today
grew up sleeping late , reading strange comic books
so every time i let my mind go , my mom was shook
and now today , i found a way to twist the digits back
if you don't see it , so be it , i can live with that...
