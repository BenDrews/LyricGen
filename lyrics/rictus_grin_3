the jokes are everywhere
the secret deal's complete –
money talks , some good advice
the politicians run like clockwork mice
all fits the masterplan
a database on the telephone
and cable sunshine floods your home –
so , times are good ?
fat cats get fatter day by day
those who sit it out will make their way
so things can't be that bad
ooh , a smile has set upon this land
ooh , a selfish grin of ignorance ;
ooh , you simply have to play the game
the joke's on us :
this is more and more ridiculous
everything's great
objectivity taboo ;
self - satisfaction pumping up
minor achievements to cover up
all the failures and mistakes
and if you don't smile along
you're a public enemy , you don't belong...
the black lists are in the mail
there isn't any room for doubt
we'll all be equal when we share it out
but outsiders will get nothing
ooh , a smile has set upon this land
ooh , a rictus grin of ignorance ;
ooh , you simply have to play the game
the joke's on us :
this is more and more ridiculous
