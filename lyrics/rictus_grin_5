from whence you came
the prince of this world
wanderer on a path of shame
stand proud , wings unfurled
fire , burning all things that you love
and you get no help from above
pain becomes a friend and all truths turn to lies
fire , burning all things that you love
still you get no help from above
flame becomes a friend and you ́re the brightest
in the sky
eyes that burn with emerald fire
radiating a corpulent sheen
skull aflame , features running
weeping like wax from a candle
flame melts the obscene
drop by drop it sinks
a bath in a sea of green
embalmed with poison drinks
fire , burning all things that you love
and you get no help from above
pain becomes a friend and all truths turn to lies
fire , burning all things that you love
still you get no help from above
flame becomes a friend and you ́re the brightest
in the sky
twisted by the rictus grin
fading to death fugue of opaline
oh , bright and morning star
son of dawn , fallen afar
brought down to the realm of the dead
in to a fathomless pit , burnt and bled
when you rise , we will rise with you
when you sing , the world sings too
when the shackles break and come undone
when the battle for the kingdom is won
you are the brightest in the sky
