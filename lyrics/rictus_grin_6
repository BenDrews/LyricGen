i came to rest beside a placid lake
i'd run all night , and then i had to stop
at daybreak , when my strength had given out
awearily down to my knees i sank
fear crippled me and darkness i foresaw
yet faint i was , too powerless to rise
alas , sick fascination forced my eyes
to look into the dark , enthralling deeps
there did i see a thing , a pallid face
that stared at me with horrid , rictus grin
cold eyes and sneering maw , it ghastly lurked
i felt it was inhuman , felt its wrath
of course i knew this beast , i knew it well
â€“ it was the very one that i had fled
it beckoned me and i held out my hand...
lake's surface rippled once and then stood still
