deep down underneath the ground
in chambers clotted with the rotting dead
steaming vats filled with vampire bats
tanis root , and decaying heads
the potion made , we disseminate
spiking thousands of liters of grog
numbskull to inebriate
sends you into a heavy metal fog
( gang ) i am a numbskull !
i bang heads
moshing in the graveyard and defiling the dead
( gang ) i am a numbskull !
i twist brains
thrashing 'til we drive you insane
on a cold night in the local pub
an alliance was put to the forge
f.k.u was there with lord gore and frightmare
machetazo , haemmorhage , and engorged
we all toasted with some numbskull
" here's to waging a metal war ! "
the chalices emptied , we took to the stage
to carry out our declaration of gore
( gang ) i am a numbskull !
i drink deep
rot gut consumed by a quartet of creeps
( gang ) i am a numbskull !
i infect
drink up , it's time to snap necks
the crowd was amassed at the edge of the pit
timidly cringing so as not to get hit
the numbskull started kicking in as the bodies were flying through the air
a rictus grin on each face in the crowd , coupled with a psychotic stare
their skin decayed and fell off in lumps
and hair came out in greasy clumps
their blood coagulated in their veins
as deafening thrash riffs tore apart their brains
zombified in the pit , gore addicted misfits
the first band was backstage , they came out and got slayed
devoured by the undead , gutted and splattered
unique leader catalogs were torn up , burned , and scattered
( gang chant ) numbskull !
the show ended in a bloodbath
but nothing dead shall truly dead remain
the doors were opened to release the numbskulls
so they'll infect every poser's brain
i am a numbskull !
i'm unhinged
murdering and moshing as on rot gut we binge
i am a numbskull !
i am you
'cuz you're a fucking numbskull too
