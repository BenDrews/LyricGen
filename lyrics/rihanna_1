mustard on the beat ho !
i was good on my own
that's the way it was
that's the way it was
you was good on the low
for a faded fuck
on some faded love
shit , what the fuck you complaining for ?
feeling jaded , huh ?
used to trip off that shit i was kickin' to you
had some fun on the run though i'll give it to you
but baby , don't get it twisted
you was just another nigga on the hit list
tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
didn't they tell you that i was a savage ?
fuck ya white horse and ya carriage
bet you never could imagine
never told you you could have it
you needed me
oooh , you needed me
to feel a little more , and give a little less
know you hate to confess
but baby ooo , you needed me
you been rollin' around , shit i'm rollin' up
light and roll it up
break it down , like a pound , shit was never us
shit was never us
that's the real , on the real , are you serious ?
how you feel , how you feel ?
used to trip off that shit i was kickin' to ya
had some fun on the run though , i give it to ya
but baby , don't get it twisted
you was just another nigga on the hit list
tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
didn't they tell you that i was a savage ?

oooh , you needed me
to feel a little more , and give a little less
