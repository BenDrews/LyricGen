all along it was a fever
a cold sweat , hot - headed believer
i threw my hands in the air , said show me something
he said , " if you dare come a little closer
round and around and around and around we go
oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know "
not really sure how to feel about it
something in the way you move
makes me feel like i can't live without you
and it takes me all the way
i want you to stay
it's not much of a life you're living
it's not just something you take , it's given
round and around and around and around we go
oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
not really sure how to feel about it
something in the way you move
makes me feel like i can't live without you
and it takes me all the way
i want you to stay
the reason i hold on
cause i need this hole gone
funny you're the broken one
but i'm the only one who needed saving
cause when you never see the light
it's hard to know which one of us is caving
not really sure how to feel about it
something in the way you move
makes me feel like i can't live without you
and it takes me all the way
i want you to stay
stay
i want you to stay
ooh
