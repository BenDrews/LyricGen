i came fluttering in from neverland
time can never stop me , no , no , no , no
i know you've tried to
i came riding in on a pale white horse
handing out highs to less fortunate
i do advise you
run it back , run it on back
when you breaking it down for me
cause i can't hear you , two times
run it on back , will it ever make sense to me ?
i got to do things my own way darling
will you ever let me
will you ever respect me ? no
do things my own way darling
you should just let me
why you ain't ever let me grow ?
when i look outside my window
i can't get no piece of mind
when i look outside my window
i can't get no peace of mind
let me cover your shit in glitter
i could make it gold , gold
heard you tryna sell your soul , baby
word on the street , you run it low lately
i needed you to please give my reflection a break
from the face it’s seeing now
ooh darling , gahhlee
would you mind giving my reflection a break
from the pain it’s feeling now ?
i got to do things my own way darling
you should just let me
will you ever respect me ? no
do things my own way darling
you should just let me
why you ain't ever let me grow ?
when i look outside my window
i can't get no piece of mind
when i look outside my window
i can't get no peace of mind
get no piece
get no peace
get , get , getting no peace
can't get no peace
( get , g - g - get no peace oh )
