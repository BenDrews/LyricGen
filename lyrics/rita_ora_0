baby , let's cut down the lights
i just really wanna let this fire burn bright
i'm just telling you to have an open mind
just imagine us
you're taking me there , you're taking me there
our lips are barely touching
so do it again , so do it again
we could be on to something
heyo , heyo , i just wanna feel your body on me
heyo , heyo , if you want it then you got it , hold me
no more , no more wasting time
we can , we can go all night
heyo , heyo , i just wanna feel your body on me
ayayayayayayayayaya
body on me
ayayayayayayayayaya

put you up against the wall
and i'ma go to work 'til you get off
baby , soon as you're done we'll go some more
girl , just imagine us
you're taking me there , you're taking me there
our lips are barely touching
so do it again , so do it again
we could be on to something
heyo , heyo , i just wanna feel your body on me
heyo , heyo , if you want it then you got it , hold me
no more , no more wasting time
we can , we can go all night
heyo , heyo , i just wanna feel your body on me

us , only nobody has to know what's going down right now baby
heyo , heyo , i just wanna feel your body on me
heyo , heyo , if you want it then you got it , hold me
no more , no more wasting time
we can , we can go all night
heyo , heyo , i just wanna feel your body on me
