i could have beer for breakfast , my sanity for lunch
tryin' to get over how bad i want you so much
innocence for dinner , pour somethin' in my cup
anything and everything just to fill me up
but nothing ever gets me high like this
i picked my poison and it's you
nothing can kill me like you do
you're goin' straight to my head
and i'm headin' straight for the edge
i picked my poison and it's you
i picked my poison and it's you
i can feel your whisper and layin' on the floor
i tried to stop , but i keep on comin' back for more
i'm a lightweight and i know it
cause after the first time i was fallin' , fallin' down
but nothing ever gets me high like this
i picked my poison and it's you
nothing can kill me like you do
you're goin' straight to my head
and i'm headin' straight for the edge
i picked my poison and it's you
i picked my poison and it's you
i love bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
fallin' deep , i can sleep tonight
and you make me feel like i'm out of my mind
but it's alright , it's alright , it's alright
bittersweet ecstasy that you got me in
fallin' deep , i can sleep tonight
and you make me feel like i'm out of my mind
but it's alright , it's alright , it's alright
nothing ever gets me high like this
i picked my poison and it's you
nothing can kill me like you do
you're goin' straight to my head
and i'm headin' straight for the edge
i pick my poison and it's you
( ohh it's you )
i pick my poison and it's you
and it's you
yeah , yeah , yeah
i pick my poison and it's you
