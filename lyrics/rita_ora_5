i stumbled up to the window
opened the curtains to blinding light
make up all over the pillow
what went on ? what went on ?
what went on last night ?
you look so sweet while you're dreaming ( yeah )
holding your bottle of tanqueray ( yeah )
it isn't even the weekend
baby , that's how i know you're the one for me
i wanna party and bullshit
and party and bullshit

and party , and party
cause when the sun sets baby
on the avenue
i get that drunk sex feeling
yeah , when i'm with you
so put your arms around me , baby
we're tearing up the town
cause that's just how we do
we got that sweet , hot loving
dancing in the dark
out in the streets we're running
shut down every bar
so put your arms around me , baby
we're tearing up the town
cause that's just how we do
how we do , that's just how we do
how we do , that's just how we do
hungover , i think i'm broken
you said the fix is a shot of jack
i said , " man , what are you smoking ? "
but alright , pour a glass , and we'll throw 'em back
