i've got sunshine in my pocket , i'm just right here in my zone
i've got sade in my tape deck , i'm just movin' right along
all these haters really love me , they just pretend that they don't
cause i've got sunshine in my pocket , i'm just right here in my zone
in my zone
zo - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh , oh
in my zone , zo - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh , oh
in my zone , zo - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh , oh
when i'm in my , when i'm in my
zo - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh , oh - in my zone
in my old school bumpin' that " kiss of life " beneath the city lights
caught up in the moment , getting misty eyed
bout to give my past life a long kiss goodnight
this dream difficult for me to visualize
and now it's real and they say the limit is the sky
but my feet set on solid ground , no more stalling now
on the road to get it cause , when it rained , it poured
but now the storms finally calming down
up in my cutlass driving , the sun is shining
my strange piece studded with a ton of diamonds
i ain't got a bunch of money on a constant grind
still it beats being blunted with my stomach growlin'
in the darkest alley , got the heart to fight
i see the stars are bright , they screaming jonny valiant
rappers wanna bite me , they crocodiling
i be up in neiman marcus smiling
try to walk a mile inside my j's , playing make believe
you can say that you played in the major league
wear my heart on my sleeve on the stage and leave
i feel wet from the sweat on my famous tee
i'm never scared , fuck shaking like a maple leaf
cause what awaits for me is unknown
so i lit up my j , filled my cid - up with straight
crown royal , now i'm in my zone
this ain't no ordinary love
i was sick of being poor and said " enough "
right up 85 north and there i was
working , breaking down doors and barriers
still representing georgia , i'm feeling the support
spread the word cause the more , the merrier
nobody blowing out the torch i carry
i ignore them every time they point and stare and judge
all because i got jordans on , i got a gorgeous blonde
and my jewelry blinds , i got stupid style
getting' paid doing music now , i'm putting' huge amounts
inside a few accounts , i got a crew that's down
in case you wanna come and duke it out
if i was you , i'd throw the deuce and bounce
and we just blew an ounce
my hotel room looking like a hookah lounge
i'm blowing up like a bazooka round
i got booed and bowed but stayed positive
even when i didn't have a pot to piss in
i was sitting on a bottle steady plotting this
and i'll be fine dining at the optimist
i got the black sea bass and the lobster bisque
and took a shot of whiskey to the dome
made a toast to the homies that are gone
two for the fans and the love they shown , i'm in my... zone
my calendar at this caliber's for the life of a bachelor
i'm burning through cannabis canister after canister
um , so many cameras , they flashing , i never glance at 'em
lost inside of a landfill of thoughts while watching this dancer
i'm wondering to myself if she's got some booty enhancer
either way , i feel the deep inclination of putting my hands on her
i'm a modern day galileo who lives in atlanta
the capital of the ratchets , aristocrats and traffickers
a practitioner , practice until i master it
passionate 'bout my adjectives , syllables so elaborate
anything less to describe me is just inaccurate
you're a student of classes in which i am a graduate
immaculate vernacular , batmobile look like dracula
giving these boys the blues while telling these hoes to saddle up
you catching feelings , i think you squarer than madison , i'm -
i'm in my zone , ain't no way i'll ever snap out of it
zo - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh , oh , in my zone
zo - oh - oh - oh , oh , oh , oh , in my zone
