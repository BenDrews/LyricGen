yeah , my god , my god , i’m odd , i’m strange
tech want me to kill em , give me a time frame
and point em out i'll gun em down yelling " die lame "
let the wet blood spots fly , gonna drop pain
i’m game , they think i'm playin but i ain't
why lames act hard , they far from it
killing you ain't nothin but a walk in the park for me
shove you in the middle of the street when a car coming
let’s splash , get hit with an avalanche , king kong bundy
blood leakin' like a virgin pussy at homecoming
dissing me is similar to theivin' some dough from me
get beat like a promoter tryna cheat me on show money
backstage doing blow with a snow bunny
rappers that you thinks dope , we poke fun at
but don’t come at me wrong , homie you don’t want it
these coyote dudes too slow for this roadrunner
.357 throatfucking you , choke on it
no one is fucking with tech or krizz or ces cru
or lynch , kutty , big scoob or ¡mayday !
you see the snake and bat upon a necklace , they know it’s ( strange )
we’re the number 1 independent
see us win and ever since your skinned and ended
fuck an image , all the mimics , trends and gimmicks
hop us in , and they're given the business pimpin'
ya - uh - yeah ! bitch , rittz
fuck an image , all the mimics , trends and gimmicks
hop us in , and they're given the business pimpin'
ya - uh - yeah !
this is what you waited for ( x3 )
tech told me to kill em , say no more
this is what you waited for ( x3 )
strange in this bitch and we waging war
tech told me to kill em , say no more
strange in this bitch and we waging war
give me a piece of it , i’mma feast on it
beast on it , he see a leak in the industry
he’s on it , killer chop of the choppers
it ain’t no time for gettin on em
strip until they topless , come out lookin marvelous
and so you get the barking dog , we never park at all
willing the niggas that kicked it off
and if we get to talk it on , we get to nodding off
leave it to tech and rittz and all
king of the topper , same king thingofabobber
many teeth like i'm eatin a whopper
freakin improper , can’t see me on the doppler
your daughter want me cause i’m pop - popular
you can say no more ain't no more to say , kaliko
you can't ignore any normal day
niggas is horrible , course i’m forced to say
never could hold a torch to immortal k
because i make the jealous fellas tell us when they trail the
elders killers feel us can’t impale us
compare the heroes , it’s zeroes of their era
we're the neros , underground getting the euros
( okay ) this is what you waited for
baby boy , this ain’t the chorus
i’m just playing i ain’t got to say no more
i’m just playing i ain’t got to say no more
get up on 'em , i'll kill em , he’s a banana so peel him
with ammunition i fill em , we diggin a hole
man i got the milla for reala , i get to chillin with villa
and hit the grill with the steela , we takin a soul
step in the circle with us you're gonna pay a toll
gonna be working to put the body in the morgue
sucker , you never gonna get the weapon to fold the soldier
animals in the road , never slow the cobra
callin me insane is a name with honor
evil up in the brain make a bane persona
mentally in pain when i rain the lamma
on any fucking lame who wanna bring the drama
pickin the punk and push him to pay
pop a pill 'pon his people and pray
peep at you passive for penalty play
pitches , pasta , pregnant pussy penne
i’m sorry y'all , talking about a demon and a hardy fall
when i should have been having a ball and a party y'all
nigga mardi gras , hella gnarly y'all
but i came to rage , i aim to wage a war
change the game derranged i came for gore
nigga or came here to spray galore
i done said a whole lot and i say no more , cha
bitch ! tech n9ne !
( i don't care about what they think
i write my life and from that came strange music )
came here to spray galore
i done said a whole lot and i say no more
