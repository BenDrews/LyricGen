blast off ! up to the stars we go
and leave behind everything i used to know
somebody's giving me a whole lot of money to do
what i think i want to
so why am i still feeling blue ?
oh wuan and dondo
goddamn , get your head out of your hands
here's to all the times we're gonna have
cooped up for a year with the two best - looking babes i've seen all year
get me another bottle of beer
'cos i'm feeling fine
go ahead , waste your head
we've got the time
i hope you don't object if i
speak my mind
don't forget the purpose of the mission
or nomis will be swallowed by its sun
each one of you is a top graduate of the star corps academy
it's up to you reach for a dream
oh wuan and dondo
go ahead and waste your life
on silly fears
i hope you don't object if i
crack another beer
hold on , who is it here that i see ?
wasn't she a she a favorite bitch in the academy ?
i don't know if i wanna lead on this woman
you know i've done that before
she's actually a good girl
or at least a cheap ho
