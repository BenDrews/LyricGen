what's wrong with me ?
i'm kinda funny
i'm not a dummy
but i'm all alone
nobody sees me
no one talks to me
unless they're laughing
laughing at me
except for her
she was my true friend
dancing with me
she was my girlfriend
somebody , please , tell her for me
wanda , you're my only love
you're so lucky
your family's normal
mom drives a big rig
my daddy's gay
no matter to her
she was my true friend
dancing with me
she was my girlfriend
somebody , please , tell her for me
wanda , you're my only love
until the day i threw you away
now i'm alone , and i wish you were home
