little one , how long i've waited here
waited for so many lonely years
nobody ever could make me smile
'til you came 'round with your pretty style
and i will love you so
and i will love you so
'cause i was made for you
and you were made for me
and that is all i know
you're all that i can see
'cause i was made for loving you
and all the little things you do
remind me who i am inside
happiness is such a fickle thing
nothing compares to what you can bring
you can bring meaning to what i do
that is why i want to be with you
and i will love you so
and i will love you so
'cause i was made for you
and you were made for me
and that is all i know
you're all that i can see
'cause i was made for loving you
and all the little things you do
remind me who i am inside
my darling , i need you
i'd give myself to please you
my darling , i need you
i want you to be mine
'cause i was made for you
and you were made for me
and that is all i know
you're all that i can see
'cause i was made for you
and you were made for me
and that is all i know
you're all that i can see
'cause i was made for loving you
and all the little things you do
remind me who i am inside
remind me who i am inside
remind me who i am inside
