you gave your love to me softly
i heard your heart beating true
still your bijon lingers on and on and on
you gave your love to me softly
when i'm feeling blue and lonely
all i have to do is think of you
we had just one night but it lingers on and on and on
you gave your love to me softly
la la la you sang to me
baby don't you cry
put your arms around me child
and lay with me tonight
you gave your love to me softly
woah - oh la you sang to me
baby don't you cry
put your arms around me child
and lay with me tonight
woah - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh
woah - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh
