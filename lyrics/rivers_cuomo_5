i wanna know
what were you doing with my friend ?
out in the eve
deep in the shady glen i saw you
lying with him , down in the snow
letting him do all of the things that he wants to
what does he do ?
what does he do to you that's so nice ?
and how does it feel
when he takes your hand and kisses it twice ?
lying with you , down in the snow , letting him do
all of the things he wants to
( come on come on come on i feel it )
so you laugh and play around
( come on come on come on i see it )
fall and hit the ground
( come on come on come on i feel it )
you think i'll never know
( come on come on come on i see it )
your lover in the snow
letting him fill you up with his wine
letting him flatter you with his line
letting him put you down on the snow
taking him in and letting me go
( come on come on come on )
it hurts for me to see you so
( come on come on come on )
and i can't take you back no more
( come on come on come on )
lover in the snow
( come on come on come on i feel it )
