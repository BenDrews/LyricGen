sometimes i want to pack it all up
get on a bus and move to vermont
or maine or any of those states back east
that i remember...
sometimes i wanna go back to school
an east coast college with some history
i'd be satisfied i know in the simple things
longtime sunshine
longtime sunshine upon me
sometimes i want to build a house
with a wood stove or a fire place
in the middle of the livingroom
an old piano...
sometimes it don't seem so bad
to settle down with a good woman
leave this lonely life behind
forever and ever
longtime sunshine
longtime sunshine upon me
longtime sunshine
longtime sunshine upon me
sometimes i wanna get in a car
close my eyes and drive real fast
keep on going 'till i get someplace
where i can truly rest
longtime sunshine
longtime sunshine upon me
longtime sunshine
longtime sunshine upon me
