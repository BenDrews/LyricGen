listen to me
i've got to clear the air
there's something i've held way down deep inside all these years
you always were a friend
you always trusted me
but now i must admit that i was not trustworthy
i let you down
i sold you out
i turned away as you fell onto the ground
i was scared
and i was terrified
i was lost and so i shied away
and i don't know what i can do to make it up to you
i can't turn back the clock
i can't rewrite the book
but if i could , the end would be happy
you would be safe
and i would be proud to look at you when i look you in the face
i let you down
i sold you out
i turned away as you fell onto the ground
i was scared
i was terrified
i was lost and so i shied away
though i love you
i was so afraid
i could not think of anything to say
though i loved you ( though i loved you )
though i trusted you
though i needed you ( though i needed you )
i was so afraid
i was so afraid ( i was so afraid )
and i promise that i'll never ever do
the thing that i did on that day when i acted like the fool
i might get my ass beat
my throat slit , and my fingers hacked
but i'll never miss another chance to watch my brother's back ( and i got yours )
i let you down
i sold you out
i turned away as you fell onto the ground
i was scared
i was terrified
i was lost and so i shied away
i was scared
i was terrified
i was lost and so i let you down
