my brain is working overtime
i need something to ease my mind
and as my thoughts go manic
i really start to panic
there’s no place to hide behind
i freak and then hallucinate
i go at lights when i should wait
my parents think i’m lazy
but damn i’m going crazy
i can’t help my mental state
pick it up y'all , pick it up
ooh lala ( he’s trippin’ )
la dee dah ( mental slippin’ )
take these brains out of my way
i work into a frenzied clip
i bite the corners of my lip
i’m losin’ my appetite
my pants don’t even fit right
take away the month - old dip
my hair could start a bowl cut fad
the state of my attire is sad
and if i was run over
by a brand new range rover
hey , i'd actually be glad
pick it up y'all , pick it up
ooh lala ( he’s trippin’ )
la dee dah ( mental slippin’ )
take these brains out of my way
do you really want me down ?
do you really want me ?
do you really want me down ?
'cause i'm waiting to see
my brain is working overtime
i need something to ease my mind
and as my thoughts go manic
i really start to panic
there’s no place to hide behind
pick it up y'all , pick it up
ooh lala ( he’s trippin’ )
la dee dah ( mental slippin’ )
take these brains out of my way
