god save the queen
nah she ain't mates with me
but she keeps my paper green
plus we are neighbours see
on this little island
where we're all surviving
politeness mixed with violence
this is england
this is england
the bridge we living in
a kicharee simmering
women in hijaabs , syringe popstars
and the promise of a patel as a 'man u' star
where the money you make and the man you are
standing opposites so we drink too hard
the banks rob you and the news is half
the truth wrapped up in boobs and arse
pigs hit kids so
bricks hit windows and the high street burns
with broken dreams and herb
only thing you can't find in tesco is that and a sense of worth
so hide behind a benz or furs
go online to find friends or perv
but click the wrong site for a free trial later detention first

this is england
where you can get famous fast for a day
or you can get bailiffs asking for pay
a list to faceless everybody plays
roll the dice it's always snake eyes mate
racist beef , cakes and tea
all go together like a doh - rey - mee
the hills are alive with the sound of music
giro cheques and schools that creek
soon we all gonna be moving east
delhi and beijing , make some room please
and of the empire strikes back
but them sides are packed , save your seats
till then we just make the darkest beats
great chapatis and rave on our streets
is britain great ? well hey don't ask me
but it's where i live and why my heart beats
god save the queen
nah she ain't mates with me

so big up the queens christmas speech
and all the shit her kids get for free
big up the stiff upper lip half cos were posh
half off the class a's and bass drops
big up the class born to rule
all in the same class since boarding school
we only all in it together to watch x factor and penalty shootouts that we lose
hair of the dog , or beard for your god
after mosque or pub it's curry and kebabs
and the weather is so crap
but still we sunbathe with the rain on tap
try make the best of what's bad
that's why we wave the flag
knee deep in the field of mud with 63 million screaming fans
all for a green , pleasant land
all for a mean and pleasant land
all for a mean and pleasant land
god save the queen
nah she ain't mates with me
but she keeps my paper green
