can't face the day
don't wanna shower dress or shave
sun's out , people in shades
to me its all grey i stay in the duvet
i was all bless and vibes
til a vortex comes i crumble inside
stare at the wall and phone i switch off
don't care at all and work can get lost
no reason i can pin down
guess i'm a bit depressed a bit down
bit like i wanna pick a wrist to slit
but all my gillettes and bics are shit now
rusted , blunt
stare at the blade all busted shrunk
used to be sharp but now just junk
am i looking at a blade or a mirror
looking back at this useless cunt
i want you to know that
sunburst will soon come
after rainclouds
exercise
run , hit the gym , feel alive
meditation yoga
vitamin supplements , stay sober
have a night out
socialise , let loose , wild' out
still feeling shit ?
put on a brave face you weak little prick
they don't understand , feel so far from plans
these tricks of the trade all scratch the surface
why pimp my cage when the prison is worthless
listen i've heard this all before mate
this isn't fun , performance or fake
i don't curl up and bun to james blake
but i am falling when the feeling takes me
i want you to know that
sunburst will soon come
after rainclouds
first things first
don't beat yoursef up it makes things worse
its not your fault its all just comical
you're not a prick , you're sick , it's medical
second of all don't hold it down
you're not alone in this ghost town
its gravity it has to be we go down
a lot of lost soldiers rolling around
assuming the worse , bruised form the hurt
wanna see life in a rear view from a hearse
confused bout what to do but a third
of us feel this , at some point , i've heard
from tramps to rockstars
so gotta reach out to connect the dots up
not afraid to say i've seen my doctor
life's still a bitch but i got the dog on a collar
so please still dollar in the tick of the night
every superman's got a kryptonite
you da man you the girl just not tonight
it ; s an off day write it off , it's alright
you'll ride it out and then you'll laugh
please believe that this too shall pass
you'll ride it out and then you'll laugh
please believe that this too shall pass
too shall pass
i want you to know that
sunburst will soon come
after rainclouds
