in these sour times
please allow me to vouch for mine
bitter taste in my mouth , spit it out with a rhyme
i'm losing my religion to tomorrow's headlines
forestgate – sorry mate ?
nah , nothing , it's fine
please allow me to vouch for mine
bitter taste in my mouth , spit it out with a rhyme
i'm losing my religion to tomorrow's headlines
forestgate – sorry mate ?
nah , nothing , its fine
and now it's post 7/7
why they calling it that ?
they're trying to link it to new york
like we’re all under attack from the same big bad guy
but it's taking the piss
'cause the truth is al qaeda doesn’t really exist
there ain’t no super villain planning these attacks from some base
the truth is so much scarier and harder to face
see , there's thousands of angry young men that are lost
sidelined in the economy , a marginal cost
they think there's no point in putting ballots up in the box
they got no place in this system , and no faith in its cogs
they're easy targets , that be getting brainwashed by these knobs
who say that spilling innocent blood is pleasing a god
well , it sounds good when you don’t see no justice or jobs
the gas bills are piling up , but all the oil's getting robbed
so david taking out goliath , and his wife and his dog
segregated , castrated , now we see who’s on top !
so see , it ain’t religious faith that’s causing these crimes
it’s losing faith in democratic free market designs
it’s no coincidence that bombers came from ghettos up north
and the way that bush and blair talk gives a lost boy a cause
then double standards get 'em angered , both at home and abroad
there's a monopoly on pens that's why they forge their own swords
they're misguided , turned violent , strapped themselves up with bombs
but they're still cowards , 'cause they ain’t here when the backlash is on
in these sour times

abu ghraib – sorry mate ?
nah , nothing , its fine
so all the mans that wanna say that my religion has to change
that we’re stuck in a bygone age
it's time to set the vinyl straight
don’t you think it’s kind of strange that all this terror outrage
these last gasp castaways
these bastards that will blast away
just turned up in the last decade
when islam has been the way for millions
from back in the day
instead of thinking that we’re crazed
investigate just what it says
fast , help the poor , and pray
go mecca , feast , fast and faith
that’s the basics , that the base
so how did we get here today ?
well , interpretations always change
today , they're read with rage
been jihad - ened up
desperation's kinda fucked
makes you use a book of peace as weapons in iraq
so listen , terrorism isn’t caused by religion or an old school vision of islam
it’s against the quran , it’s a new innovation caused by mash - up situations
that’s what makes them turn to arms
the problem is modern and it’s all local factors
dictatorships , injustices and wars cause fatwa’s
in these sour times
please allow me to vouch for mine

nah , nothing , its fine
