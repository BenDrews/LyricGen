selfish love is the type we share
i want your elfish touch and your pelvis here
hot top shelf hugs , come don't be scared
let me sweep away your feet , now it's only fair
she won't open up because of what she's been through
with her pops , first whopps , and her sleazy crew
maybe i can be that nice clean dream for you
be the first to get a taste of your creamy truth
wanna smash that wall like a berlin youth
wanna be the one you're hooked on hurting you
it's an ego thing , i wanna lock you down
'cause you're intricately infinite as london town
wanna see you on your back with a smiley stare
having you on your back foot when i'm firing glares
open it , i don't like you tying your hair
drop your guard , but i never said the fight was fair
you can't have all of me
but give me all of you
i wanna walk tall knowing that i'm owning you
check check , kick about , one two , one two
give it up , get it out , say i got you
you can't have all of me
but give me all of you
i wanna walk tall knowing that i'm owning you
check check , kick about , one two , one two
give it up , get it out , say i got you
cause it's not love , it's a war for you
let me be more for you , just give me all of you
works best when i'm just ignoring you
but you know the moves and you're cold as smooth
so now i'm digging in your trenches , bending you
and you're no - man's - land , wanna enter you
but on a gentle knee , i wear my stomping boots
same talk , love talk , give me coochie - coo
but you stab when you walk and you bore me true
and i'm pranxious coming off the phone to you
i would never make a family a home with you
and all the skits bullshit you're just boobs and suit
sit still , come here , who the fuck is you ?
baby i just wanna crack you till you fall for me
just give me all of you , becomes more for me
you can't have all of me
but give me all of you
i wanna walk tall knowing that i'm owning you
check check , kick about , one two , one two
give it up , get it out , say i got you
you can't have all of me
but give me all of you
i wanna walk tall knowing that i'm owning you
check check , kick about , one two , one two
give it up , get it out , say i got you
you're a heart shaped , tart faced rubik's cube
you little fast paced , dark - laced floozy you
why don't you love me ? tell me i got you
but once you want me , i won't want you
you're a heart shaped , tart faced rubik's cube
you little fast paced , dark - laced floozy you
why don't you love me - i want you to
but once you want me then i won't want you
because all of my smiles just come out sad
flashbacks of your soft thighs drive me mad
wise words that you wore like a secret badge
and the times we had were just lies you spat
but i don't really feel deeply at all for you
i know it's sad , isn't it , but it's the awful truth
and you're playing me and him ? we made a whore of you
and the pride sends me mad , i'm ignoring you
it's like i've given up the weed but want a toke or two
it's not filling up my needs so i blow hoops
now i'm scribbling my grief on a piece of you
like i'm nibbling for greed on a greasy stew
in my bedside table there's a drawer for you
red fishnets , hair clips , loads of lube
there's a dirty laundry bag full of clothes for you
my clean sheets are spoiled but i'm over you
you can't have all of me
but give me all of you
i wanna walk tall knowing that i'm owning you
check check , kick about , one two , one two
give it up , get it out , say i got you
you can't have all of me
but give me all of you
i wanna walk tall knowing that i'm owning you
check check , kick about , one two , one two
give it up , get it out , say i got you
