once it was budget and rubbish and proper duggish here
then , " we wanna rough it , we love it , we're takin' over here ! " and all these posh up - and - comers pushin' us out of here , nah it's too lovey , yo let's get out of here
but now we all in the ghetto , now we all in the ghetto
squattin' like it's hot
all in the ghetto
cheap not cheerful
all in the ghetto
push up the rent

fresh outta university , we scout a cool and dirty scene. somewhere nice and cheap with lots of turkish peeps or caribbeans. authentic with rent i can afford. k , we got cool jobs that will keep us poor
cheap pizzas , whores , ( brap ! brap ! ) , gang wars. there's a certain ambiance you can't help but adore. creatives and professionals are comin' in hordes and bicycles that might as well be little trojan horses
locals don't like this , to the cool new parties they ain't invited. it's your trashy phase but it's how i live. what the fuck's a latte ; what's with these prices ?
boo hoo hoo , see how it's all changed ? used to be community , now i don't know the neighbors' names. ooh ooh ooh now it's not the same. we came when it was real and now the scene's got tame
okay

art gallery , top end , it's called the den cuz once it was the hot spot for crack. monday nights we sip martinis at the crack fiend's back. really brings the art alive like rock stars on smack !
somebody got shot for 99 pence outside the vegan spot i frequent. but wid' our nice bread we like excitement , so that put the prices up 9 percent
now when we all go in for a whole - grain sammwich , we go wearin' a cool , fake , blood - stained bandage. it's trashionable to look trampy , but is that an art installation or a homeless man ?
so when i move to my manor with my artist's life , artichokes , and my nice tofu fried , they supply my demand to build somewhere nice , and it's good for everyone if you can pay the price

brown , black , and polish , my ends are brown , black , and polish , 'round here is brown , black , and polish. it hasn't been tidied up yet. brown , black , and polish , from the sky it looks like cheap bread slightly toasted. bread crumbs up on the table with the roaches. kids pop out of their cots into their doltage
brown , black , and polish , well you already know this , been through the ends like a tourist

every color's represented but separate. it's a pot but i've never seen it melting. men stacking up the pennies that you're spending. to their families back home is where they send it. a few poor white old peeps left here , the rest all left here
