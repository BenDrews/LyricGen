once upon a time when money was king
people thought life was all about bling
they borrow a lot just to buy nice things
but tomorrow on their butts their debt will bite them
they wanted to own more
banks wanted to loan more
politicians wanna see the economy grow more
so though bob's too poor to afford it
he's given a load of dough for a mortgage
everybody ballin'
broker get boneless
lender buys porsche
bob puts rims on his skoda
traders rack up the debt and sell it on though its bogus
the interest on his debt's a nice lump
merry christmas time to slice up
bob's turkey and all the banks nibble a bit
so when bob defaults they all get the shits
when the house of cards come falling down
i'm left holding the joker
did we come so far for it to all fall down ?
i gave you my dreams and you broke them
dominos fall
casa del bob is no more
but in a pond he's so small
big fishes bank profits off toxic debt
can't flop the consequences so raw
so bob's home is foreclosed but the government begs the banks for more dough
they call it a bailout
and they're using the tax bob paid out
but still the economy's whiplashed
to get a movin' the government print cash
so call queen lizzie she brings the whole fleet
the banks get a triple sweet bonus ( what ! )
but now bob's officially homeless ( wha - )
and the money they got they supposed to loan us
stock market dives
businesses can't get money or survive
at work bob gets a p45
from property ladder to poverty land
when the house of cards come falling down
i'm left holding the joker
did we come so far for it to all fall down ?
i gave you my dreams and you broke them
while bob is jobless the banks have got this free money
like a lollypop off a toddler
they're not gonna lend it to dumb shit public bob nah
they put it in commodity stocks ( yah )
buy out the basics
the trader's treating these like casino dice
inflates the price of bread
the poor in the east need their toast
they go to war with police and pharaohs
gets together friends that are all effected
heads into town and they start protesting
with students right and lefties
stop the war folk and soldiers broke no pension
the media don't trust him
and the government just can't hush them
all the globe sees the normal folk lead
it's 99 v the 1 percent's greed
they're outnumbered now whenever it must be
something they hadn't agreed
whilst they sleep the police just rushed 'em
the revolution
but it was twittervised
now a new way of thinking has crystallised
thrown off the broken gold chain
we no longer sold our growth for growth's sake
starting a revo right now we change the main stream
we ain't gotta refund the new jobs
we ain't one man more than a few lost
but now we got new thoughts
and maybe that's worth more than a few bob
when the house of cards come falling down
i'm left holding the joker
did we come so far for it to all fall down ?
i gave you my dreams and you broke them
when the house of cards come falling down
i'm left holding the joker
did we come so far for it to all fall down ?
i gave you my dreams and you broke them
oh , oh , oh
oh , oh , oh
oh you broken them
yeah , oh
