all this planning and to - do lists
resolutions every new year's
fear of failing , expectations
don't you feel it's time to do this
dreaming what might be
does enough and does it nicely
every morning wakes me yawning
safe when boredom lies beside me
it is quiet , i hear whispers
telling me 'it's now or never'
don't wanna sit and wonder
how it could've been
what you waiting for ?
now tell me what you waiting for ?
ask yourself , what you waiting for
what you waiting for ?
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
i don't know if people watch me
all looks fine , i'm smiling softly
deep inside , this knife is not me
clock ticks , cobwebs , i sip coffee
squint your eyes , you'll really see me
blinking like a dusty tv
automatic , noise and static
all distract from what i could be
it is quiet , i hear whispers
telling me it's now or never
don't wanna sit and wonder
how it could've been
what you waiting for ?
now tell me what you waiting for ?
ask yourself , what you waiting for
what you waiting for ?
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
get on it
