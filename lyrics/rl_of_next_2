you could find me in the gentlemen's club
substitutin' lap dance just for love , love , love
goin' home to an empty house
thinkin' who should i call for some fun , hey
i never knew love until you loved
never thought that i'd fall in love
till you brought out a man
the man i always knew i could be , baby
i can't count the lovers that i've had
and all of those relationships gone bad
i wanna thank you for guiding me
and showing me love
i was just a boy and not a man
falling deep in love was not the plan
baby , because of you and what you do
you made me a good man , oh , baby
used to change my numbers every other the week
gettin' crazy crank calls from them freaks
i be , in v.i.p wit a bottle of somethin
tryin' hard to push up on some peps
â€˜cause i - i never knew love until you , love
you showed me a true love
you gave me the chance
now i understand how to be a good man , oh , yes
i can count the lovers that i've had ( i've had )
all of those relationships gone bad ( relationships )
i wanna thank you for guiding me
and showing me love ( love , yea )
i was just a boy and not a man ( not a man , no )
falling deep in love was not the plan
baby , because of you ( you , you , you ) and what you do
you made me a good man
thank you for lovin' me
where is the love that you promised to love and
when was the love that we share , where is your love
oh , yeah
but if it ain't you , my love's for nobody , nobody
nobody , nobody , nobody , nobody
( oh...oh...oh...oh...oh... )
i can count the lovers that i've had ( baby , baby )
all of those relationships gone bad
i wanna thank you for guiding me
and showing me the hope
i was just a boy and not a man
falling deep in love was not the plan
baby , because of you and what you do
you made me a good man , oh , baby
it's all because of
you - you - you - you - you - you - you - you - you
