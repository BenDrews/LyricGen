i never really had much direction you know
this time i followed my heart and i found you
i lay in bed holding my pillow close
feeling so alone
with an emptiness deep in my soul
looking for someone to hold
then i found you baby
i never fell in love like this right here
i never loved someone like you my dear
never saw directions that were so clear
love led me to you , to you
love led me to you
my heart had been broken many times
love made me hurt inside
but you came into my life
made every day like valentine's
now i understand why
i weathered the storm for my sunshine
i never fell in love like this right here
i never loved someone like you my dear
never saw directions that were so clear
love led me to you , toy you
love led me to you
love led me to you
i never fell in love like this right here
i never loved someone like you my dear
never saw directions that were so clear
love led me to you , to you
love led me to you
love led me to you
all my sunshine that warms ? ? ?
a rare flower i'll never let you go
the air i breathe like a summer breeze
you saved my heart
baby , i know you heard about my past
but it took all of those to break my heart
for me to be stronger for you
i know what you're thinkin'
but no , you're not just another one
just meant to be
i never fell in love like this right here
i never loved someone like you my dear
never saw directions that were so clear
love led me to you
love led me to you
i never fell in love like this right here
love led me to you
and i never loved someone like you my dear
love led me to you
never saw directions that were so clear
love led me to you , to you baby
love led me to you , to you
love led me to you
love led me to you
love led me to you
love led me to you
i never fell in love like this right here
love led me to you
and i never loved someone like you my dear
love led me to you
never saw directions that were so clear
love led me to you
love led me to you
i never fell in love like this right here
love led me to you
and i never loved someone like you my dear
love led me to you
never saw directions that were so clear...
