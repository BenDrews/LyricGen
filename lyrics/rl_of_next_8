talking :
hey , i know we haven't spoken much i just um , wanted to tell you that i wanted to see you and im sorry that it didn't work out things just ain't the same you know , well , let me explain
verse 1 :
we used to talk alot
now we hadley even speak
harldey even kiss
haven't made love in weeks
my heart is getting weak
girl it hurts me deep
im thinkin should i stay
or maybe should i leave
chorus :
youve been wondering how i feel
you dont know
been wondering why im here
i dont know
is this what we both feared
we dont know
is the end to this near ?
our hearts say no
verse 2 :
it used to be so right
we used to be a team
talk long everynight
we used to share our dreams
i miss those little things
its been so long it seems
but i know i shouldn't leave
cause only you got what i need
repeat chorus 2x
