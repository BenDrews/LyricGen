so this is how it ends
in separate beds
a wall between us
and this is how it dies
separate our lives
and hope it heals us
i chose the love of strangers
i chose the fickle crowd
and the woman i wagered
won't look at me right now
not now
i know i've been like a house cat
give me this , give me that
and i know i'll be okay
but beg for my attention
or work from my affection
i just stare and walk away
how can i show you
i'd do all i could do
to show you i adore you ?
olivia
and the days go by
in a supplicated style
hand me the anodynes
oh , olivia
i still love you
and i know i will
'til i die
and this feels like
common madness
why this wasted life ?
come to me
the photographer is lucky
does he even know my name ?
does he know i'd give it all up
if i only could be here ?
but i used all my chances
and a few after that
now i'm floating in the ashes
olivia
and the days go by
in a supplicated style
hand me the anodynes
oh , olivia
i still love you
and i know i will
'til i die
and this feels like
common madness
why this wasted life ?
come to me
