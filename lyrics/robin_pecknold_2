i'm a fast breather , i'm a hairless dog
and alone at the end of the day , i am just like the gathering fog
i'm a slow mover , i'm the best laid plans
and alone at the end of the day , i just sit with my head in my hands
but we speak easy and we seldom fight
and i chew on the bones of the day while you sleep soft and warm in the night
and i can't see you , with anyone else
even if that means holding me down , even if that means losing myself
he's a smooth talker
and he shaves his face
and i wonder if you look at me and instead see him taking my place
but i do need you , and no one else
and i hope you're around and forgiving when you see me losing myself
