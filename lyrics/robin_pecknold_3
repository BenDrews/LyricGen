where is my wild rose ?
where is my flower ?
where is my wild rose ?
where are you wandering now ?
ramble you in connemara
across that misty moor
and does your heart beat loudly
by killarney's stony shore
and do you bloom in dublin
i've enquired in stephen's green
i've searched through londonderry
twixt the orange and the green
and as busy as they were
they sloped arms for a while
to muse on you with rich sweet brogue
red remembered with a smile
they said you passed as a ghost
walks through the hazel wood
or aengus searching for his love
walks through the hazel wood
where is my wild rose ?
where is my flower ?
where is my wild rose ?
where are you wandering now ?
