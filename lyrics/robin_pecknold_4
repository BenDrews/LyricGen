don't sing love songs ; you'll wake my mother
she's sleeping here , right by my side
and in her right hand , a silver dagger
she says that i can't be your bride
all men are false , says my mother
they'll tell you wicked , lovin' lies
and the very next evening , they'll court another
leave you alone to pine and sigh
my daddy is a handsome devil
he's got a chain five miles long
and on every link a heart does dangle
of another maid he's loved and wronged
so court another tender maiden
and hope that she will be your wife
for i have been warned and i've decided
to sleep alone all of my life
don't sing love songs ; you'll wake my mother
she's sleeping here , right by my side
and in her right hand , a silver dagger
she says that i can't be your bride
