how does it feel
when life doesn't seem real
and you're floating about on your own
your life seems uncertain
so you draw the curtain
pretending there's nobody home
( chorus )
don't theorize
look in your eyes
they can't tell lies
though you may disguise what you see
the mirror is free
we once had a savior
but by our behavior
the one that was worth it is gone
song birds are talking
and runners are walking
a prodigal son's coming home
( chorus )
don't theorize
look in his eyes
they won't tell lies
but if he defies what you see
he'll give you a key
be yourself ( why don't you be yourself ? )
be yourself ( why don't you be... ? )
we needed a tutor
so built a computer
and programmed ourselves not to see
the truth and the lying
the dead and the dying
a silent majority
( chorus )
so don't theorize
look in their eyes
are they telling lies
the ones that you see on t.v
what a way to be free
be yourself ( why don't you be yourself ? )
be yourself ( why don't you be yourself ? )
be yourself ( why don't you be yourself ? )
be yourself ( why don't you be yourself ? )
