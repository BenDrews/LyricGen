out of sight , out of mind
so the story goes
you forgot i exist
my broken heart knows
when out of sight then it's out of mind
especially when you found somebody new
but i can't change my love
umm umm , the way that you do
i sit around and wonder
about your new love affair
that's what you call lookin' back
i should forget to remember
and remember not to care
i'd forget if i could
but my heart is blind
you are gone out of sight
but you're lingering in my mind
