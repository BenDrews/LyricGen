hot on the end again
where you're friends want you to pretend
that everything is fine , that their baby's alright
drag another line from the day through the night
but don't you realize you wear it like the chain
and when you want to try to fix it it remains
but every season cries like a rain in early spring
how wind can seem sing to empty tree and golden leaves that paint the ground
sunlight all around , it seems to cry
yeah , every season cries
sitting alone in the den
we'll read the magazines , reading every word you can
a word can cut the knife but leave you wanting more
the sweat around the eyes , the hunter at your door
can leave you wanting more or throw you to the floor
marionette lenore wants a word with you , both hot on the end again
a fast and lonely friend to lick the wounds , a friend to lick the wounds
yeah
everything's beautiful down where you're heart's alone
down where the feeling's strong , down where the water's cold
yeah
hot on the end again
don't you realize
that everybody's fine and that isn't quite a lie
everything's beautiful down where you're heart's alone
down where the feeling's strong , down where the water's cold
yeah
yeah
