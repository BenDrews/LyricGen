ron isley : well , that was the expression - - people were doing their thing. everybody was saying , " man , do your own thing. " i heard that expression so many times. and johnny taylor had the record out , " who's making love to your old lady ? " and so , " it's your thing , do what you wanna do. i can't tell you who to sock it to. if you want me to love you , maybe i will. believe me woman , it ain't no big deal. you need love just as bad as i do. it makes me no difference who you give your thing to. it's your thing , do your thing. " you know ?
sos : that's great. i never thought of that ! so you viewed it almost as an answer to " who's making love to your old lady ? "
ri : yeah
sos : wow. that's amazing
