sameoldshawn : you mentioned " fight the power , " of course
ron isley : fight the power
sos : what did that phrase mean to you when you first used it ?
ri : ernie wrote that song too - - " fight the power. " i put in some lyrics too - - " all this bullshit going down , " you know ? i said , i'm gonna say this when i sing the record. i'm not gonna tell my brothers i'm gonna say it. i'm gonna see what they thought. because we had " all this nonsense going down , " is what he wrote
so i sang it , and i said , " all this bullshit going down. " and it really gave the feeling to the record. like , " i tried to play my music , they say my music's too loud. i tried talking about it , i got the big runaround. when i rolled with the punches , i got knocked on the ground with all this bullshit going down. "
sos : how did they react when they heard the curse ?
ri : oh man. they just flipped out. we said , we gonna keep that in there. so we played it for disc jockeys and everyone. it wasn't like you were cursing. it was like you were explaining to the max what it was all about. and that's all it was
man , my mother , she really didn't believe in us cursing and that type of thing. but , it explained to the max about that record
