sameoldshawn : i will literally get fired if i don't ask you about " contagious. " it is my boss' favorite song in the whole world. he wanted to know everything about it , but in particular that ending line about , " i'm gonna catch a case , " where that came from
ron isley : r. kelly. now , you know what ? i have to admit this. when i sang the song , i didn't know what " catch a case " meant. i would do it on the stage , and everybody would scream. and i'd say , " what are they talking about ? catch a case of claps ? what are they talking about , catch a case ? "
it was a funny way when they came up to me and said , " 'catch a case' means catch a case in jail. you catch a case , that means you gotta go to jail , you caught this case. "
maybe that should be something i shouldn't even tell , you know ? and so r. kelly just fell on the floor laughing at me
