i had a dream that you were mine
i’ve had that dream a thousand times
a thousand times , a thousand times
i’ve had that dream a thousand times
i left my room on the west side
i walked from noon until the night
i changed my crowd , i ditched my tie
i watched the sparks fly off the fire
i found your house , i didn’t even try
they’d closed the shutters , they’d pulled the blinds
my eyes were red , the streets were bright
those ancient years were black and white
the 10th of november , the year's almost over
if i had your number , i’d call you tomorrow
if my eyes were open , i’d be kicking the doors in
but all that i have is this old dream i’ve always had
a thousand times , a thousand times
i’ve had that dream a thousand times
a thousand times , a thousand times
i’ve had that dream a thousand times
i left my room on the west side
i walked from noon through the night
i changed my crowd , i ditched my tie
i watched the sparks fly off the fire
i found your old house , i didn’t even try
they’d closed the shutters , they’d pulled the blinds
i had a dream that you were mine
i’ve had that dream a thousand times
but i don’t answer questions , i just keep on guessing
my eyes are still open , the curtains are closing
but all that i have is this old dream i always had
a thousand times , a thousand times
i’ve had that dream a thousand times
a thousand times , a thousand times
i’ve had that dream a thousand times
a thousand times , a thousand times
i’ve had that dream a thousand times
a thousand times , a thousand times
i’ve had that dream a thousand times
