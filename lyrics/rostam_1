i live in a nameless town
no need to wander around
i live in a nameless town
in a black out
many friends have said goodbye
paraded out in one proud line
i say they all just lost their minds
midnight where we used to dance
underneath the ugly halogen lamps
oh , it all went away so fast
in a black out
we’ll wait for the year
when the tide comes
rolling over the rails
from here 'til the end
of the island
washing away
i rent a room with all our stuff
when you come home i’d lift you up
and there’s only the two of us
in a black out
now you’re sleeping in the back
of a speeding yellow cab
throw a kiss goodbye to all of that
