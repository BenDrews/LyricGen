sing to me softly
your words had lost me
yeah , but your voice sounds nice
sing to me slowly
blow me some smoke
i don't mind it in my eyes
oh , i've been running
i ran out of room
so i took my pocket change
and bought a chain for you
your suitcase is empty
your clothes are still out
at night i still wonder
why we can't leave this town
don't leave me now
( don't leave me now )
don't leave me now
( don't leave me now )
don't leave me now
( don't leave me now )
don't leave me now
sing to me softly
your words have lost me
yeah , but your tune is right
talk to me slowly
blow me some smoke
it's something i always like
oh , i'd keep humming
that strange hollow tune
'til i blew my pipes out
left my throat in ruins
my heart is so empty
the bottom fell out
tonight , i'm just begging you
please don't shut me out
don't shut me out
( don't shut me out )
don't shut me out
( don't shut me out )
don't shut me out
( don't shut me out )
don't shut me out
and so i sing that song
the one from way back
right now , the hurt is gone
it doesn't sound so bad
yeah , when i sing that song
it doesn't sound so bad
i use the same voice
i always had
i use the same voice
i always had
i use the same voice
i always had
i use the same voice
i always had
