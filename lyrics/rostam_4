on the first night in june
in a very crowded room
the band was going on
when you told me we were done
so i couldn't play that song
cause i wrote it about you
yeah it always seems to come back to you
but i don't have to tell you
cause you've heard it all by now
i'm just one single voice in a choir
you won't hear me anymore
just a bassist thumbing a tune
but that rumble reminds me of you
all the flash , all the fire
all the foggy drinks perspired
we were tucked into a booth
in a far corner of the room
and the music is loud
and it's just bringing me down
cause i know that i lost you
the parking lot was dark
and i walked out of the bar
found some folks hanging around
and we're on some highway now
and the windows are down
and i never felt so sad
so i just tried not to think about you
oh the final spot of sunlight
is dying on the dash
on some way too long road with some way too young folks
if the man that you knew
honestly wasn't me
tell me honey : who could that be ?
there's a letter i wrote
that i'll never send
where i admit my weakness
and i ask to see you again
yeah i heard you were sorry
by someone you call a friend
in a letter i wrote
that i'll never send
cause there's ash in my heart
where i used to burn
the young voices have vanished
the old whispers return
but there's no one to hurt me
and there's no one to hurt
cause there's ash in my heart
where i used to burn
pictures of us dancing
from a lifetime , a lifetime ago
you in a green dress and i in a tweed vest
in a blurry gang of ghosts
pictures of us dancing
from a thousand years ago
late enough to kiss you
still too early to go
