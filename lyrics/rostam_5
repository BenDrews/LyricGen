now it's been so many years
i wish i could say honestly
gravity don't pull me
that feeling coming through my body
a train under my feet
that's hurtling beneath me
and the worst way i ever felt
was from this same boy that i still miss
cause i messed it up
and it broke my heart
and the worst things i ever did
was to this same boy i couldn't help it
i messed things up
and it broke my heart
yeah , the worst way i ever felt
was from this same boy that i still miss
cause i messed it up
and it broke my heart
now it's been so long i honestly
wish i could see clearly
but the memory still hurts me
if i feel it in the morning
a gentle street that's bustling
underneath my open window
but the worst way i ever felt
was from this same boy that i still miss
cause i messed it up
and it broke my heart
and the worst things i ever did
was to this same boy i couldn't help it
i messed things up
and i broke his heart
so i bite my lip and i hold my tongue
and i wait for the pain to be gone
but some days i still let you back in
i bite my lip and i hold my tongue
and i wait for the pain to be gone
but some days , some days , i still let it back in
but the worst way i ever felt
was from this same boy that i still miss
cause i messed it up
and it broke my heart
and the worst things i ever did
was to this same boy i couldn't help it
i messed things up
and it broke my heart
