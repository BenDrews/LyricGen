my ginger voice was raw with smoke
they hid their smiles when i stood and spoke
some sunny lawn , some saturday
a face was flushed when i went to sing
wild mountain thyme
but i was crying before the second line
the strawberry stripes across
my ruddy cheeks got em giggling
my eyes are red and wild and wide
as i choked up over another line
for years and year i disappeared
tonight i'm here and i'm giving my best
it's all i have , the grandkids laugh
my linen vest is yellow stained
and my teeth are chipped , my beard is gray
your mother left , she's not impressed
the wedding guests are starting to get restless
and i think i have worn out my welcome
but i swear i caught you smile
from the corner of my eye
when they threw me off the stage
oh i know i saw you smiling
i swear i saw you smiling
they carried me away
through the center of the crowd
from the corner of my eye
i swear i saw you smiling
you'll always be my darling , sweetheart
