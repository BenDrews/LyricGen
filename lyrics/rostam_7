listen to the crickets at night
can you hear that sound ?
dusk and the tide goes out
your feet in the sand
everyone of us has felt the lights go down
everyone of us has felt our heart beat pound
everyone of us has felt it on our own
lo and behold you were here now you're gone
lo and behold you were here now you're gone
along the coast we could see time and space
and across the water it was all emptiness
but i held you close , my cheek pressed up against yours
and i could feel the hereafter out in front of us both
along the coast we could see time and space
and across the water it was all emptiness
but i held you close , my cheek pressed up against yours
and we could feel the storm gathering in front of us both
ohhhhhh
ohhhh
ohhhhhhhh
ohhhhh
everyone of us has felt the lights go down
everyone of us has felt our heart beat pound
everyone of us has felt the lights go down
everyone of us has felt our heart beat pound
everyone of us has felt it on our own
lo and behold you were here now you're gone
lo and behold you were here now you're gone
