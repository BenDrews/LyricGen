if you don't hear from me tonight
my love , don't be deceived
i won't always see you
when you're calling after me
one day i'll stop to listen
one day i'll stop to listen
but i'd rather die , oh
last night the doorbell rang
some kids were playing pranks
it got me thinking of us
messing around... and some other stuff
so i rumble down your hall
do you hear me through the wall ?
when my head hits the floor
it ain't gonna hurt me , anymore
one day , i'll stop to listen
one day , i'll stop to listen
golden roads , paper towns
watercolor roaring hours
how've you been , i wish that i
could see you now just one more time
don't trust the moonbeams
" moonbeams are off the record "
don't count your heartbeats
you heart won't beat forever
dim your lights , lock your doors
don't forgive me anymore
finally sleeping , blazer torn
lying on your wooden floor
one day i'll stop to listen
one day i'll stop to listen
one day i'll stop to listen
one day i'll stop to listen
don't trust the moonbeams
" moonbeams are off the record "
don't count your heartbeats
your heart won't beat forever
( one day i'll stop to listen
one day i'll stop to listen
one day i'll stop to listen
one day i'll stop to listen )
