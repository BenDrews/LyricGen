i thought i heard the angel's , lord
when i was on the chapel floor
but i'll never be sure
those old familiar harmonies
they carried us through new orleans
in ice water smacking kisses
sour lemon mouthfuls
of black hours , seersucker
powdered sugar moon glow
i know when you're with me
that your spirit's gonna lift me
so i never change directions
and i never ask no questions
oh i wish i could hear it
cause i still feel the spirit
from the rafters to the ceiling
i'm waiting on that feeling
oh i know...
i know that you're coming
are you walking or are you running ?
and i know when you're with me
that your spirit's gonna lift me
oh i know that you're coming
are you walking or are you running ?
and i know when you're with me
that your spirit's gonna lift me
oh i know that you're coming
are you walking or are you running ?
but i know you'll be leaving
yeah you'll always find a reason
oh i know that you're coming
are you walking or are you running ?
oh i know that you're coming
are you walking or are you running ?
