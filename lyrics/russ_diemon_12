and slappin these nitwits , with fat stacks of g's

she goldminin , lookin for new fashion designin
rings with rocks blindin cause my world started shinin , uhh
chorus : miss jones and g rap
sippin wine from up a little grapevine
too much ice up on the wrist to tell the time

baguettes be the ice makin my neck and chest freeze
vietnamese , tibetan g's with wet beads
in sets of three , breasts in 3 - d that slept with me
