well i chased her down the alley
and over the hill to steal her will
she was as hot as georgia asphalt
when the " a " crowd came to adore her brain
so leave virginia alone
leave virginia alone
she's not like you and me
she's not like you and me
you should've seen her back in the city
poetry and jewels , broke all the rules
she was as high as a georgia pine tree
makeup and pills , overdue bills
so leave virginia alone
leave virginia alone
she's not like you and me
she's not like you and me
some sunny day when the hands of time
have had their way
you'll understand why it was so hard to run away
she's a loser she's a forgiver
but she still finds good where no one could
you ought to want her more than money
cadillacs and rust diamonds and dust
so leave virginia alone
leave virginia alone
she's not like you and me
she's not like you and me
so leave virginia alone
leave virginia alone
she's not like you and me
she's not like you and me
