i know you worry ev'ry time i go away
you wonder will these
sweet , sweet feelings shine or fade
well , that's a question
you don't have to ask
what heaven makes
it always makes to last
gold don't rust
love don't lie
i'll be true 'til the day that i die
trust in me , you will find
baby
you're the gold in this heart of mine
and that gold will shine
for a long , long time
i wish that i could give you
what you need from me
but what good
is a promise or a guarantee ?
love is still a simple act of faith
and a faithful heart
is always worth the wait
gold don't rust
love don't lie
i'll be true 'til the day that i die
trust in me , you will find
baby
you're the gold in this heart of mine
and that gold will shine
for a long , long time
love is still a simple act of faith
and a faithful heart
is always worth the wait
gold don't rust
love don't lie
i'll be true 'til the day that i die
trust in me , you will find
baby
you're the gold in this heart of mine
and that gold will shine
for a long , long time
baby you're the gold
in this heart of mine
and that gold will shine
for a long , long , long time
