thank big god he had time to look now
and i've
read your words
and i

what you love , so much
it hurts , to watch
what you love , so much
i was blind to time as time can be
open eyes don't always need to see
and i've
read your words
and i
read some worse
but it hurts , to watch
what you love , so much
it hurts , to watch
what you love , so much
you handed me an avalanche
encouragement to manifest
it won't be long 'til i'm allowed
to bellyback ( ? ) , it's all worthwhile
well it hurts , to watch
what you love , so much
it hurts , to watch
what you love , so much
it hurts , to watch
what you love , so much
and it ( false start at 2 : 16 )
