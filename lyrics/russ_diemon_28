how i ever made it to you heaven only knows
with the doors and the windows to my inside closed
i don't now how you got in
but i'll never let you out again
chorus
cause you make me feel every single drop of rain
my heart's revealed every time i hear your name
i feel your touch in the sunlight on my skin
the subtle brush of your kisses in the wind
you take my dreams and you make them even more
you make me feel like i never loved before
you lift me high light me on fire
you set me free you let me see
you make me feel
now it seems like everything you do surprises me
i never thought i'd ever really love reality
but you gave me a taste for love
that i couldn't imagine of
chorus
i feel your touch
the subtle brush
and you take my dreams and make them even more
you make me feel like i never loved before
you lift me higher , light me on fire
you set me free
you make me feel
you make me feel
