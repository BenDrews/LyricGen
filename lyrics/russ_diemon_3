they ask me what's good , and i be what's excellent
i'm out here tryna make a dollar out of next to shit
i'm next to blow so i been reading extra lit
i'm astrological with the whip
planet , harvested and bred with the menace instead
i follow god without doing what the minister said
the devil get his rocks off tryna knock me off
nigga try to condescend but i'm still in this bitch
it's just one of them days when you radiating back to the sun
and the energy you giving off combined with his rays
and you come up with 101 ways to get it
that the light bulb in your head give the mama who raised
niggas rushing me to grow up , fuck that
three years ago i didn't have half the moustache
and as you witness me and all my niggas evolve
no that it's all love and if it isn't then you can have your fucks back cause
i'm already on
i'm already on
i'm already on , what it is
i'm already on
i'm already on
i'm already on
i'm already on , what it is
i'm already on
the days have gone but i don't fear at all
i hear amazing songs when i don't think
i know my day is coming to have abundance and in the media time
i'm hypnotising my mind with the key ingredient
yo when they ask me what's good , i be what's excellent
burn the bushes , give to exodus
i'm upper echelon , this shit effortless
using my lexicon is still a stretch from my precipice
we all living for the rush , diamonds studded wishes
multi million dollar dreams and some bundles to collect
when your vision tunnel up , she kick straight into overdrive
some call it overtime , i just call it coming up
massive asteroid , our impact destroyed
everything in my passage , humble , deserving person
no tracks be releasing the wrath
meditate keep me from collapsing
back in 2010 we was nothing but kids
with big eyes and heads to match
young niggas springing to action
5 years in , still showing improvement
out in cali , back to soho
sound like chick getting ratchet so
i'm going on that aeroplane
i'll grow my mary jane
don't know if i'll see him the same
but it always keep me sane
i'm not just , i'm not just fine
i'm not just , i'm not just straight
i'm not just , i'm more than decent
i'm more than great
they ask me what's good , and i be what's excellent
i'm out here tryna make a dollar out of next to shit
i read the mood can be a habit and the consequence big
so i pull an all nighter when the pressure hits
i roll another for my niggas that i never see in person
feeling my own purpose and breathing the nurture
addy every now and then to keep me alert
eat a dick , eat a fist , eat your word , let loose
