my baby's got a reason to fly
guessin i can't win all the time
learnin how to lose with a smile
screwin me over
and send me to back of the line
you could of told me then
but you tell me now
can you tell me why ?
take all my stimulants
wait and see what the
world throws at me next
take all my depressants
take it all and don't give me
no severance
you could of told me then
but you tell me now
can you tell me why ?
maybe you got a boyfriend now
maybe you fucked up like me
and how
i got sweeter thing in my mouth
i swallow'em and the i shit them out
you could of told me then
but you tell me now
can you tell me why ?
you could of told me then
but you tell me now
why dont you
tell me why ? tell me why
