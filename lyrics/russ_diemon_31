she’s got her high heels on and she’s working the floor
she’ll slip a $20 in your pocket just for holding the door
now where did she come from ? and why should you care ?
man you ought to see her when she lets down her hair
but she ain't yours
you can’t hold her
you can’t love her
cause she ain't yours
she steps out of the car down on the avenue
she don’t need no reservations but she needs them from you
she’ll smile like she means it take her to the store
but it all comes down to business when it’s time to go
but she ain't yours
you can’t hold her
you can’t love her
cause she ain't yours

hittin’ all the wrong numbers on the telephone
while you’re falling in love , you’re fallin’ down
what happen to you when you go down ?
that’s just the way she moves
that’s just the way she moves
it’s unreal
it’s quiet in here you’re feeling alone
the lights they are flashing but there’s nobody home
can’t just go to the doctor and check out your head
i don’t know what to say , but man you heard what i said
but she ain't yours
you can’t hold her
she ain't yours
you can’t love her
she ain't yours
you can’t lover
she ain't yours
don’t you know how i feel
oh , it’s unreal
that’s the way she moves
it’s just the way she…
