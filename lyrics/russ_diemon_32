i had a dream that the van broke down , i walked you all the way back home
it's such a drag waking up sometimes , into this life i know
hungover and horny
too sick to call
i'm as hard as a rock
i should be havin' a ball
last night i went looking for fun
i took it just a little to far
it's such a drag getting slapped in the face
when you're sittin in the back of a car
hungover and horny
too sick to call
i'm as hard as a rock
i should be havin' a ball
hey !
screw driver , fix my soul
find my baby , bring her home
bloody maria , my my my
little bit of tequilla , seein red in my eyes !
hungover and horny
too sick to call
i'm as hard as a rock
i should be havin' a ball
it's just the way that my mouth is dry
my clothes they just smell like smoke
it's just a drag why you can't remember
all the reasons why you're hurt
hungover and horny
i'm gonna explode !
i'm as hard as a rock
baby please come home
i'm as hard as a rock
baby plase come home
if you don't come home
i don't come at all - l - l - l - l
woo !
ahh !
