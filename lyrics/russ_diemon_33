( one , two , one two three )
i heard the albums ; i took note , of all necessities to be an artist
i closed my eyes ; i shut my snout , i clawed my arms up inside of the closet
i walked the path ; lit by moon , and i swept my broom behind me
i changed my diet , i slept under stars , and my long hair still stained bloody
i start my songs , i stopped writing my thoughts , and i gave in to the big void
i knew some girl that broke my heart , and i love that sinking feeling
i lied to my friends , tell them i love to see them , just to keep me away from me
i gave up my name , and potential fame , 'cause i did not dig on the irony
and it's like they always say , if you love something give it away ! but what are you supposed to do when you love everything ? when you try to love everything
and it's like they always say - if you love something give it away ! but what are you supposed to do when when you love everything ? when you try to love everything ; when you try to love everything !
