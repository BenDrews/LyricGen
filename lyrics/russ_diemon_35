bullet in the brain
i prefer than to remain the same
bullet in the brain
i prefer than to remain the same
looking back on where we used to be
everything was clear , still i refuse to see
hearts began to rust
the diamond turned to dust
and baby took her pain all out on me
i know i share the blame for whatâ€™s in store
i was in the wrong but weren't you in it more
i let you use my gifts
to back those lying lips
i'll never know just what i did it for
