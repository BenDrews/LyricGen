put this on a zip disk , send it to your lawyer
file me under " funky "
like sipping lemonade and arnold palmers
big holiday parties like dolly padner
sometimes i get pad thai as a starter
my other order , pad see yew , is much darker
adam horovitz , i take a shvitz
i'm known for my glamour and my glitz , check it
as i bust , i really must encrust
this microphone rust with diamond fairy dust
i don't wear crocs and i don't wear sandals
the pump don't work cause the vandals took the handle
stop singing that song in the wrong key
what you looking at ? funky donkey
funky donkey
funky donkey
i - i - i - i - i go woooo - ooo like a fire engine
flashing lights to get your attention
stop sweating me about the weather
go shave a sheep and knit yourself a sweater
don't get me heated or y'all in trouble
bass is booming make the dancehall bubble
letting loose , up in the honkey tonk
with the shoopa doopa doo bedonk
well , i was swimming in the water of the ocean
like dr. jekyll with the magic potion
we're brand new , never ever the same
what's that , what's that , what's the name ?
funky donkey
