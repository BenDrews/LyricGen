scourge of lies that jealousy breeds
a plague - like human virus you ? re a breathing disease
rape or sow - harvest your hate - life is like a figure of eight
you cast first stone as your glass house grows
vicious circles in your vast deep below
poisoned tongue - retaliate - life is like a figure of eight
divide , control , conquered domain
the bitch that bred this monster must be on heat again
broken glass reflections true
pearls turn to rust - diamonds to dust
as black as coal , it ? s your silicon soul
plastic people should not play with fire
karma kills - traitors and fakes - life is like figure of eight
a small world , reap as you sow
harvest your hate , like a figure of eight
scourge , a disease , jealousy the plague it breeds
eyes , insecure blind , vicious circle of lies
