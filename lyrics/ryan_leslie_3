only somebody you love could make you feel like this
take it from somebody who knows

i'm having dreams , my vision is so elaborate
cause we went from not having to really having it
now we having it - i can't believe its happening
to think it all started from us talking and laughing and
i remember when we first met - what's your name ?
instagram snapshots in a picture frame
now what's better than anything you can think of ?
when we make love
your guiseppe high heels in a mink rug
pinot noir in a glass as we slow dance
this is romance at its best i'm dressed in brioni
you had a salad i had the rigatoni
and you told me i'm your one and only
had me feeling like a real don corleone
clark gable at the dinner table
and you my scarlett o'hara
in that dark mascara baby smile for the camera
only someone you love
could make you hurt so bad , feel like you died for a minute ( 2x )
we hold hands then we slow dance
thought we had a love affair but we broke plans
we wrote plans then we broke plans
now your heart feel crushed like a coke can
hold hands then we slow dance
thought we had a fairy tale but we broke plans
we wrote plans then we broke plans
now your heart feel crushed
so perfect in those louboutins
slow dancing with no music on
please baby be my newton - john
cause it's saturday night and i'm the new travolta
you looking so right through that lens minolta
woman of style , class , grace , taste and culture
and blessed by genetics , i meant when i said it
girl you can get it , feel good when you let it burn
