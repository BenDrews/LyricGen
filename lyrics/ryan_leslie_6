gold watch , gold chain
my independent chick be doin' her own thing
living good , she moving fast
my girl she do whatever it takes to get that cash
riding round in my old school , 68 black on black
no sleep for like 48 and thats 2 days back to back
i handle my business and i'm getting dough
racking up
i'm here for my stage show so ya'll lame dudes could start packing up
bright lights , no shade , thinking back to my broke days
i paid dues for like 6 yrs
i did dope beats for like no pay
now i'm seeing them real checks
hopping out of these enzo's
she threw it to me the first night and she kept your ass in the friend zone
sex toys , vibrate
blind fold , blind date
she do whatever i say to keep everyday like a friday
she go where ever i go
i go wherever she go
and its paparazzi when we go and thats no good for my ego
but i love it
i said i love it - yea
i love it
that's right i love it
i love it yea
i love it
i said i love it - yea
i love it
that's right i love it
look how that wrist glow
we hotter than ever , we on that crisco
you see ya boy hopping up out that enzo
that enzo
( we stuntin on these haters man )
since i came overseas , i've been opening doors
when i step on that stage , i need smoke on the floor
need them hands in the air , let the screaming occur
cuz i came in with them , but i'm leaving with her
said i took her back to my 'tel sweet
she couldn't drop clothes fast enough
she put her hands on that lead pipe and then looked at me and said thats what's up
that's cool , that's right
old school we had the best night
that jodeci that boyz ii men
that blackstreet that brian mcknight
she told me no i told her yes that's what obama said
she looked at me and said obama broke his promises
i said i'd rather be obama man he never lose
a sex tape is better than the front page of the news
feel that boom bop
drop down to the floor and do that oo wop
ain't nobody telling you stop
show me another girl that got what you got
sunk low in that new drop
when they catch you in action you know you too hot
( smokin )
yea , you know you too hot
and i don't want it any other way
