bills foreign , swiss francs
before i die , stack my money in a swiss bank
i can see right through these haters : fish tanks
plus they frowning at my watch
when i was young , i had a dream of being president
went to harvard - the best money i ever spent
graduated young - now they're saying i'm a mogul
people ask me what my address is i tell them : global
new headquarters : down wall street
went from being broke in harlem , now we all eat
twin benz trucks - call that double parked
plus every record i make is a f*ckin' work of art
i'm gettin' more money since i went independent
and they never seen me coming - had my windows tinted
the crown prince : pride of my community
and when i fly i want diplomatic immunity
my passport is stamped out - i need some pages
when i die they gon' act out my life on movie stages
got a hired gun - motto is " protect the chief "
keep these haters from scheming on this patek philippe
the campaign is global - the dollar ain't what it used to be
switch a franc for a dollar , you get like 1.3
it's too many haters , it's only one of me
and they mad cause i'm everything they wanna be
30 , 000 feet - i'm outta reach
lifestyle is extravagant , word to robin leach
on the road , homie , i ain't seen my bed in weeks
what i need a bed for ? money never sleeps !
so i don't either , i need it cash
security got a pistol it's underneath the dash
and he ain't scared to use it. i don't need to worry
you ain't got my deposit , homie , you need to hurry !
call shiv , he got my schedule it's full of dates
my life is like a recurring birthday , it's full of cake
one spot at the top that mean it's you or me
supermodel ex's ? yeah , i got 'bout 2 or 3
i can't hear a word you're sayin' now ( 4x )
cuz if you ain't talkin' bout that money
i can't hear a word you're sayin' now
said if you ain't talkin' bout that money
i can't hear a word you're sayin' now
