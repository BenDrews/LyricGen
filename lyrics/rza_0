yea , i wanna dedicate this song to my friend paul walker
up in the studio last night
writing for myself
i decided to write a song for you
peace brother
every time i think about you all i see is your smile
and your bright blue eyes
thanks for the time and the smiles
you shared with me
how you equally respected my art and talked to me
a young father just learning what it takes to be… a man
sharing time with your daughter , you had a plan
to drive in the wind , surf on the seas
realizing the love for a woman who becomes
a mother exists… and i see
how can this be ? you were set free from your worries
now you are gone in the breeze
gone in the trees
i thought we had another day to smile and laugh
in the wind , how can it end ?
i’m grateful to meet you , may we meet again
paul , my friend
on that highway
where heaven
begins
i lost a friend…
but destiny
bends , bends
but destiny bends
yea , it bends
i lost a friend
friend…
on that highway to heaven
you will drive in the wind
and you’ll surf in the seas
oh how can this be ?
you were set free from your worries
now you are gone in the breeze
gone in the trees
your soul is set free
i thought we had another day to smile and to laugh
in the wind , how can it end ?
i’m thankful to meet you , may we meet again
paul , my friend
paul , my friend
