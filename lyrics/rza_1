i could take the pitchfork from the devil
keep a super - suit like i'm incredible
from the deep blue sea to the dark blue sky
i'm the baddest man alive
i'll grab a crocodile by its tail
handcuff the judge and throw the cops in jail
make the meanest woman breakdown and cry
i'm the baddest man alive
i'm the baddest man alive
i'll take no mess and i'll take no jive
sometimes i feel like i can fly
i'm the baddest man alive
i'm the baddest man alive
not bad meaning bad , but i'm bad meaning good
say my name three times and you knock on wood
candy man hooks , i terrorize your hood
flashing mac's on a cop the way a gangsta should
i snatch food from the mouth of a tiger
take a gasoline bath then i walk through fire
bear - hug a grizzly , suck milk from her titty
take the sergeant's hat from his head and use it as a frisbee
spit in the crocodile face
have a ménage à trois with two female apes
then sleep in the barrel of butcher knives
i drank honey straight from the beehive
bungee jumping off the empire state , butt naked !
roller blade across the golden gate , butt naked !
with the baddest man alive , and i don't plan to die
when the grim reaper come , i'll look him right in his eye
i'll bust in the face of the witch of the east
tell a great white shark to go and brush his teeth , ( ha ha ha )
i'm the man who stole the golden fleece
and i date - raped beauty right in front of the beast
the baddest man alive , and i don't plan to die
i'm the baddest man alive
i'll take no mess and i'll take no jive
sometimes i feel like i can fly
i'm the baddest man alive
i'm the baddest man alive
