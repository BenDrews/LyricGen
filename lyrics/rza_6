bobby , come on baby
let's lay down and let's get some sleep ( word )
bobby.. come here baby
lay down , let's get some sleep
one two , yo , 280 grains of gun powder stuffed inside the cartridge
split ya wig , drive you off the geothal's bridge
wild like a fiend of herkimer
scholastic type brain like ivan van sertima
i've got wolves that'll murder ya for a veggie burger
spaghetti heads , meet the heavy burner
i put a oodle up in ya noodle
then i head to the dread spot for a bag of that doodoo
black photographic , i don't know no magic
but i know how to hold a 4 automatic
add a nickel to it son if you have to add it
better make sure ya kevlaar is steel padded
one flew over the cuckoo's nest , i've got beaucoup cess
get pupu from best bitches plus i shoot through vests
drive fast cars , crash bars at 5 am
stash jars of hash inside the backyard
i can't sleep like a child on christmas eve
like a tender head girl in a shop gettin' a weave
like a woman in labour about to produce the seed
or method man with playstation and an ounce of weed
some say it's hard to distinguish , my form of broken english
when spoke , the light i provide it cannot be extinguished
or eclipsed by a 1000 moons , i stay in tune
and praise the most high past the day of the doom
i squeeze black rubber grip 22 d's on the rims
squeal out , leavin' black rubber skids , other kids
couldn't match to the old pistol pete rock , beat stop
the heat pops , you better get your mother kid
this is bad news bears , like eddie munster
i keep a dragon under my stairs
plus a gun in my hat , ain't no runnin' from that
ain't no runnin' with that pack
the poison apple , dunn , i crush kings
