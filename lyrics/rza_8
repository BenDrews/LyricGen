when the earth collides
two hearts , two souls combine
one love of humankind , in heaven's name
no time for fear or blame
inside , we are the same
we feel it all , we feel the rise before the fall
although divided us , we feel it all , we feel it all
we feel it all , the rise and fall
we drift inside each other , all we have is one another
united we can never fall
the great scientist minds , militaries combined
formed the greatest weapons to defend mankind
from the bottomless pit , it's the apocalypse
egypt , okinowa , they threatened the populous
nations of man must stand its terror
two hearts ripped apart , they come together
some bonds rejoined they cannot be severed
brother , true to color , we all need each other
we look beyond these borders just to see each other
the fate of the world is upon our shoulders
a soldier tell his father goodbye , you can see the proudness
a gleam of hope appears in his eye
no one knows for whom the bell tolls
a strong might body , hundred tons of steel
kaiju , facing the enemy that stands before us
we feel it all , they're trying to destroy us !
we drift inside each other , all we have is one another
united we can never fall
