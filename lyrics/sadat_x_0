i will never spit on a mantan jam
but damn , pharoahe's that nigga though
slam these bitches like bam bam bigelow
critically acclaimed , physically main
literally the shit - - you the shitstain
i spit insane , get brain , you switch lanes
you itch - bay made , i flip lames like judo
or karate , then slow it down like promethazine
king musabi from queens
in fact , queens' idi amin
fuck serato , for wax and cds i fiend
escalate like schindler , elevate like otis
minus the mescaline
if you questioning who the goat is
focus on where you vocal to note i'm the most devoted
nobody's equivalent , more quoted
pharoahe's the lowest
common denominator when i'm rhyming
in fact , i'm the quotient
this is our way
this is everything we are
this is our place
you could never get involved , this is our thing
this is our dream
legacy is what i leave for my offspring
walking with my head held high
educated , i could build with the gods
plus i got that fly delivery
don't ever be surprised that they feeling me
keep your eye on the sparrow
keep your eye on the pharoahe
more bone - crushing than marrow
the menace cousin harold
the bradys tom and carol
hades def apparel
jump the falls in a barrel
the cowboy is ending now , boy
the when and how , boy
the off - roaded , decoded by none
" girlies , rub your titties " was said by son
chop the head then it's done , no bread by the gun
more enormous than pun
in human form , it's the one
through the light stress , life vest , tight chest breathing
i'm good , you believing
i should keep achieving
pull something from the sleeve and brought it out on rainy days
like green granny haze
expands from my grays , demands better days
your mans love the phrase
plan , never phase
fried , bouillabaisse
fricasseed or sauteed
chef roble
glad y'all stayed , let the beat slay
born on the day that mary prayed
y'all know what she made - - the modern jesus
we too made caesar
