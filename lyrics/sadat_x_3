someone close to you , someone you love dearly

fight that battle every day
thirteen percent of all human death

cancer is the great imitator
sometimes it reveals itself much later

it don't discriminate
it don't discriminate

cancer of the colon and the prostate
you need to get yourself straight
cancer of the lungs is rising
the first thing you do in the morning is buy a loose
it feel like a boost
it's a threat in that skinny cigarette
exposed to asbestos in the air
in that jail , they wasn't playing fair
shit was everywhere
that's why i lost two brothers that year

so we can cure our loved ones
