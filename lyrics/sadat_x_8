yeah , where the ladies at , where the ladies at ?
check it out , this is for all the ladies out there
with the lump lump , holding it down
running scams , turning tricks , playing players
i'm telling you , you need to snap out of it , know what i'm saying ?
what the deal big mama , body like drama
other than her mind her penny's short of a dime
sherita doing rita , slick moving senorita
give her two margaritas , she's the big willie beater
head to two fashion , love gear with a passion
never going out looking slum , i say word she is , son
nice lump lump , big chest caught me staring
stretch the d and the y of a shirt of donna karen
she's a schemer , cherry red 52 - 8 beemer
been out bar hopping an it ain't no stopping
i'm checking out the way that this chicken motivates
spread legs , waist , and eggs up and down the tri - state
*woah here she comes* , dig get done
i'm a hit her with a clue and tell her see frank perdue
cause i keep my erection out the poultry section
cause the wrong interjection might lead to infection
it be trees and cheese then bend the knees
long a nigga keep paper then it's yours with ease
i know the whole of the half cause i deal with math
quick to run that ass just to ride us class
" i've been doing my own thing " ( repeat 2x )
yeah i've seen you at the african street fest
dressed in three fourth to your ankles
tight wrapped skirt , what can that hurt ?
you was buying books giving flirtatious looks
at the brothers that was eyeing your equipment
light skinned pigment , pierced the belly button
and you couldn't tell her nothing
said she loved a man with dreads
and wasn't impressed with the name brand threads
are you seeing through our gameplan ?
sex every night , but never with the same man
a freak for the knowledge , your first week in college
you was sneaking brothers in the dorm
and lost your mind when you got your pad off campus
all the time keeping up the facade , you like to fuck with the gods
now you stuck between a rock and a hard place
faced with the facts that your acts are a detriment , to what you represent
can't be a chicken and act like the science you kicking
mad niggas be sticking , licking fingers after ever meal
now she want singers with a deal
i'm only bringing you the real , no matter what i say
you gonna do what you feel
" i've been doing my own thing " ( repeat 2x )
yeah , yeah , yeah
i had seen this chick at the bar , ? ? ? he was thirst
the physical was there but mentally she was the worst
walked around with her ass out and her glass out
of her hand , she sees nothing , my man
ask her world topics , has she been to the tropics
with this cat she hardly know , scott larock " super ho "
most likely to have a baby from a cat alone lover
is that your wifey man ? no that's my baby mother
you arrive at the pop of a cork , like a hawk
stay around , chitter chatter , and make small talk
get figety and then you walk
and you wonder why i drag your name through new york
with the velcro cup that's stuck to your fingers
searching out the drug dealers and the fly looking singers
getting passed like a blunt , but in the club you front
you insist that you ain't been twist by ? hevenies ?
niggas are you crazy , i got the figures and the numbers
don't lie , save your bullshit , don't try to be fly
live as you live and have a good life
but a chick like that can't make a good wife
these words i say might cut like a knife
but i'm only trying to save you stress and strife
" i've been doing my own thing " ( repeat 4x )
