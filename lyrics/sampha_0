calculate indecision
can't cradle fear no more
bear the shame of the incision
all lain cold across the floor
your heart pounds with precision
a king dies inside his courts
your heart pounds with precision
a king dies inside these doors
let it all work out , let it all work out
let it all work out , let it all work out
let it all work out , let it all work out
let it all work out , let it all work out
i don't mind your tongue inhibition
throw us against the wall
mistakes of your broke vision
it's harder to let them go
from the orifice of wisdom
my answers don't hear their calls
laugh and leave with what you know
but the pain won't subside at all
let it all work out , let it all work out
let it all work out , let it all work out
let it all work out , let it all work out
let it all work out , let it all work out
the flood of noise , faith in the wise of heart
and the moon protects the moon projects
a light on everything we said
flood of noise , buried in the words i've heard
and as the moon protects , the moon projects
a light on everything we saidâ€”work out
let it all work out , let it all work out
let it all work out , let it all work out
let it all work out , let it all work out
let it all work out , let it all work out
