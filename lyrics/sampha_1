i see you in the dark
'cause i've been where you are
you're too scared show me love
'cause too fresh with the scars
well i don't have the answers
so i won't tell you lies
you were there when i was down , love
but you gotta live your own life
she said i can't let this happen
no , i can't let this happen again
i found my love and i
i don't wanna lose it again
and i , i told you all my secrets , lover
no , i
i don't want to have to speak to another , my dear
and i , i find it hard to fully trust you
and i
i'm staring at this multi - colored cluster of lust and love
she said i can't let this happen
no , i can't let this happen again
i found my love and i
i don't wanna lose it again
and i , i value all that we discover
we set free , we set free those emotions left uncovered , my dear
an echo , an echo of our time stands before us
her eyes , ears , and her mouth
she looks just like you , my dear
i said i can't let this happen
i can't let this happen again
i found my love and i
i don't wanna lose it again
i said i can't let this happen
i can't let this happen again
i found my love and i
i don't wanna lose it again
no , i don't wanna lose you now
no , i don't wanna lose you now
no , i don't wanna lose you now
no , i don't wanna lose you now
no , i don't wanna lose you now
no , i don't wanna lose you now
no , i don't wanna lose you now
no , i don't wanna lose you now
