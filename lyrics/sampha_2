i'll work my way over into the sunlight here without looking directly into the sun
magnetic light in the blue - high haze
a magnifying glass upon my face
it's so hot i've been melting out here
i'm made out of plastic out here
you touched down in the base of my fears
houston , can - can - can you hear ?
and we both had to harness our pain
close it and hope it decays
oh , inhale and i'm up and away
up and away
i love those mornings , when the sun's up
smoking in the lobby , waiting for my name to pop up , yeah , pop up
usually i'd run home , and tuck the issue under
oh , sleeping with my worries , yeah , i didn't really know what that lump was , my luck
it's so hot i've been melting out here
i'm made out of plastic out here
you touched down in the base of my fears
and that's when your beauty appears
it's so hot i've been melting out here
i'm made out of plastic out here
you touched down in the base of my fears
houston , can - can - can you hear me now ?
you dare know what the scarecrow hears
it's like outer space in his inner ears
and like a blossom you opened up
and understood why you could not love , oh
it's so hot i've been melting out here
i'm made out of plastic out here
you touched down in the base of my fears
houston , can - can - can you hear ?
i've been melting , melting down here
i'm made out of plastic out here
you touched down in the base of my fears
houston , can - can - can you hear me now ?
i'll work my way over into the sunlight here without looking directly into the sun
sky high deflating ideas
thriving of your lessons and yes you are my lantern
a shy light curves around my ears
the more you speak , the more i see
the more your lights grows upon me
and the more it grows , the closer i think you are , the closer i think you are
to seeing me whole
what if you don't like what you see , silhouettes inside a dream
and i'm melting from the light
one drip at a time
( two four two zero )
i'm melting from the light
one drip , one drip at a time
i think you're pulling the wrong one
i'm just...okay. i'm ready to pull it down now
