see , i don’t wanna say you've got me
see , i don’t wanna say you've got me
i’m just glad that you’re here , here , here
i see mountains and mountains are close
so i’m searching here , i'm searching for love
only good it’s not into , the only good it’s not unfair
yeah , yeah—
just say it , say it , say it , say it , say it
see we don’t have to go
we don’t have to go without
without , without without
just say it , say it , say it , say it
say it , won’t you say ?
well , i’m far from perfect
i see the pictures that you take
the darkness in your days don't change , they don't change
but i’m saying , saying , saying , saying won’t you stay ?
you need somebody that comes along to say
that you are going to be ok , ok , ok , ok
well i'll say , say , say , say it
i can’t stay forever , but if this would go straight
i conquered the catastrophe
oh , without you , oh , without you
oh , without you , oh , without you
oh , without you , oh , without you
oh without you , oh without you
so just say it , just say
that we don't have to go
we don't have to go without , without
i'll say , say , say , say it , oh i'll say
