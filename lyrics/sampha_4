no one knows me like the piano in my mother's home
you would show me i had something some people call a soul
and you dropped out the sky , oh you arrived when i was three years old
no one knows me like the piano in my mother's home
you know i left , i flew the nest
and you know i won't be long
and in my chest you know me best
and you know i'll be back home
an angel by her side , all of the times i knew we couldn't cope
they said that it's her time , no tears in sight , i kept the feelings close
and you took hold of me and never , never , never let me go
'cause no one knows me like the piano in my mother's home
in my mother's home
