don't think about it too much , too much , too much , too much
there's no need for us to rush this through
don't think about it too much , too much , too much , too much
this is more than just a new lust for you
i… i…
feel like you're by my side
laying upside down
clouds upon clouds
and you're on my mind
oh i…
don't think about it too much , too much , too much , too much
there's no need for us to rush this through
don't think about it too much , too much , too much , too much
this is more than just a new lust for you
i… i…
don't give up
when your heart stop
and you tell me that you care ! that you care !
don't give up
when your heart stop
and you tell me something's gone wrong
whole hearted , whole hearted
you care , i know you care about me
you care about me
i know you care about me
i know you do
oh i…
don't think about it too much , too much , too much , too much
there's no need for us to rush this through
don't rush it through
don't think about it too much , too much , too much , too much
