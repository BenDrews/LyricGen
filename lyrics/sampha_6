if ever you're listening
if ever you're listening
if ever you're listening
if ever you're listening
if heaven's a prison
then i am your prisoner
yes , i am your prisoner
i messed up , ooh
i know now
there's no room for me to play now
nowhere to dig my way out
my vital organs are beating through
my ribcage opened , my heart ballooned
i... i've lost another one
i'm on the floor trying to dress my wounds
address the fact it was mine to lose
i... i didn't try enough
and when i'm left without your love
it could feel like a lifetime baby
and somewhere in the start we had it alright
sunshine and blue skies , yes i recall
but now there's a darker blue
i'm bleeding and you don't care
the sun sinks and you're not there
if ever you're listening
if heaven's a prison
then i am your prisoner
yes , i am your prisoner
i messed up , ooh
i know now
there's no room for me to play now
nowhere to dig my way out
my brother always said i'm a dreamer , dreamer
you better watch out where this life will lead ya
and he always said she's a keeper keeper
she'll stay by your side when the rest will leave ya
well i'm looking on my left side , i'm looking on my right
she's nowhere to be seen now when i close my eyes at night
dreaming , surely you will find me by the shore
i'm singing so blindly , can you hear me ?
can you find me ?
if you find me , wanna tell you i love you so
i wanna tell you that love comes and goes
that it comes and goes
i hear the footsteps in the water and i feel the breeze
i open my eyes and no words , no words...
i wish that i listened when i was in prison
now i'm just a visitor
i came to the gates but you turned me away
you asked me what am i waiting for
i'm waiting 'cause i fucked up , ooh
i got thrown out
i don't know which way to go now
don't know which way is home now
if ever you're listening
if heaven's a prison
then i am your prisoner
yes , i am your prisoner
i messed up , oh
i know now
there's no room for me to play now
nowhere to dig my way out
