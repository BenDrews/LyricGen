ayy , oh , i am , ayy , oh , i
grey hoodies , they cover their heads
i can't see their faces
i can't see , see , see , see , see
they knew me
look , sweat on my head
my heart's thumpin' , drummin'
no need , no need to take from me
don't throw the paint on me
i see this lake formin'
i got lost astray
in this forest runnin' away
i slip up , i'm on the edge now
they see me , and i nearly
i nearly lose my grip , but you held on to me
and you shake me , and tell me that i'm okay , but
i swear they smell the blood on me
i hear them coming for me
i swear they smell the blood on me
i hear them coming for me , for me
i wake up and the sky's blood red
i'm still heavy breathin'
felt so much more than dreamin'
i get up , they're at the edge of my bed
yeah , how did they find me , find me ?
they said there's somethin' bleedin' in me
somethin' screamin' in me
somethin' buried deep beneath
well i need to , need to get away
so i get it , steal this get - away
and i accelerate , and i accelerate
but my gears got stuck
i'm on this road now
i'm so alone now , swervin' out of control now
and i crash the whip
and this tree flew through me
arms out , you pull me
and wipe my wounds clean
i swear they smell the blood on me
i hear them coming for me
i swear they smell the blood on me
i hear them coming for me , for me
ayy , oh , i am , ayy , oh , i am
ayy , oh , i am , ayy , oh , i am
ayy , oh , i am , ayy , oh , i am
ayy , oh , i am , ayy , oh , i am
ayy , oh , i am , ayy , oh , i am
ayy , oh , i am , ayy , oh , i am
ayy , oh , i am , ayy , oh , i am
ayy , oh , i am , ayy , oh , i am
i swear they smell the blood on me
i hear them coming for me
i swear they smell the blood on me
i hear them coming for me , for me
