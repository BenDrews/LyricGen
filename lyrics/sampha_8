there's a fault in my structure
it's always you and never me
i threw the blame and it shattered
and now there's broken glass praying to be healed
you struck a chord and i listened
you damn near broke all the strings
when you get close , i get distant
instead i'll drive away to a place surreal
and tell me how that feels
took the brake pads out the car
and i flew
smashed this window in my heart
and i blamed you
this anger's taking me apart
explosive truths
except this time i went too far
and i hurt you
i wish i could take it back right now
where's that smile when it matters ?
where was i when you called ?
i shot the blame and it scattered
now there's bullet holes spread across the walls
i took the shape of a letter
slipped myself underneath your door
in this red room we develop
an understanding of all our wrongs
now can we move along ?
took the brake pads out the car
and i flew
smashed this window in my heart
and i blamed you
this anger's taking me apart
explosive truths
except this time i went too far
and i hurt you
i wish i could take it back right now
