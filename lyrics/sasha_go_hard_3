i'm coming up from the bottom , my mentality is " fuck 'em "
got this money coming out tho , on a pretty little model
snatch ya' man , he broke a bin , he popping tags like he a column
i'm hungry so i be eating , no nigga living i'm needing
i pray , just shout out to god , hate them bitches , get that a lot
no friction , keep it 100 , these bitches begging for promo
i'm headed to the uk , i ain't local , ho , i am global
they love you , then they diss you
i'm the shit , go get the tissue
get hundreds in my wallet , pop a bill without a pistol
he eat me then he kiss you , my pussy in his visual

i think i'm a problem , i think i'm a problem
treat bitches like crickets , i hear 'em but don't acknowledge 'em
basic bitches follow like scientists through a fossil print
i'm beasty with these lyrics , i'm crazy and this ain't medical
i might just take your nigga , he chewing me like i'm adderall
i don't want his numba' , he tryna' to holla with zero's
these bitches ain't got no hobby , man they watching me like some vevo
he branded me like a scholar , he graduated with honors
i never could trust a bitch cause they snaky like two piranhas
that's a problem
i don't think that they feel me like novocain
that bitch is messy , if she throwing dirt up on my name
i'ma clean it up as if my first name carlton
these rappers are my kids now add the g cause i'm your guardian
i think i'm a problem , take your nigga , bitch , i rob ya
i'm hot ho , like some lava , skinny pretty bitch , a model
i think i'm a problem , take your nigga , bitch , i rob ya'
i'm hot ho , like some lava , skinny pretty bitch , a model
i think i'm a problem , i think i'm a problem
i think i'm a problem , i think i'm a problem
