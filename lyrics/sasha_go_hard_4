i like my niggas body full of tats
how he talk , how he walk , how he act
swag mean counting stacks in the back
i like it how i swag with my flow
get my own bread , then i cop some more
how the ass drop when i hit the floor
bread first , drama last
i'm a real chick , i don't kiss ass
real bitches get real money
fake hoes don't make money
if you got them mad , shoot them down
every girl in the game want to take the crown
friendships don't need that
real love , don't believe in that
my whole side don't chitchat
them the ones that get quick snatched
got a phone call
im on my way
he got a beat ready for sgh
my team's small , no baseball
her hubby through my call log
throw it back , fall back
hating on me fuck all y'all
a lot of niggas they say i'm weak
when they see me , they quick to speak
when they talking they ain't loud enough
same boys that playing tough
game her , stay in your lane
i'll leave your heart down full of pain
got them stuck like a picture frame
beat the face up red paint
you know my name , you know what i do
i'm * money , bitch how about you
i do what i want , i don't have to stunt
i'm solo and dolo
he rocking that polo
i'm ready you know , i'm down for sure
you can drop down to the floor
rachet it though , you silly hoe
there's the door , you got to go
i like a nigga on the grind
getting money all the time
when he with me show me love
pay attention and he fine
counting money when he out
talking about it , what about
if a bumb try to doubt
punch him dead in his mouth
he got a cross on his chest
with some words on the left
bad motherfucker swagged out gucci belt
got these niggas on my bumper
run up i will thump her
bitches stand tall , don't fall or i stomp her
i walk up in the party and a bunch of bitches mugging
i'm guessing because they are mad
pockets small , like a button
schooling bitches i'm the captain , line up don't butting
spending my money , spend your niggas money like it nothing
this exactly what i do
buy me ae and jimmy choo
make me smile like i'm a child
definition of the truth
talking to me , who are you ?
f - u - c - k y - o - u
pussy sweeter than that sweet
like its berry
