it was bout 12 : 30 in the am
got a call from my bestfriend kaylen
told me that i need to come like asap
so i hopped in the coupe , gone no waiting
did a hundred on the dash , yes took flight
no smile on my face cause something wasn't right
it's a weekend night and my man ain't here
pull up , get out and my friend came near
she said ; girl you won't believe it , ima let you see it
we walked in the club , niggas showing dubs
we ain't even get searched cause i'm coo with the plug
see a lot of thugs g'd up all white
strippers in the club shaking ass all night
walked through the crowd bum hoes wanna fight , but i dare a hoe to try , i'll smack a bitch like ike
we walked to back , seen my girl shay
spoke to the bitch she ain't have nun to say
every three or four minutes , she ain't never throw shade
had me thinking like damn what the fuck , anyways
turned to the left looked at my girl kay
then looked down cause the look on her face
can't believe this the game he played
saw my man holding hands with shay
niggas ain't shit , niggas ain't that , niggas ain't this
niggas will say that they love you , kiss on you and hug you , but be with a bitch
niggas ain't shit , niggas ain't shit
these niggas ain't shit , niggas ain't shit
niggas ain't shit , niggas ain't that , niggas ain't this
niggas will say that they love you , kiss on you and hug you , but be with a bitch
niggas ain't shit , you niggas ain't shit
niggas ain't shit , these niggas ain't shit
stepped out the club , ain't wanna catch a case
niggas so stuck , yeah it's all in his face
told me he was out with his guys
he ain't even have to lie , lied dead to my motherfucking face
knew it from the start that the bitch that was hating
bitches ain't shit , they'll smile in ya face but pretend , be friends with ya man , wanna smoke , wanna fuck , wanna link , wanna be in your place
while i'm getting money he fucking with bitches
he thinking it's funny , like ima stay with you
you play with my heart , ima play with your visual
get someone better i bet i dismiss you
she can have you , i don't need shit
competition , i don't really see shit
even though it hurt you gon be sick
when you see me with another nigga you gon be pissed
niggas will treat they main girl like they nun
just to get out here and have them some fun
then say she tripping when she say she done
how we together when it feel like one
but it's cool ima fall back
ima block every number don't call back
but it's cool ima fall back
ima block every number don't call back
niggas ain't shit , niggas ain't that , niggas ain't this
niggas will say that they love you , kiss on you and hug you , but be with a bitch
niggas ain't shit , niggas ain't shit
these niggas ain't shit , niggas ain't shit
niggas ain't shit , niggas ain't that , niggas ain't this
niggas will say that they love you , kiss on you and hug you , but be with a bitch
niggas ain't shit , you niggas ain't shit
niggas ain't shit , these niggas ain't shit
