have you ever felt alone ?
like no one ever cared if you was here or you was gone
when no one else was there
when you was there they did you wrong
stuck in a cell
no air
no phone
gotta be strong gotta get back home
like everyone around you don't really care they just down you
if it don't benefit 'em they'll clown you
they'll down you
have you ever felt alone ? ( x2 )
nobody is perfect i give my baby what she want she deserve it
can't let em knock you.. look in the mirror that's all who can stop you
tryna do right in a world full of wrong gotta catch that flight cause ya time ain't long
when you get home tell me you gon do right
imma go hard for the team on my life
have you ever felt like no one gave a fuck ?
don't know who to love
don't know who to trust
don't know who be with you just to get a buck
it's crazy you'll do anything for anybody , but when it gets dark you there by yourself
just a little help , probably
everybody not with you
when you fall , they gon forget you
just know who gon be with you
when it's time , who gon come get you ?
its sad to be alone just know this ain't a song i'm riding with you even if you wrong
have you ever felt alone ?

being alone don't mean you alone just know that somebody is here
when you feeling like no one is near
get on your knees and pray that he clear
everything that you fear
dealing with situations from the rear
getting impatient waiting for a ear
somebody to listen somebody to care
wish i was there
but you gotta do what you gotta do
stay true to yourself til your last breath
keep your head up when you're feeling fed up
you don't want to be broke get your bread up
if you waiting on the money get your legs up
in the streets of chi - raq you fed us
nothing but hate and fake at matter , not what's up
sometimes it feel like that the world finna end
like i ain't got no family
ain't got no friends
sometimes it feel like that the world finna end
like i ain't got no family
ain't got no friends
