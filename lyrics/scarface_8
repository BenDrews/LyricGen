''blood gushing , i think i hear sirens''
chiefing on that , think i hear my heart beat
smoking , got me rolling stogies on a dark street
let's jack this nigga cause he got some shit we can't afford
another day in gary , 'nother couple niggas in the morgue
he got the beating , his weed crumbs on plush seats
niggas wanna hate , they get yellow tape'd and white sheets
and he steady talking , my chopper , he gonna let it rip
all the bullets that got my name on 'em still in the clip
life's a bitch , i was a virgin , hope she let me fuck
pray i miss before a nigga bust his last nut
homie '84 got the same rims that mine had
freddie jumped up in it like freshman year with the dime bags
i started small time , dope game , cocaine
pulling stick ups to the nigga from a no name
diamond bezel , went from pebbles to a whole thing
now them punk detectives in my section know my whole name
gibbs , nigga
