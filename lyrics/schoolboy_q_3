what is life for a nigga like me ?
living out his backpack every night
needed a new place to sleep
but this is now , nigga
one's for the money , two for the bitches
three to get ready cause i feel i finally did it
four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
turn that mothafucka to a critic
man , i got so much shit up on my plate , dog
i was hanging on them corners late
pockets wasn't straight , bitch
i ain't gon' make it at this rate , dog , know what i'm saying ?
nigga praying up to god just hoping that he hear a nigga
i know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
but i figured , i'd get some shit up off my chest
to all my niggas i would die for , load my pistol up , go out and war for
to all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
fuck it , keep goin' hard , don't let 'em see you weak
to all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
read a book and exercise , keep your spirit in
to all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
take our hats off , bow our heads and let us pray , just wanna say
stay blessed my nigga , blessed my nigga
really think about it , could be worse my nigga
don't stress my nigga , yes , my nigga
we all blessed my nigga
now how the fuck i'm 'posed to say this ?
you see my nigga just lost his son
while i'm here hugging on my daughter , i grip her harder
kiss her on the head as i cry for a bit
thinking of some bullshit to tell him
like " it'll be okay , you'll be straight , it'll be aight "
well , fuck that shit
whatever you need , yo , i got it !
whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
fuck it , then i'm riding
you know what's up , but now a nigga couldn't stick around
told myself that after y'all moved
that i'd be a fuckin' fool , to be living by the street rules
" fuck police " tattoos , that happens when you ditch school
but anyway , keep the faith
stay strong , bruh , remain solid , bruh
keep playing ball , cuz
it's the only way up out it , bruh , a nigga proud of ya
tell floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
i'll have whatever he needs , we the last of a dying breed
live life , smoke trees
see how far we've come but most , i'm sorry for your son
and you ain't gotta shed no tear
i'll be everywhere and i'mma always be right here
i ain't forgot those years
i'll be everywhere but i'mma always be right here
living in a premature place... wait
never grow to see the pearly gates... break
every time a bullet detonate... dates... of obituary carry crates
of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
in december you was finna pin another case
on your record in a stolen expedition , play it safe
as the record spinning , you was hearing angels entertain
every pun intended , that was wicked , coming from your brain
recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
that's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
story of a gun - clapper really tryna make a change
everybody ain't blessed , my nigga
yes , my nigga , you're blessed , take advantage , do your best , my nigga
don't stress , you was granted everything inside this planet
anything you imagine , you possess , my nigga
you reject these niggas that neglect your respect
for the progress of a baby step , my nigga
step - step my nigga , one , two , skip - skip
back - back , look both ways , pull it off the hip
blast at anybody say that you can't flip
this crack into rap music every other zip is a track
get used to it , get it off quick
come back , give back to the city you've built
that's that , don't trip , see money , fuck niggas , dog
it ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas , dog
in a minute everybody gon' be winning
put a little faith in it then recognize that we all
