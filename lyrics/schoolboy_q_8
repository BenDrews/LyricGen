speeding through the yellow lights
treat my versace belt like it's a mistletoe
i put everything over yellow rice , graduated from hella ice
if i stand on my bank roll ( stand on your bank roll ) , nigga , i'd be scared of heights
and i'd be dodging the police , when i was poor with no lights
when i was poor with potential , watch my flow in four inches
oh lord , she in christians , all gold for my adventist
pulled it down and she kissed it , all gold where my wrists is
god'll judge , no conviction
just because i got dreads don't get it twisted
moving my whip down the boulevard
word round town , i was selling hard
hard and i'm talking bout the yayo
hit her on the floor and then i lay low
amigos say " que pasa with the pesos ? "
promethazine codeine , caseloads ( t.r.u. )
and when i pull up to the valet , you know i got the strippers on payroll !
