there used to be a graying tower alone on the sea
you became the light on the dark side of me
love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill
but did you know
that when it snows
my eyes become large and
the light that you shine can't be seen
baby , i compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
ooh , the more i get of you
the stranger it feels , yeah
and now that your rose is in bloom
a light hits the gloom on the gray
there is so much a man can tell you
so much he can say
you remain
my power , my pleasure , my pain , baby
to me you're like a growing addiction that i can't deny
won't you tell me is that healthy , baby ?
but did you know
that when it snows
my eyes become large and
the light that you shine can't be seen
baby , i compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
ooh , the more i get of you
the stranger it feels , yeah
and now that your rose is in bloom
a light hits the gloom on the gray
i've been kissed by a rose on the gray
i , i've been kissed by a rose on the gray
i've ... ( and if i should fall along the way ) ... been kissed by a rose on the gray
i , i've been kissed by a rose on the gray
there is so much a man can tell you
so much he can say
you remain
my power , my pleasure , my pain
to me you're like a growing addiction that i can't deny , yeah
won't you tell me is that healthy , baby
