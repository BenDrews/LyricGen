this won't no tumbler love
this won't no fb neither
girl u were my sickness
i call it jungle fever
your body it was so contagious
had me floating to you when i smelt that fragrance
i hit the jackpot like playin slots in vegas
late night talks we had the deepest conversations
i was so deep in you you , you spoke a different tongue
and when we were done you said your mind was numb
you were my cinderella and nights still young
so we can do whatever until the time comes
are you nervous ? your heart's beating like drums
i wanna get between thighs until the sunrise
and we don't stop until the sun drops
