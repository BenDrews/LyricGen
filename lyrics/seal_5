do you ever feel , like your through air ?
that time stood still all that you do is wrong ?
remember this , when you’re down in despair and you bleed
you don’t want care but you need me to be your friend
love helps us love
love helps us feel
love finds imaginary and then makes it real
love picks you up
love sets you free
open your arms and be loved by me
do you ever feel , you’re just making it by ?
and you can’t so you try for relief in another’s eyes , yeah
remember this , sometimes the only way up is to crawl
you’re already down you can’t fall anymore
cos love helps us love
love helps us deal
love finds imaginary and then makes it real
love picks you up
love sets you free
open your arms and be loved by me
don’t you know it’s a game of give and take
don’t you know it’s just something we can’t fake
if i had a piece for you to take then it would be that
love only makes you strong
( and it would be that )
love makes you heal
( and it could be that )
love only hates with love with love with love with love with love
give me your hands i can feel for you
open your heart i can heal for you
give me a sign i will reach for you
open your arms and be loved
open your arms and be loved
by me
by me
by me
