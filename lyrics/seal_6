like a fool i went and stayed too long
now i'm wondering if your love's still strong
oo , baby , here i am , signed , sealed , delivered , i'm yours !
then that time i went and said goodbye
now i'm back and not ashamed to cry
oo , baby , here i am , signed , sealed , delivered , i'm yours !
here i am baby
signed , sealed , delivered , i'm yours
( you got my future in your hands )
here i am baby
signed , sealed , delivered , i'm yours
( you got my future in your hands )
i've done a lot of foolish things
that i really didn't mean , didn't i ?
seen a lot of things in this old world
when i touch them , they mean nothing , girl
oo , baby , here i am , signed , sealed , delivered , i'm yours !
oowee baby , you set my soul on fire
that's why i know you're my heart's only desire
here i am baby
signed , sealed , delivered , i'm yours
( you got my future in your hands )
here i am baby
signed , sealed , delivered , i'm yours
( you got my future in your hands )
