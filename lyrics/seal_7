in a church , by the face
he talks about the people going under
only child know
a man decides after seventy years
that what he goes there for is to unlock the door
while those around him criticize and sleep
and through a fractal on a breaking wall
i see you my friend , and touch your face again
miracles will happen as we trip
but we're never gonna survive , unless
we get a little crazy
no we're never gonna survive , unless
we are a little crazy
crazy yellow people walking through my head
one of them's got a gun , to shoot the other one
and yet together they were friends at school
ohh , get it , get it , get it , get it no no
if all were there when we first took the pill
then maybe , then maybe , then maybe , then maybe
miracles will happen as we speak
but we're never gonna survive , unless
we get a little crazy
no we're never gonna survive , unless
we are a little crazy
no no , never survive , unless we get a little bit
oh darlin'
in a sky full of people , only some want to fly
isn't that crazy
in a world full of people , only some want to fly
isn't that crazy , crazy
in a heaven of people there's only some who want to fly
ain't that crazy , oh babe , oh darlin'
in a world full of people there's only some want to fly
isn't that crazy , isn't that crazy , isn't that crazy , isn't that crazy
oh , but we're never gonna survive , unless
we get a little crazy
no we're never gonna survive , unless
we are a little crazy
but we're never gonna survive , unless
we get a little crazy
no we're never gonna survive , unless
we are a little crazy
no , no we're never gonna survive , unless
we are a little bit
and then you see things
the size of which you've never known before
they'll break it
someday , only child know
them things
the size of which you've never known before someday
