sold my soul and signed my name in blood
stole it back , now praying in the dark
fooled the devil , begging for a fight
count the dollars , make your bet tonight
feel strong like an oiled machine , all the anger boils within
move it , give in , the high rollers are in
i get groovy now turn it on and fight
seal the deal , and let's boogie for a while
let's get groovy , burning out with rage
seal the deal , and let's do it all again
knuckles crushed , my eyes no longer see
i paid the price , and fed the family
feel strong like an oiled machine , all the anger boils within
move it , give in , the high rollers are in
i get groovy now turn it on and fight
seal the deal , and let's boogie for a while
let's get groovy , burning out with rage
seal the deal , and let's do it all again
sing hallelujah , the devil in disguise
there'll be no pearly gates , so stand up for yourself this time
fight for honor , let no one drag you down no more
be your own man , with blood , sweat , tears you fall
i get groovy now turn it on and fight
seal the deal , and let's boogie for a while
let's get groovy , burning out with rage
seal the deal , and let's do it all again
