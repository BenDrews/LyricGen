see the curtains hangin' in the window
in the evening on a friday night
a little light a - shinin' through the window
lets me know everything's all right
summer breeze makes me feel fine
blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
summer breeze makes me feel fine
blowin' though the jasmine in my mind
see the paper layin' on the sidewalk
a little music from the house next door
so i walk on up to the doorstep
through the screen and across the floor
sweet days of summer , the jasmine's in bloom
july is dressed up and playing her tune
and i come home from a hard day's work
and you're waitin' there
not a care in the world
see the smile awaitin' in the kitchen
through cookin' and the plates for two
feel the arms that reach out to hold me
in the evening when the day is through
