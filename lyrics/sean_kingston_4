ah !
well this ah di big bod nicki minaj ( kingston ! )
and dem should know ! ( jr ! we back. )
i was just a player in the game of love
'til she came and turned mi tables around
stacking up mi chips lining up all mi cars
still they all came tumbling down
man i think i might , think i might make her the one
take them stealin' me up on the run
she hits me like a shot gun , i’m done
if love is the beat she’s the stead of my drum
fly me away , the kingdom come
she got me going , daram - dam - daram - dam
hey - o , hey - o , i was born to be wild
oh no , oh no , 'til love shot me down
i’d rather die a thousand times , than live without your love
i'm sayin , hey - o , hey - o , i was born to be wild
oh no , oh no 'til you came around
i’d rather die a thousand times , than live without your love
hey - o , hey - o , i was born to be wild
love was just a word 'til i bought me a ballah
oh you everything for holding me down
i'm tellin all my homies that mi find mi a queen
in the jungle so you facing the crowd
if you would die , then why would you try
and if you reply , a suit and a tie
is what i would buy , then you will be mine
because you and i , we're born to be wild
i am martha ; you king arthur , who knew you would land me ?
i've been known to eat these rappers , cook 'em like chef ramsey
mission accomplished , you're my accomplice
cover of vogue , yeah , i'mma go topless
i'mma go bonkers i'mma go crazy
i'mma get reckless and have a baby
then hang the baby off of the balcony
teachin him to moon walk , tell him he's japanese
yeahhh ! ! ( konichiwa ! )
