i need it in the summertime , oh
i need it in the wintertime , oh
i need it in the spring or fall
get you wet in your drawers
like i should , you've got that that seasonal love
met her at kod - said she get off at 3
i'mma be right back - pick her up in my new v
girl , you've got that good - good , i can't even lie
i ain't even tripping' , girl , i know i am that guy
girl don't hold back - pull up , throw these racks
show money , no tax - young gun , just like that
pour it , pour it up cause all i see is dollar signs
givenchy embalm me , and my crib stay so fly
she say bands make her dance , money make her cum
bring me a couple of bottles and 20 , 000 ones
she say bands make her dance , money make her cum
but girl , i ain't tripping cause you've got that seasonal love
look , couple feelings , she caught 'em
summer feelings , not autumn
i'm cold baby , i'm a winter
spring out of your garments
rain down in your lower
cause i'm up there like i'm polar
i could be the love of your life
or i could fuck you like i don't know ya
all these chicks around don't really understand
just say i could hold you down , don't really need no hand
cause she move quick , elusive with no frontin'
don't mean to beg or borrow , but i've got a little somethin'
damn girl , do you really understand that you
you've got that seasonal love ?
damn girl , do you really understand that you
you've got that seasonal love ?
damn girl , do you really understand that you
you've got that seasonal love ?
damn girl , do you really understand that you
you've got that seasonal love ?
