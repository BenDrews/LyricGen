i don't want to dougie , i just want money
studied under the understudy the one - twenty
young dummies can't spar
no life , my flow tight , like your pants are
you don't got a chance , pa , ansaar community
malachi york fricasse , yo fuck a eulogy
fuck jewelry ; what jewelry
i took this from another rapper
slapped him with the toolie , g
cornball rappers , i see you on bet
relieved of their jewelry , interview beef dvd
p tnt , the flow dynamite
niggas so - so , bozos ain't rhyming right
i hit a line of white , i smoke a dub of green
niggas call it purple , what the fuck you mean
fuck a fistfight , i'm gunning you rappers
i don't give a fuck about none of y'all rappers
fifth spray shit , the piff stay lit
my bitch stay dipped with the richard bey tits
niggas say shit , they say it ain't shit
shut the fuck up nigga i'm nothing to play with , p
i bust heaters at your whole damn clique , blaow
sean price , the leader of boot camp clik now
admire the admirable animal rap
smack the shit out of a nigga and hand him his hat
banging on wax , niggas don't bang in the street
banging online , niggas don't bang in the street
playing for keeps , keep playing
i slam your ass on your face til your fucking teeth breaking
p , the jerk that retired , i'm nice so i'm back niggas
smack earth , wind , fire , and ice out that nigga
rap niggas , i doubt if there's
nigga doing it like me , fuck outta here , p
