whole lot of shots followed
after i bust your snot box with a ciroc bottle
shoot the fair one , one mano - a - mano the clown
i'll pull a pound on a ronald mcdonald
you a happy meal nigga , with a toy in the box
i clap the steel , nigga , put your boy in a box
p , and the gun that'll slap ya
i'm lying , just like the rest of these dumb ass rappers
provide flesh , most of y'all niggas can't test besides tek
most of y'all niggas can't dress , nike galore
right on the floor
copped twenty pair with vinnie one time on tour
listen , love is love , clap the gat at y'all haters
the ceo of your label is a basketball player
that mean your shit is never coming out
sean price , i'm forever dumbing out , pyrex
pyrex , a microwave , and a whisk
you're probably thinking i'm baking a cake when i'm working a whip
you probably think it's pyrex
wake up , all of that crack in the street talk
it's made up like " jack and the beanstalk "
when i talk , the streets listen
when you talk , the streets dissin'
i don't even like you
i don't even wanna fight you
so stay the fuck away
for such and such from such and such , come buck and spray
don't make me abuse my power
one telephone call , shoot this coward
i was the bum , but the pendulum switched
now my whole team supreme , no kenneth mcgriff
y'all niggas is fiends , steamed tilapia
ving rhames in the bing , slapping ya , animal
different beast on my fucking sweater , giranimal
half monkey , half man ; the manimal
p , heatmiser in disguise , surprise beat fire
spark fire out your face and break wires
