when i was on , when i was on stage and i was thinking of...
i felt like i know , i know him though
and i know that , and i know his heart
and i know what he wouldn't do to hurt me
but i didn't realize that i - i - i feeling so confident
feeling so great about myself
and then it just be completely shattered
by one thing , by something so stupid
but then you make me feel crazy
you make me feel like it's my fault
i was in pain
what the heart wants
what the heart wants
what the heart wants
you got me sipping on something
i can't compare to nothing i've ever known
i'm hoping that after this fever i'll survive
i know i'm acting a bit crazy
strung out , a little bit hazy
hand over heart , i'm praying
that i'm gonna make it out alive
the bed's getting cold and you're not here
the future that we hold is so unclear
but i'm not alive until you call
and i'll bet the odds against it all
save your advice , 'cause i won't hear
you might be right , but i don't care
there's a million reasons why i should give you up
but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
you got me scattered in pieces
shining like stars and screaming
lighting me up like venus
but then you disappear and make me wait
and every second's like torture
heroin drip , no more so
finding a way to let go
baby , baby , no , i can't escape
the bed's getting cold and you're not here
the future that we hold is so unclear
but i'm not alive until you call
and i'll bet the odds against it all
save your advice , 'cause i won't hear
you might be right , but i don't care
there's a million reasons why i should give you up
but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
this is a modern fairytale
no happy endings , no wind in our sails
but i can't imagine a life without
breathless moments
breaking me down , down , down , down
the bed's getting cold and you're not here
the future that we hold is so unclear
but i'm not alive until you call
and i'll bet the odds against it all
save your advice , 'cause i won't hear
you might be right , but i don't care
there's a million reasons why i should give you up
but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
but the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants
the heart wants what it wants , baby
the heart wants what it wants , baby
it wants what it wants
it wants what it wants
