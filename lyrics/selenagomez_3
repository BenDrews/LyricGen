take away your things and go
you can't take back what you said , i know
i've heard it all before , at least a million times
i'm not one to forget , you know
i don't believe , i don't believe it
you left in peace , left me in pieces
too hard to breathe
i'm on my knees right now
i'm so sick of that same old love , that shit , it tears me up
i’m so sick of that same old love , my body's had enough
oh - oh - oh ( that same old love )
oh - oh - oh ( that same old love )
i’m so sick of that same old love , feels like i've blown apart
i’m so sick of that same old love , the kind that breaks your heart
oh - oh - oh ( that same old love )
oh - oh - oh ( that same old love )
i'm not spending any time , wasting tonight on you
i know , i've heard it all
so don't you try and change your mind
cause i won't be changing too , you know
you can't believe , still can't believe it
you left in peace , left me in pieces
too hard to breathe , i'm on my knees
right now , 'ow
i'm so sick of that same old love , that shit , it tears me up
i’m so sick of that same old love , my body's had enough
oh - oh - oh ( that same old love )
oh - oh - oh ( that same old love )
i’m so sick of that same old love , feels like i've blown apart
i’m so sick of that same old love , the kind that breaks your heart
oh - oh - oh ( that same old love )
oh - oh - oh ( that same old love )
i'm so sick of that , so sick of that love
i'm so sick of that , so sick of that love
i'm so sick of that , so sick of that love
i'm so sick of that , so sick of that love
i'm so sick of that same old love , that shit , it tears me up
i’m so sick of that same old love , my body's had enough
oh - oh - oh ( that same old love )
oh - oh - oh ( that same old love )
i’m so sick of that same old love , feels like i've blown apart
i’m so sick of that same old love , the kind that breaks your heart
oh - oh - oh ( that same old love )
oh - oh - oh ( that same old love )
