the world can be a nasty place
you know it , i know it , yeah
we don’t have to fall from grace
put down the weapons you fight with
kill 'em with kindness
kill 'em with kindness
kill 'em , kill 'em , kill 'em with kindness
kill 'em with kindness
kill 'em with kindness
go ahead , go ahead , go ahead now
we’re running out of time
chasing our lies
everyday a small piece of you dies
always somebody
you’re willing to fight , to be right
your lies are bullets
your mouth's a gun
and no war in anger
was ever won
put out the fire before igniting
next time you’re fighting
kill 'em with kindness
kill 'em with kindness
kill 'em , kill 'em , kill 'em with kindness
kill 'em with kindness
kill 'em with kindness
go ahead , go ahead , go ahead now
go ahead , go ahead now
go ahead , go ahead now
your lies are bullets
your mouth's a gun
no war in anger
was ever won
put out the fire before igniting
next time you’re fighting
kill 'em with kindness
kill 'em with kindness
kill 'em , kill 'em , kill 'em with kindness
kill 'em with kindness
kill 'em with kindness
go ahead , go ahead , go ahead now
go ahead , go ahead now
go ahead , go ahead now
go ahead , go ahead now
