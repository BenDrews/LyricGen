i dive into the future
but i'm blinded by the sun
i'm reborn in every moment
so who knows what i'll become
i feel like i've awakened lately
the chains around me are finally breaking
i've been under self - restoration
i'm becoming my own salvation
showing up , no more hiding , hiding
the light inside me is bursting , shining
it's my , my , my time to butterfly
what i've learned is so vital
more than just survival
this is my revival
this is a revival
oh - oh - oh - oh
oh - oh - oh
oh - oh - oh - oh
revival
oh - oh - oh - oh
oh - oh - oh
oh - oh - oh - oh
revival
i'll walk through the fire , i'll begin again
i'll burn through my skin
cause i , cause i wanna feel it
reaching for the truth , not afraid to lose
what shot out of me like a rifle was a revival , revival
i admit , it's been painful , painful
but i'll be honest , i'm grateful , grateful
it's my , my , my time to realize
what i've learned is so vital
more than just survival
this is my revival
this is a revival
oh - oh - oh - oh
oh - oh - oh
oh - oh - oh - oh
revival
oh - oh - oh - oh
oh - oh - oh
oh - oh - oh - oh
revival
this won't take too long , you'll see
i'm just tryna get to me , ooh
what shot out of me like a rifle was a revival
what i've learned is so vital
more than just survival
this is my revival
this is a revival
oh - oh - oh - oh
oh - oh - oh
oh - oh - oh - oh
revival
oh - oh - oh - oh
oh - oh - oh
oh - oh - oh - oh
revival
what i've learned is so vital
more than just survival
this is my revival
