we fall for each other at the wrong time
only for a moment , but i don't mind
guess i don't know where to draw the line , the line , the line
and we'll play the same game every night
up in the clouds
yeah , you know how to make me want you
when we come down
oh i know , yeah i know , it's over
you don't know how to love me when you're sober
when the bottle's done you pull me closer
and you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
but you don't know how to love me when you're sober
why is it so different when we wake up ?
same lips , same kiss , but not the same touch
don't you know that you do it just enough , but not enough
but i know what's next , and i want so much
up in the clouds
yeah , you know how to make me want you
when we come down
oh i know , yeah i know , it's over
you don't know how to love me when you're sober
when the bottle's done you pull me closer
and you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
but you don't know how to love me when you're sober
i know i should leave , i know i should , should , should
but your love's too good , your love's too good , good , good
i know i should leave , i know i should , should , should
but your love's too good , your love's too good , good , good
yeah !
you don't know how to love me when you're sober
when the bottle's done you pull me closer
and you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
but you don't know how to love me when you're sober
you've got a hold on me
you're like a wasted dream
i gave you everything
but you don't know how to love me when you're sober
