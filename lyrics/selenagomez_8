different inflection when you say my name
kiss me , but your kiss don't taste the same
is it real or am i going out of my mind ?
curious 'bout the company that you keep
cause i hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
and now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine
ooh , and i bet she has it all
bet she's beautiful like you , like you
and i bet she's got that touch
makes you fall in love , like you , like you
i can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
i can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
maybe i should be more like her
maybe i should be more like her
i can taste her lipstick , it's like i'm kissing her , too
and she's perfect
and she's perfect
how does she touch you ? can i try it , too ?
i know you're twisted , but baby , i'm twisted , too
i wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind
with the smell of her perfume
i could love her , too , like you , like you
and i can almost hear her laugh
curving on her back for you , for you
i can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
i can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
maybe i should be more like her
maybe i should be more like her
i can taste her lipstick , it's like i'm kissing her , too
and she's perfect
i can see her body rushing into you
crashing on your skin
burning within , burning so deep , deep
on your skin , skin next to me
she's crashing on your skin
settling in , burning so deep , deep
on your skin , skin while you sleep , uh
i can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
i can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
maybe i should be more like her
maybe i should be more like her
i can taste her lipstick , it's like i'm kissing her , too
and she's perfect
