oh - oo - oh , you think you're something else
okay , so you're a rocket scientist
that don't impress me much
so you got the brains , but have you got the touch ?

but that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
that don't impress me much
i never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
and a comb up his sleeve—just in case
and all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it
