when i first saw you , i saw love
and the first time you touched me , i felt love
and after all this time
you're still the one i love
looks like we made it
look how far we've come my baby
we mighta took the long way
we knew we'd get there someday
they said , " i bet they'll never make it "
but just look at us holding on
we're still together still going strong
( you're still the one )
you're still the one i run to
the one that i belong to
you're still the one i want for life
( you're still the one )
you're still the one that i love
the only one i dream of
you're still the one i kiss good night
ain't nothing better
we beat the odds together
i'm glad we didn't listen
look at what we would be missing
they said , " i bet they'll never make it "
but just look at us holding on
we're still together still going strong
( you're still the one )
you're still the one i run to
the one that i belong to
you're still the one i want for life
( you're still the one )
you're still the one that i love
the only one i dream of
you're still the one i kiss good night
you're still the one
( you're still the one )
you're still the one i run to
the one that i belong to
you're still the one i want for life
( you're still the one )
you're still the one that i love
the only one i dream of
you're still the one i kiss good night
i'm so glad we made it
look how far we've come my baby
