this could be it , i think i'm in love
it's love this time
it just seems to fit , i think i'm in love
this love is mine
i can see you with me when i'm older
all my lonely nights are finally over
you took the weight of the world off my
shoulders ( the world just goes away )
oh , when you kiss me
( when you kiss me )
i know you miss me
( i know you miss me )
and when you're with me
the world just goes away
the way you hold me
( when you kiss me )
the way you show me
( i know you miss me )
that you adore me
oh , when you kiss me
oh , yeah
you are the one , i think i'm in love
life has begun
i can see the two of us together
i know i'm gonna be with you forever
love couldn't be any better
( the world just goes away )
oh , when you kiss me
( when you kiss me )
i know you miss me
( i know you miss me )
and when you're with me
the world just goes away
the way you hold me
( when you kiss me )
the way you show me
( i know you miss me )
that you adore me
oh , when you kiss me
oh , yeah
i can see you with me when i'm older
all my lonely nights are finally over
you took the weight of the world off my
shoulders ( the world just goes away )
when you kiss me
( when you kiss me )

and when you're with me
the world just goes away
