we live in a greedy little world
that teaches every little boy and girl
to earn as much as they can possibly
then turn around and
spend it foolishly
we've created us a credit card mess
we spend the money that we don't possess
our religion is to go and blow it all
so it's shopping every sunday at the mall
all we ever want is more
a lot more than we had before
so take me to the nearest store
can you hear it ring
it makes you wanna sing
it's such a beautiful thing
ka - ching !
lots of diamond rings
the happiness it brings
you'll live like a king
with lots of money and things
when you're broke , go and get a loan
take out another mortgage on your home
consolidate so you can afford
to go and spend some more when you get bored
all we ever want is more
a lot more than we had before
so take me to the nearest store
can you hear it ring
it makes you wanna sing
it's such a beautiful thing
ka - ching !
lots of diamond rings
the happiness it brings
you'll live like a king
with lots of money and things
let's swing
dig deeper in your pocket
oh , yeah , ha
come on , i know you've got it
dig deeper in your wallet
oh
all we ever want is more
a lot more than we had before
so take me to the nearest store
can you hear it ring
it makes you wanna sing
it's such a beautiful thing
ka - ching !
lots of diamond rings
the happiness it brings
you'll live like a king
with lots of money and things
can you hear it ring
it makes you wanna sing
it's such a beautiful thing
ka - ching !
lots of diamond rings
the happiness it brings
you'll live like a king
with lots of money and things
ka - ching...
