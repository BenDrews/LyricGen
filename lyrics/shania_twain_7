complete lyrics available upon release. stay tuned !
i wasn’t just broken , i was shattered
i trusted you so much , you’re all that mattered
you no longer broke me , and i seemed like a suck
life's about joy
life's about pain
it's all about forgiving , and the will to walk away
i'm ready to be loved
and love the way i should
life's about
life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
killed me that you gave your life to be with her
i hope to believe that things would get better
it's hard to forget you , forever
life's about joy
life's about pain
it's all about forgiving , and the will to walk away
i'm ready to be loved
and love the way i should
life's about
life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
it took me so long to be strong
i'm alive , and i hold on
what i can feel it hurts you
oh , i
about to get good
about to get good
about to get good
life's about joy
life's about pain
it's all about forgiving , and the will to walk away
i'm ready to be loved
and love the way i should
life's about
life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
oh , life's about to get good
life's about joy
life's about pain
life's about , life's about to get good
