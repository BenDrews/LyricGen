this is what a woman wants...
any man of mine better be proud of me
even when i'm ugly , he still better love me
and i can be late for a dateâ€”that's fine
but he'd better be on time
any man of mine'll say it fits just right
when last year's dress is just a little too tight
and anything i do or say better be okay
when i have a bad hair day
and if i change my mind
a million times
i wanna hear him say
" yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , i like it that way ! "
any man of mine better walk the line
better show me a teasin' , squeezin' , pleasin' , kinda time
i need a man who knows how the story goes
he's gotta be a heartbeatin' , fine treatin'
breathtakin' , earthquakin' kind
any man of mine
well , any man of mine better disagree
when i say another woman's looking better than me
and when i cook him dinner and i burn it black
he'd better say , " mmmm , i like it like that , yeah "
let me hear you say
" yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , i like it that way ! "
you gotta shimmy shake
make the earth quake
kick , turn , stomp , stomp , then you jump
heel to toe , do si do
'til your boots wanna break
'til your feet and your back ache
keep it movin' 'til you just can't take anymore
come on everybody on the floor
a - one two , a - three four
hup two , hup
if you wanna be a man of mine , that's right
