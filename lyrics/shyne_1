see me flip a couple things , load up magazines
and i - i think you might be the right one , whoa ( the right one )
wait press the brakes , gotta investigate
what i do know - to you it don't matter
whether my pockets is slim or fatter
whether it's bbq's or mr. chow's platter
even if i slip off the success ladder
even if the paragraphs , didn't hit the charts and smash
if my car was a train on the surface or back
i think you'd be right there ( know you'll be right there )
cause we right there , no cartier charms
just you in my arms , no chandon
just a bottle of avian ; c'mon , uh
