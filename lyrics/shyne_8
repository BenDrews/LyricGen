i’m kinda blessed that night in that club
nobody died from that slug
i think about the way that i was
i tell ya i was on one , cuz
bout to catch a few bodies , woulda probably caught the chair
first album ya’ll woulda never got to hear
i can’t believe that i’m here , i should’ve been buried with my pad
close your eyes and turn off the lights
suffering all my life

i guess everything happens for a rhyme and reason
still don’t excuse the lying and treason
you could face 100 years in the precinct
keep your mouth closed , ain’t no speaking
when you in the streets , this is how it goes
police ask you say ‘you don’t know’
make sure the witness all follow same code
death before dishonor ’til they take away your soul
i need to know , how my co - d called witness to sacrifice me
just so he can get away free , this does not comply with the streets
but he ain’t from there , this is not a smear
this is what they fear , the whole truth , i swear

man , only wrongs god can right
look , one thing about me , i was never naive
i might’ve played dumb to get what i need
but i could see , who was he , nothing ain’t surprise me about this creep
ha , i'm from the land of the east , all up in the streets
man mi nuh skin teeth , eyes wide shu , t shotta don’t sleep
look , i seen the plot. what he did to mase , and he did to lox
what he did to wolf and he did to ...
god bless the dead , notorious , 'pac
why would i think that i was different , so i just sat in the distance
kept my mouth closed , looked and listened
learned all the trades of the sharks and fishes
turn off the lights
suffering all my life
wrongs only god can right
i got partners go to jail for bodying ?
get shot , know who shot him ? i won’t testify in court
this kid got millions , that’s how he talks
should’ve took that paper , made his soul walk
talking about he ain’t responsible for my actions
man , if i was yapping the world , woulda knew what happened
them kids was about to wrap him
shyne , they should thank him. but no , they hate him
i hope i ain’t rambling , ya’ll got questions i’m just answering

man , wrongs only god can right
alpo did it to rich , brutus did it to caesar
throughout history , the thing is repeated
in a world where sammy the bull is leaders
frank lucas‘ and joseph massino’s
no , that ain’t my world
all i got is my , and my word
until the electric chair burns , i don’t bend i don’t turn
you ain’t to blame for the witness you called
to say it was me , naaah that ain’t your fault
the lawyers you paid , i mean that you bought
to sacrifice me in open court , ha
i moved on , i promise no more songs
blood , i wish you well , haha , now watch me sell
