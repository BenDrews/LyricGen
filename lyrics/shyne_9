the nine i let it blow
put 5 up in ya clothes
head shots leave you slumped , dumped and reclinin' at ya door
oh'
this is blasphemy
ya whole entire career patterned after me
i got shooters out in cali that will blast for me
your forgot , i put your chest where your back should be
tech squeeze off rapidly
i'm in paris at the plaza , blood , ask for me
you little ungrateful bastard forgot to say your grace after me
now bow down pay homage and ask to breathe

i will put you with the blowfish
hand on my toasters
lamborghini roasters
i gave these rappers life but i will turn them into ghosts
maloy apostle gospel new god flow
i blew breath into your nostrils
only god knows i'm the idol that you bow to
realest alive , your red flag is a costume
this mobsters jewish
the talk is useless

i bomb with rugers
dump you in the pond with sewage
i put that on big wolf : i ain't suin'
hold up

you the big bad blood , what you scared for ?
shoot the butterfly off your face
tell jesus peace and i will smile at your wake
