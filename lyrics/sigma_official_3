hello motherfucka , hey hi how you doing
its weezy f. baby come to take a shit and urine
on the toilet bowl bitches

stomping on this beat like a motherfucking sigma
bad to the bristle , half to the rizzle
i’m so official all i need is a whistle
bitch name crystal
let her suck my pistol
she open up her mouth and then i blow her brains out
you ain’t met a nigga like me
you probably never will
ryders rolling with me like eleven wheels
find out where you living
kill you in the kitchen
the feds trying to clip us
but we ain’t even tripping
i’m goin in , i’m goin in , i’m goin in , i’m goin in
and i'mma go hard , and i'mma go hard , and i'mma go hard , and i'mma go hard
bitch i’m goin in , i’m goin in , i’m goin in , i’m goin in
and i'mma go hard , and i'mma go hard , and i'mma go hard , and i'mma go hard
fuck fucking these bitches
i put on a rubber when i fucking mean business
punch a king vision
i see straight through them
fuck how i did them
watch how i'm about to do them
i'mma drag him from the river
dump his body in the lake
let the bullets from the k throw a party in your face
yeah , dj extra clip , so go dj !
i will kill you on your b - day
have a bitch with twin glocks
jump out your cake
tell her merk em , and don’t forget about the safe'
we ain’t even walking , we runnin this shit
like a toilet in a bank i want my money and shit
and i call cocaine my columbian bitch
and my columbian bitch like my columbian ditch

my style , my style , is second to none
so you got to put me on
like bonita applebum
a tribe called quest
a guy called the best
never lie for less
cause i stand for more
young me
i get it in , yes
i get to the inns like i - n - n
and y'all suite like hotels
and you may be fly but i propel
high profile , gun no smile
warn your child , warn your spouse
and i would keep going in but the song's going out
peace
