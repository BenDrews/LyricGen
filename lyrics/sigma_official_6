i say , ambition killed my innocence
why you think it's rhymes that i'm scribbling
same reason , you're here at the venue , pivoting
green room to green room
nah baby we ain't different
do you wanna roll like the back of the neck on timbaland ?
my siblings known to get it in
see your friends giggling
what you sniffling
ain't insulin , do your thing girl
go erase your pain girl
tell me how it taste girl
top of the morning
i ain't yawning
i blow smoke at the top of the awning
please be honest , i can see you feel so tarnished
yeah , i made some coffee , throw some bacon on the foreman
both of her friends adore me
that always comes with touring
bet you came a long way from getting touched the wrong way
taking care of your little brothers
no boo , ?
we're all tryna make it
try and see what we can parlay
on the way we party
never get played like arcades
don't forget your coat , girl
you know it's such a cold world
( x2 )
and i know all the things you've been through
cause i've probably been through 'em too
don't forget your coat on the way out
tomorrow you can start brand new
another day , another state of mind
we tryna escape , make some cake
fuck a wait in line
you walk past in your heels and your fat ass
you know strength in numbers , didn't learn that shit in math class
you bringing sisters from sigma kappa you chasing after your favorite rapper in hopes of limelights and greener pastures
your burtbag filled with lip gloss and morning after
i know that look you giving me baby , i know i'm dapper
we find comfort in each other , find comfort under covers
both raised by single mothers , both swear the world don't love us
you damn right , they can't touch us , shake your daddy issues
and shake your fatty tissues , let's make this thing official
know to let it go it might sound ludicrous
they say i'm next to blow that makes two of us
i know it seems slow the only way to move is up
who cares though baby struggle ain't new to us
who knew we both got a couple screws loose
we need more than jesus , we need more greygoose
i'm not tryna use you , i'm tryna save you
i'm just tryna do you got my cards up on the table
i'm assuming you mother part of the union
your father skipped town before you even received communion
then we check your i.d. we don't want nobody suing
if this is true please continue what your doing letting loose
you got problems , you undress them
i got problems i address them
on the record baby i know that you better than this
just a victim to the pressure with your fix up on the dresser
you become a predecessor please don't revel in this
least i tried , ain't no turning back it's a
frame of mind , ain't no learning that
there's stars in your eyes , yeah i know you heard of that
so move your thighs to the side baby let me work your back , yeah
