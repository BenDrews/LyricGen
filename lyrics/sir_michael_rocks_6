wassup ? what's crackin ? what's happenin ? what's good ?
you see me ? i'm stacking. i wish a nigga would..
if i don't do nothing else then i'mma make sure all my niggas straight
mills on top of meals is dollar bills on top of dinner plates
iceberg historian , a polo sport extraordinaire
my bitches , man i spoil em , a thousand dollars for her hair
she got that wet and wavy , i fuck her all crazy
eye never lazy , tracy mcgrady
this that lambo truck , camo shorts , cory got the bangers
so hang up if you think you finna call me out my name bruh
" hello ? " don't dial the wrong number , my nigga k be under
we h - 1 hummer , we tape the k up under
you see that ? so disrespect and get a check from the 11th letter
presidential rollie , ferregamo sweater
if that's your girl , you better get her
never let her out of your sight
she looking curious , the king luxurious
she wonder what the jewelry is , her nigga furious
a quarter mil just to insure this shit
right , i like em feisty with a little class
some little titties with a stupid ass
i help her with her rent , i know she's still in school
she got that stupid brain , but baby ain't a fool
i'm scooping up the cash , making my rounds
for different amounts deposit in a checking account
i'm not really interested in trying to make new friends
acquaintances.. i'm busy tryna chase these ends
but when it's time to kick it , i kick it , the toothpick clique
it's me and my niggas , tall tris , kory bellz , l. player
dave c , mike dougie , crack and 'em , boldy james
pac div , gy , meet me at the beehive
uh huh , i tell a bitch to choose up
‘fore we up and lose touch , i ain’t got all night
sippin’ on some sweet syrup but it’s not all sprite
pickin’ up plenty checks but they not all nike’s
