do the drugs , don't let the drugs do you
i pull a porsche turbo through the wormhole
get the bitch to snort the disco inferno
and then she please me wit a organ made for verbal
i lit the herbal , top of the coupe look like the back of a turtle
i smoked a rat pack of backwoods , that good , i'm high as hell
chef the shit , supreme clientele
around the well look how my title felt
i parked the whip up on orion's belt
invest in self to get the weatlh
niggas rapping asking for a shelf
jump in your casket i will actually help
this shit i'm crafting actually health
bitch
roll wit this pimpin' , you ain't seen this in a minute
roll that splidiff , bitch i need that in a minute
right with the digits bitch i got that in a minute
i said i need that in a minute , bitch

roll wit this pimpin' , you ain't seen this in a minute
go get them digits bitch i need that in a minute
roll up that splidiff , bitch i need that in a minute

soulo ho , alpha and omega
rolling wit the blues , i play sonic on sega
knuckled up and put a couple niggas on their tails
interesting i got em' turning heads from telling tales
ab - soul don't forget the dash
my nigga da$h , michael rocks , that's cooked crack
toast to the most dope family
jimmy think that i should slow down wit em' rapidly
climbing to the highest title i'm the future ain't no limits
ya i'm on that miley cyrus , ain't nobody business
wait a minute , am i saying too much
i gotta slip this , did this , display it too much
i'm the illest nigga you seen in a minute
shine my light and illuminate in a minute
bring the house down everytime i'm in it
time is money bitch i only got a minute
got a minute , bitch
bitch i only got a minute
time is money bitch i only got a minute
i'm the illest nigga you seen in a minute
shine my light and illuminate in a minute
smoking the weed in indian scrolls
eating tilapia out of their skulls
blood start dripping , dropping up out of my nose
it got on my clothes
demons be handing me shit , where should i tell them to go
i got the candles lit , pencil in hand
fucking a random bitch , triple the 6 , you understand this shit
starting to question the room
i'm obsessed wit the xans , obsessed wit the moon
possessive wit bitches too soon , bitch you get back in the room
cigarettes is feeling foreign to my diaphragm
g wagon seats from the skin of leviathan
and now we down in the abyss getting high again
da$h give me another strip so i can die again
all you need is a minute
my brother coming with the lean in a minute
it'll kill you in between of a minute
heart jumping out my chest any minute
and i'm in it , really in it
win the lotto all you need is a minute
my brother coming with the lean in a minute
it'll kill you in between of a minute
