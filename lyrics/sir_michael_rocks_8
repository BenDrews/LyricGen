hey mr. fred , we almost dead
make this bread or make your bed
take this ride or take this wheel
take your time or take this pill
i’m hoppin’ out the casket , cocaine on my glasses
some all white buffies that i picked up on my last trip
them niggas is yaggin’ , too much into fashion
my body guard a beast , and if you reach then he spazzin’
that rat - tat - tat action , them lights , camera
i’m like the dodge dealership , i got a lot of challengers
damn this shit remind me of my dogs
i was on a paper mission , get it all
marriani to the drawers , what’s up ?
i went to school but never went to school ‘cause i was busy on tour
‘cause where we live a nigga only as good as his credit card score
a - 1 , i shipped a box of them new iphones straight to my home
two to my dome , can’t feel my eyes
can’t feel my bones , you not alone
when i seen it , i want it , i need it
unlimited visas , my heart in the freezer
i’m on it , you niggas is lacking
napping , you loafing , you lacking the focus
my spanish bitch that i’m with
i’m smashing , i’m stroking , with passion , devotion
that money come , and that money stay
if you fuck her good , she won’t run away
i’m golded up like gabby douglas
my necklace , chasing the sun away
my old niggas still caddy truckin’
i’mma wait for that aston truck
my boonie hittas is savage , bruh
get jammed out in that traffic , cuz
i’m cashin’ out and i’m stackin’ up
your girl pussy is trash as fuck
i never talk shit about a teammate
we goin’ bobby for a pocket full of green face
when i die i’ll be reborn with a clean slate
and rip to the weed that we cremate
