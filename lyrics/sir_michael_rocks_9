on a long ass roll like an eight foot bike
mike rollin' up a plane trynna make that flight
the skinny nigga of the year celebrate that twice
give me the whole damn cake , i don't want no slice
i got these hoes stickin' to me like white on rice
had a blind bitch say she seen me last night
the tris man on point like two red dice
say i can't hit 10 , told em bet they life
i break em off , take it all must be my night
heavy heavy nigga there , left that bitch light
said i've been gone all day and she done called like twice
want me to own that pussy , thinkin' i just might
they say why your bitch so bad and that ass so nice ?
cause i sound damn good and my flow too tight
who lie
fuck more than one niggas wife
and fucked up more than one niggas life
this a free ged
gettin' every dollar bro
its a go its a go
everybody wanna know
where the cheese , where the ski
cause you know its gotta snow
yeah ho
bad hoes know where the bands go
i woke up from a dream of me and the team
touchin' cream like a scene from a drug movie
was playin' clean till i seen you need a machine
i swear to watch the money move is like drugs to me
poppin' up in that porsche ho , thick bitch no torso
just cakey , that pastry , that ooshie gooshie , i can't see my hands
just me and my mans
in the strip club throwin' money call it battle of the bands
and i'm throwin' up a prayer i'll be happy when it lands
and a relationship with two , not sure exactly where i stand
i'm in love with the mozzie , but attracted to the lamb
both hands on the wheel while i'm backin' out the jam
you wish you had the drugs we on
a real nigga in the flesh bitch , blood and bones
we goin' in , goin' hard , when we goin' its on
take it down a notch , lower your tone
when your talkin' bout us...
