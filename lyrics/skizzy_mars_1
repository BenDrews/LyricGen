yo
pop the top off and look up to the sky like
what the fuck is my mind like ?
it's corrupted , nothing you wanna fuck with
wilbon shit
pardon the interruption
and i can gaze at all the city lights
and i can still feel as dark as night
cause i was never a nice guy , always a nice try
always threw a middle finger up to the night sky
as if to say , " fuck em all , fuck em all "
i bet you they don't really know me at all
yeah , they say that nice guys finish last
well , thank god i'm a douchebag
half of a man , cause i never win
like a family in the 'burbs , cause i'm settling in
i told this girl i liked her and she didn't feel the same way
so i said , " bitch you were ugly to begin. "
that's the asshole shit that i be on
these celine girls i like to put the dion
i'm a fucking phenom
but they not with it , then they need to get the peace on
and turn her speakers up when the dj plays these songs
i love girls with low self esteem and some daddy problems
look , that patron and them pills will solve em
seeing things , xanax and klonopin
y'all a bunch of water boys , you need to put the starters in
and if i have to see you out i hope that you will take my
order correctly , never scared to death , i'll be a martyr
resurrect me
feel like your best is equal to my enough
elitist , so i put them fingers up
as if to say , " fuck em all , fuck em all "
i bet you they don't really know me at all
they say that nice guys finish last
well , thank god i'm a douchebag
screw ya man , you don't know what you talking about
meryl streep steeze cause my style's just so hard to doubt
yeah , they say nice guys finish last
well , thank god i'm a douchebag
we talked about money , expendable
city night life is pixar incredible
the shit i do at seventeen supercedes
what you gon do by thirty
and the douchebag persona simply just does not concern me
while you screw it up , dude , guess i do that shit on purpose
don't care about the inside
materialism's concerning
but i'm yearning for some substance like a fein up at the rehab
but i also love giving these feminists reasons to be mad
see me flying like a kite on a windy day
i disregard these hoes
i'm thinking strictly vmas
beer pong , year long , bitches listen to these songs
i'm with some white girls , some lucy liu's and some nia long's
stella's and bella's with boobies named isabella
they ask me how i'm doing and i say , " quite frankly , stellar. "
buzzed like i'm going to the army and it's no surprise
they saying , " skizzy , you're an asshole. "
i roll my eyes
fuck em all , fuck em all
i bet you they don't really know me at all
i got one life line i'm trying not to call
i'm living on the edge and i'm trying not to fall
and it's hard
we took a couple bars and we looked into the stars
we buy some fancy cars
yeah , look they say that nice guys finish last
well , thank god i'm a douchebag
fuck em all , fuck em all
i bet you they don't really know me at all
they say that nice guys finish last
well , thank god i'm a douchebag
screw ya man , you don't know what you talking about
meryll streep steeze cause my style's just so hard to doubt
yeah , they say that nice guys finish last
well , thank god i'm a douchebag
thank god i'm a douchebag
thank god i'm a douchebag
yeah , they say that nice guys finish last
well , thank god i'm a douchebag
