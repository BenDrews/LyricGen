i am a man , man man man , up up in the air
and i run around 'round 'round 'round this town town
and act like i don't care
so when you see me flying by the planet's moon
you don't need to explain if everything's changed
just know i'm just like you
baby you got a man , i don't care , that's irrelevant
known for making bad decisions for the hell of it
young skizzles , taste the rainbow
but that's so beside the point it's sitting next to it
got a blonde girl with sass that i think's named hailey
and she knows i'll always handler like chelsea lately
look , bitch ass yeah i’m staring at you
top floor , penthouse with a aerial view
it’s skizz
it's the colors you have
no need to be sad
it really ain't that bad
it's the colors you have
no need to be sad
you still got your hand
all the douche bags , assholes , and beer pong connoisseurs
ceo's , interns , unemployed entrepreneurs
i love 'em all , the hipsters , the fashionistas
stay outside of beef , took a liking to peta
my mom's mona , her mom took a liking to lisa
my dad's a shopaholic he took a liking to visa's
i showed them my tunes , and they like what they seeing
a yearly drug tests , they don't like what i'm peeing
with every song , my fan base i am increasing
penthouse , pedestrians i'm defeating
the aston ? remember i wanted a nissan ?
had to change phones , these hoes call a lot
horse lifestyle , bitch , i call the shots
see me flying like an eagle , save the cape
gay marriage is legal but my vodka's straight
promise i never sell out like ebay
i'm just trying to make my fam proud like deejanay
hey
it's the colors you have
no need to be sad
it really ain't that bad
it's the colors you have
no need to be sad
you still got your hands
all the girls wouldn't look twice when i arrived
now they look thrice when i arrive
now it'll be a howie day when you and i collide
cause i'mma be richer than you is what i prophesize
so , go on to your 9 to 5's
had my stella open when i arrive
true colors show , and i know
ya'll just want me to slow down and catch up to my fast life
so i am a man , man man man , up up in the air
and i float around 'round 'round 'round this town town
and know i shouldn't care
so when you see us there there out in the open road
you don't need to explain if everything's changed
just know that you don't know
we call it...
narcissistic , elitist , she concerned with the music
and i'm enjoying her features
i was singing the killers , they were bumping " ether "
i'm looking through the window man the view was fucking scenic
well my song's on , so let that bitch play
oh that girl's drunk ? well let that bitch stay
oh she's on her knees ? i let that bitch pray
and i just wanna smoke weed and write music everyday
look i still ride the bus dude i'm still broke
and i'm still number 1 bitch i'm still oak
they told me get your swag up and be a star
i'm trying to have all you tired rappers be alarmed
got that poker life style , we all - in for these moments
i ain't even in my prime , composite for the moment
i'm trying to lead and have my name be significant
survival of the fittest and i'm all about conditioning
cause i'm a fucking star
it's the colors you have
no need to be sad
it really ain't that bad
it's the colors you have
no need to be sad
you still got your hands
if you're a real skizzy fan put your hands in the air
put your hands in the air
if you're a real skizzy fan put your hands in the air
in the muhfuckin' air
if you're a real skizzy fan put your hands in the air
put your hands in the air
put your hands in the air
