rolling down these desert hills
rolling up these dollar bills
all the drinks that we've been drinking strong as fuck , girl
i'm not gon' lie , i just wanna fuck , girl
and the waitress is taking too long
let's hit your spot , mine's too far
pop another stick , i'm getting bolder
moncler on , the city's getting colder
you don't need no makeup girl , you're natural
her friend pissing me off , she just asked for blow
bitch i gave you some , why you back for more ?
she a fiend , nineteen , with a past to show
tryna take you to the w after show
and play you all my new shit , we could really do shit

got a french dimepiece , yeah we international
if you want it in l.a , i can do you there
if you want it in the bay , i can do you there
everywhere that you be , girl
everywhere that you stay
role play , reality , we stay acting up
if you want it in ny , i can do you there
if you want it in the chi , i can do you there
everywhere that you be , girl
everywhere that you stay
role play , reality , we stay acting up
you holdin' down that sex appeal

giuseppe's on your feet , no you're not playin'

can't stay long , different city every night
but you show me something good after a long day
got ros√© , we got dom p , no andre
drinking all this absinthe , it's like i'm here but my body's absent
you're the type to have your cake and eat it
you said he had a record , let me beat it
your man's a flop , you need you a replacement
i'm that type to just get back to basics
look at what i'll give you , won't you take it ?
in a penthouse , they in the basement
we throw cigarettes off my terrace for entertainment
she know why she came , yo , there's no explaining
always text her hours later with no explanation
baby , i'm a busy man , i was prolly faded
i got this girl in florida
i smash her friend whenever i get bored of her
and i got this girl out in the bay
i don't know how many bars she takes
and shout out my girl eileen
hooked on drugs in seattle , i wish i was smashing
and word to laura , from atlanta
