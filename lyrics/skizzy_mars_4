wasting all of this time
i don't mind ( mind , yeah no no )
wasting all of this time
i don't ( yeah ) , i said i don't ( said i don't )
( said ) i said i don't mind ( said )
tell me who the most consistent
is when i leave she be so persistent
crib overseas cause my bitch is foreign
please light the weed get to problem solving
never mind school we got lots of knowledge
she got some big dreams but she stuck in college
look me in the eye since you speak
like you got this shit all figured out ( all figured out )
keenan got the audi and we all liquored out
took one dab now she all trippin' out
sportscenter anchor this a whole different route
she mad i live at home , like you ever moving out
bitch , patience is the key
i know i gotta lay up but i'm taking it from three
i'm pacing victory
just wait and see , time is of the essence
wasting never wasted , i'm taking this for me
wasting all of this time
i don't mind ( mind , yeah no no )
wasting all this of time
i don't mind ( mind , yeah no no )
yeah , tell me who the most consistent
is tell her chill , be home in an instant
i took her out for dinner , called the uber ; see it yet ?
look at me and laugh , she say " you ain't copped the beamer yet ? "
selling records now , ain't you supposed to flex more ?
playing in like 16 countries on my next tour
she said " i get it but at least could send a text more
if you got time for the music , what's the rest for ? "
everything in due time , patience is a virtue
thinking about what other people got should never hurt you
if you're too weak your heart gets broken like a curfew
anything worth having always takes some time to pursue
nothing comes fast except a virgin
can never take a shortcut , i'm not that type of person
if you love what you have , well then what's the point of searching ?
i ever hear you cheatin' it's a wrap like a turban
quick visits here and there , hope it helps still
i know she longs for commitment and something else real
i'm never around , she look like she on the shelf still
told me " you don't cop a ring soon , someone else will "
wasting all of this time
i don't mind ( mind , yeah no no )
wasting all this of time
i don't mind ( mind , yeah no no )
tell me who the most consistent
b gotta leave cause i need my distance
still feeling different , missing pops on christmas
still spit the truth and the youth will listen
niggas after cheese , niggas on a mission
make 'em cooler now , i'm the new edition
5'5 " la girl , cute with dimples
it's not complicated , yo , it's super simple
now skizzy be the man wanna see you doing good
i don't wanna get rich , leave you in the hood
girl in my eyes you the dopest
reason why i love you cause you always keep focused
and i'm always stressing but you know i keep hoping
had the door closed now you always keep open
keep smoking , keep motion
it's called progress , take breaks but not yet
don't take it out of context
but
wasting all of this time
i don't mind ( mind , yeah no no )
wasting all this of time
i don't mind ( mind , yeah no no )
wasting all of this time
i don't mind ( i don't )
i don't mind
i don't mind
i don't mind
