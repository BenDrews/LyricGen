they love me now but everything is temporary
baby everything is temporary
i don't know , i guess i'll meet a lot of women
maybe by the time i'm 40 i can make a damn decision
thinkin' back on isabel and whitney
you know how you get to smoking , reminiscin'
man , maybe that was premature
failed you when you needed more
but baby just be assured
i think about you everyday
took you to these new heights , watch your ass levitate
smoked at your crib , i was scared to take you on a date
mom was in the other room
making sure that we ain't do
no rated r shit
i guess you love myles , not that skizzy mars shit
now this indica got me so lethargic
looking for a real girl on some lars shit
my whip all black like a tyler perry cast
these girls all remind me of my last
you just remind me of my past
fuck you , where the jack ?
man , i need another glass
she said she loves me
she don't know what love means
that's what they all say

she don't know what love means
that's what they all say
she said she loves me
she don't know what love means
she said she loves me
she don't know what love means

that reminds me of this time at the hard rock
after a show in the chi that was sold out
this girl told me that she loved me
i said girl you don't know me
i kissed this girl before i went away on tour
her name is - she's special , i'm sure
i don't know , i could just tell we had a future
but she's enrolled at an ivy , and me i be acting stupid
i be
rappin' bout money and drugs ; and drugs and bitches
but i've been searching for something that's different
now she's abroad , i just hope that she doesn't forget me
it's crazy how we never chill , but i fuckin' miss ya
you're so pretty girl
won't you be my city girl
bring chivalry's back like it's the 50's girl
i like your hair , i like your eyes , i like your face
i don't know , i just need a change of pace
she said she loves me
she don't know what love means
that's what they all say
she said she loves me
she don't know what love means
that's what they all say
she said she loves me

couple more shots , more patron waitress
oh , you don't like tequila ?
that's my bad
well , i don't really drink it either
now i'm getting a fever 'cuz i'm nervous
but i'm glad that you came to the bar with me
drunk words are sober thoughts
imma quit cigarettes if it turns you off
but then you had me running through the school
looking like a fool
damn and that's what you want ?
people rarely change , we just stay the same
i've been the same nigga since the 9th grade
steady trynna find the right pace
moving fast 'cuz the speed so enticing
she said she'll never lie to me
you're lying right now
i'm 'bout to hit the jackpot
i'm timing it out
i think the goose got her , we icing it out
it's been a long ass night , we winding it down
she said she loves me
she don't know what love means
that's what they all say
she said she loves me
she don't know what love means
that's what they all say
she said she loves me
she don't know what love means
she said she loves me
she don't know what love means
that's what they all say
