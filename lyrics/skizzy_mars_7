oh lucy , oh lucy , oh
oh lucy , oh lucy , oh , yeah
oh lucy , oh lucy , oh
oh lucy , oh lucy , oh , yeah
blacked out , so i don't remember
its a war , and i won't surrender
getting back on my schedule
got your whole future ahead of you
but your past is making the present wrong
and it sucks cause you never intended too
and i talk about it , that's what we tend to do
i'm about to pass out , ate an edible
do it from ten to two , straight to the club
so you with your man , you say that you are in love with him
i doubt it ( x3 ) , you mad , you pouting
you get loud , you get shouting
use your voice to make points
i don't face facts , i face joints
i'm hurt
she said " hurt people , hurt people " yeah ( x4 )
the whole concept of success to me is a little bit warped
oh lucy , oh lucy , oh , yeah
oh lucy , oh lucy , oh
oh lucy , oh lucy , oh
but you are only twenty , lucy
you don't know what love will do to you
have you acting funny , doing shit that's so unusual
she said " you keep this up , i swear you gonna lose me "
met her on a tuesday , i remember loosely
so i probably gonna drink about it
you just want to use me , put it in a song
i still love her , she's my lucy
damage from the last , so i focus on the first
probably settle with the next , cause it just couldn't be worst
i'm hurt
put the weed in the trunk
if the cops wanna stop us , no reason to front
pick up the phone , girl it has been like a month
got me drinking and driving and smoking a blunt
damage goods , so young , your damage goods
not doing shit , that you should probably do
got this thing that is understood
my shrink says that i got a.d.d
maybe that explains it all
still can even sit straight
took all of these adderall
man this feeling , fuck i hate it
gotcha too work up to call
i just turn twenty - one last month
i haven't grown up at all
