catch me everyday
getting high off this pub deal money
your sitting back , taking in what the worlds got for me
it's so funny
i'm driving fast hoping that i never crash
its only been a year but i thought that this would never last
we smile share a couple laughs , haha
i use to do the shakespeare competitions.
i just hope that they listen when i'm talking
i hope they recognize me when i walk in
and i wanted niggas to hear me , way before they saw me
i don't respond to every tweet , i think that shit is corny
but i'm showing love to everyone that loves and supports me
and all these girls back from high school all of a sudden want to hit me up
i went to school i kinda liked it , but i had to give it up
i can sit in class or i can live it up
two ways and i chose the uncommon the subtle beauty of vending machines
and ramen noodles i had gotten use to
its strange you already know
girl whatchu crying for ?
cheer up , cheer up , cheer up oh
she keep saying that she got to go
but i know that you want to stay
cheer up , cheer up i'm a help yah cheer up oh
cheer up , cheer up i'm a help yah cheer up oh , oh
damn , you got your whole life planned out
basically , i was always a stand out
you the type that always got your hand out
i was the type to doodle on the hand out
fuck homework , i'mma be the man now
it's kinda sad cuz shorty show me love
but without all the drugs , i'm pretty sure she can't smile
top down , riding through my city like i'm hot now
i'm popping like the champagne cap
we at the club popping champagne caps
plus i rap good , man you can't change that , its looking sunny in the future
and that's just my opinion
i'm dropping out of school , and that's just my decision
people ask me why i'm not fucking ecstatic
this is not what i envisioned , so find me a nice crib i can live in
or a pool of women i can swim in
i rather never finish what i start , than never start what i can finish
keep your head down
dude , can you free style ?
do groupies give you head now ?
so you went to school , but you're doing this instead now ?
these debit dudes never give me cred now
