your reflection in my wine glass
that's when i look away
can't stand to think about losing your fine ass
how the fuck i let you slip away ?
life of the party , but i'm dead inside
killed my vibes , it was genocide
hard to act like i've been alive
i'm tryna find where i identify
one time for the girl that got away
two times for the bub i'm about to spray
three times for the power that i pray to
are you up there ? can you hear me ?
i know i fucked up it's clear , see
i'm 22 but i don't act like it , clearly
and all this shit is a mirage
i'm just rapping for a cause
that life , the fame that lights the game
we break the laws , don't like to change
want to win you back , but i hate to lose
i know that you're the one , but it's hard to choose
and all these lies they keep on slippin' out
i said i don't believe that you just passed out on the couch
cause i've been nothing but good to you
( and i ain't done the same girl )
your howlin' into the night won't do
cause i've been nothing but good to you
( and i ain't done the same girl )
your howlin' into the night won't do
look , too much whiskey in my red cup
remember first date you wouldn't give it up
we had only scratched the surface
but i knew that you were worth it
yeah , yeah , so i was patient
i bragged to my niggas joe namath
i'm still with the niggas that i came with
but everything changed once some fame hit
make it up , take you down
have a shot , i bought a round
play my song , you like the sound
it's going down , it's going down
let's drink coffee , watch passerbys
and prove to you i'm not the average guy
it's just my flaws that they magnify
and when it's real , you don't have to try
and all these lies they , keep on slippin' out
i said i don't believe that you just passed out on the couch
cause i've been nothing but good to you
( and i ain't done the same girl )
your howlin' into the night won't do
cause i've been nothing but good to you
( and i ain't done the same girl )
your howlin' into the night won't do
i wish there was another way
tomorrow is another day
drugs take the pain away
sometimes i wanna run away
i wish there was another way
tomorrow is another day
drugs take the pain away
sometimes i wanna run away
i've been nothing but good to you
( and i ain't done the same girl )
your howlin' into the night won't do
cause i've been nothing but good to you
( and i ain't done the same girl )
