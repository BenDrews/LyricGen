i need you the , i need you , i need you the , i need you
i need y - y - y - y - y , i need you the , i need you , i need you the
i need you , i need y - y - y - y - you the m - m - m
i need you the most
i gave you the key when the door wasn't open , just admit it
see , i gave you faith , turned your doubt into hoping , canâ€™t deny it
now i'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
tell me , where are you now that i need you ? where are you now ?
where are you now that i need ya ? couldn't find you anywhere
when you broke down i didn't leave ya , i was by your side
so where are you now that i need ya ?
where are you now that i need ya ?
where are you now that i need ya ?
where are you now that i need ya ?
i gave you attention when nobody else was payin'
i gave you the shirt off my back , what you sayin' ? to keep you warm
i showed you the game everybody else was playin' , that's for sure
and i was on my knees when nobody else was prayin' , oh lord
where are you now that i need ya ?
where are you now that i need ya ?
i need you the i need you , i need you the i need you , i need you , where are you now that i need ya ?
i need you the i need you , i need you , i need you the most
where are you now that i need ya ?
where are you now that i need ya ?
