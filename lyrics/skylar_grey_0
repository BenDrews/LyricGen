you sit there stone - faced , as if i'm not here
can't you see that i've been crying ?
i didn't know you'd be insane
dreams can be so deceiving
you're an itch i can't reach , a wound that won't heal
the smell of skin that's burning
i didn't know you'd be insane
but it's true , and just say all i am to you is a
pain in my neck , thorn in my side
stain on my blade , blood on my knife
been dreaming of her , all of my life
but she won't come true , she's just my nightmare i woke up to
she's twisted , he's a rebel , she's sick , he's hard to handle
but worst of all is she just don't care
she's twisted like a rope that is wrapped around her throat
but still worst of all is she ( he ) really don't give a...
( she ( he ) don't give a shit )
sometimes i wish that you would just die
cause i'm too afraid of leaving
i didn't know you'd be insane
dreams can be so deceiving
( how did it come to this ?
why do i fantasize to kill you when you're sleeping ? )
i didn't know you feel the same
when i say you're no good , all you are to me , is a
pain in my neck , thorn in my side
stain on my blade , blood on my knife
been dreaming of her , all of my life
but she won't come true , she's just my nightmare i woke up to
she's twisted , he's a rebel , she's sick , he's hard to handle
but worst of all is she just don't care
she's twisted like a rope that is wrapped around her throat
but still worst of all is she ( he ) really don't give a...
love ain't no fairytale , love is a buried nail
inside of this heart of stone , so you wanna get married ? well
romeo , romeo , smokin' blow with antonio
in the back alley takin' shots of whiskey and only gold
juliet's at the nudie bar , doin' god only knows
neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
but a bitch is a bitch , and a horse is a horse , ain't it ?
sorry , i can't afford to get your daddy's old porsche painted
sorry , juliet that you embedded the sayin'
if a dollar makes you holler , well then i'm gettin' the short change of it , uh
feel like i've been asleepin' alone and lovin' this angel
entangled between a dream and a coma
walkin' the edge of this cliff , like a sheep to it's owner
then woke up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
then they pack up and leave and then you bitch about how you miss 'em
you gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
'round and 'round we roll , where it stops , baby nobody knows
some people go crazy and they lose control
some people jump off , some people won't let go
some people say love , some people say why
some people don't love , they just want a free ride
the rain won't stop , it'll never dry
if she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside
but
she's twisted , he's a rebel , she's sick , he's hard to handle
but worst of all is she just don't care
she's twisted like a rope that is wrapped around her throat
but still worst of all is she ( he ) really don't give a...
but maybe i'm the twisted one that screwed this up
so i guess this means goodbye , for now , *laughter*
