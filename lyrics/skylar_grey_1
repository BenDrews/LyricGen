oooooh
oooooh
oooooh
you could make me a believer
even if that shit ain't true
you could make me commit murder
baby , i'd kill for you
in my eyes
even if you are wrong , you are right
even if it's a terrible crime , it's alright
cause i got your back , and i know you got mine
i belong to the church of your name , sing a song
'cause i worship the ground you walk on
if i pray for you , i know you'll be there
you could make me a believer
even if that shit ain't true
you could make me commit murder
baby , i'd kill for you
in my bed i believe every word that you've said
just a kiss and you make me forget
all the bad , the battles we lost , the bodies we hid
you don't know , just how far i'd be willing to go
you put the cracks into my moral code
so you can count on me to always be there
you could make me a believer
even if that shit ain't true
you could make me commit murder
baby , i'd kill for you
oh , lord , forgive my weary hands
and for what they may do
i'll carry out his evil plans
if he wants me to
in your dream , you're drownin' , i just waltz in and saved you
i'm your alternate escape route , the altar you pray to
your ultimate savior , your behavior is altered
ain't your fault 'cause i made you
brainwash and persuade you
gibraltar , your faith'll never falter or waver
one you call to in danger , i'm your guardian angel
nobody can tell you shit , you've already made your
mind just follow me , babe , you
won't be sorry you stayed , you
always ride , whatever the plan is
'til the end , even if i led us into an ambush
even if we robbed a first national and cops caught us redhanded
they're coming at us , and we're trapped with our backs up
against the wall , and it's too tall
you'd catapult me or hold the ladder for me
stay back to get captured , take the fall
you make it all worth it
baby doll , you're perfect the way you are
accidents happen
all i know is you love me , that's really all that matters
and any who cross our paths are just collateral damage
at your side , got your lateral , back , your front , diagonal
backwards , blackbirds , we attack like animals
when they threaten what we have it's a natural reaction
you'll lay a bitch flat on her back in a second flat for me
who tries to take your man from you
it's blasphemy , another casualty , you'll go whatever route
do whatever you have to do , you'd blast for me
i never doubt that
that's 'cause you
you could make me a believer
even if that shit ain't true
you could make me commit murder
baby , i'd kill for you
*gun shot*
