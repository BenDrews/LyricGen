good morning gorgeous
i drove your truck in the lake last night
hope she was worth it
don’t worry i slept just fine
you keep throwin punches but you won’t win this fight
you’re just fuckin yourself when you don’t read the signs
i’m going to the kitchen comin back with a knife
cuz i’ve had enough this time
this is your final warning
there’s a dark cloud overhead
this is your final warning
just remember what i said
yeah , someone’s gonna get hurt
na na na na na na na na na
yeah , someone’s gonna get hurt
na na na na na na na na na
and its not gonna be me
good afternoon dear
how does the rope feel around your neck ?
just one more error
could be a fatal step
you keep throwin punches but you won’t win this fight
you’re just fuckin yourself when you don’t read the signs
i’m going to the kitchen comin back with a knife
cuz i’ve had enough this time
cuz you’re the one thing
you are , you are the one thing
