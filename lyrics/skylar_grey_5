i never thought that you and i would ever meet again
i mourn the loss of you sometimes and pray for peace within
the word " distraught " cannot describe how my heart has been
but where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead ?
where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead ?
where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead ?
i held the funeral the day you left
a black umbrella and a sad song in my head
buried your pictures that i loved the most
‘cause if you survived me i just didn’t wanna know
so you can’t just come back now like a demon uninvited
no you can’t just expect me to open my door to you because
i never thought that you and i would ever meet again
i mourn the loss of you sometimes and pray for peace within
the word " distraught " cannot describe how my heart has been
but where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead ?
where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead ?
where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead ?
i’m so confused i don’t know what to feel
should i throw my arms around you or kill you for real ?
‘cause i worked so hard to put the past to rest
now it’s tumbling down on me just like an avalanche
so you can’t just come back now like a demon uninvited
no you can’t just expect me to open my door to you because
i know i know i can sit and talk but i can’t make you listen
you wish that i paid attention , i thought if i paid admissions
to wherever , go however , it would paint the perfect picture
you said " no matter how much you fucking make it doesn’t make a difference "
and i’m so so so sorry that we fell in love , geronimo
it’s like one thing leads to another
swear we’re fucking with dominos
but , here we are
now i’m trying to find an answer in this bottle girl
and i’m drownin' slow , drownin slow , don’t let the piranhas know
but you gon’ miss me when i’m gone
why we gotta wait that long ?
baby do - do - do - do - don’t
or should i walk out instead
is this live and let die or night of the living dead ?
i never thought that you and i would ever meet again
i mourn the loss of you sometimes and pray for peace within
the word " distraught " cannot describe how my heart has been
but where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead ?
where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead ?
where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead ?
