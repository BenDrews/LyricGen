always in a rush
never stay on the phone long enough
why am i so self - important ?
said i'd see you soon
but that was , oh , maybe a year ago
didn't know time was of the essence
so many questions
but i'm talking to myself
i know that you can't hear me any more
not anymore
so much to tell you
and most of all goodbye
but i know that you can't hear me any more
it's so loud inside my head
with words that i should have said
and as i drown in my regrets
i can't take back the words i never said
i never said
i can't take back the words i never said
always talking shit
took your advice and did the opposite
just being young and stupid
i haven't been all that you could've hoped for
but if you'd held on a little longer
you'd have had more reasons to be proud
so many questions
but i'm talking to myself
i know that you can't hear me any more
not anymore
so much to tell you
and most of all goodbye
but i know that you can't hear me any more
it's so loud inside my head
with words that i should have said
and as i drown in my regrets
i can't take back the words
the longer i stand here
the louder the silence
i know that you're gone but sometimes i swear that i hear
your voice when the wind blows
so i talk to the shadows
hoping you might be listening 'cos i want you to know
it's so loud inside my head
with words that i should have said
and as i drown in my regrets
i can't take back the words i never said
i never said
i can't take back the words i never said
never said
i can't take back the words i never said
i can't take back the words i never said
i can't take back the words i never said
