i believe , i believe there's love in you
gridlocked on the dusty avenues
inside your heart , just afraid to go
i am more , i am more than innocent
but just take a chance and let me in
and i'll show you ways that you don't know
don't complicate it
don't let the past dictate
yeaaah
i have been patience , but slowly i'm losing faith
so please , i know you baby
i know you baby
so please , i know you baby
i know you baby
i believe , i believe you could love me
but you're lost on the road to misery
and what i gave to you
i could never get back !
don't complicate it
don't drive yourself insane
yeaaah
say what you will but i know that you want to stay !
i know you baby
so please , i know you baby
chemicals rushing in
i know it's you that i belong to
i'm burning like a cannonball in the air
crashing into who i belong to
ooooh oh , ooooh oooohh
i have been patience , but slowly i'm losing faith
please , i know you baby
i know you baby
so please , i know you baby
i know you baby
please , i know you baby
i know you baby
so please , i know you baby
i know you baby
( the shadows of your heart
are hanging in the sweet , sweet air )
i know you baby
( the secrets that you hide , control us and it's just not fair )
i know you baby
( the shadows of your heart
