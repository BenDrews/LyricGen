when you close your eyes
you can see the day rewind
all the laughs and stupid fights
you and i we roll like thunder in the sky
just like a party breaks at dawn
it never stops for long
i will return don't you ever hang your head
i will return in every song and each sunset
our memory is always within reach
i will return , i will return
don't you ever hang your head
when you're feeling empty
i will be the fuel you need
to keep on pushing on down the lonely street
and i'm always in the shotgun seat
home like headlights on the lawn , i'm never gone for long
i will return don't you ever hang your head
i will return in every song and each sunset
our memory is always within reach
i will return , i will return
don't you ever hang your head
i will return don't you ever hang your head
i will return don't you ever hang your head
i will return in every song that is unsaid
our memory is always within reach
i will return , i will return don't you ever hang your head
