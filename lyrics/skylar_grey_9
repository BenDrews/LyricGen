well they can try to sink us , but i'll just swim
because my will is stronger than a gale force wind
look out , look out , cause each time i fall
i'll be crashing down , right through your walls
here i come
cannonball , cannonball
here i come
cannonball , cannonball , cannonball
and when they light their torches , when they scream and yell
i'm gonna raise my flag and gonna give 'em hell
look out , look out , cause each time i fall
i'll be crashing down , right through your walls
here i come
cannonball , cannonball
here i come
cannonball , cannonball , cannonball
at the end of the day
when the air is still and the sky is grey
let's swim
who will be standing ?
i challenge you all
bombs away , bombs away
here i come
cannonball , cannonball
here i come
cannonball , cannonball
here i come
cannonball , cannonball
here i come
cannonball , cannonball , cannonball
