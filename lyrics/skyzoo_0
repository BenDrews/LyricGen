holla like whatever all we needed was a reason
all this money they been showing they got reasons through the ceiling
all we wanted was a part , all this seeing is believing
from the jump its from the heart , pardon we wit all this breathing
all this anticipation , all this keeping this shit even
all these hands in the way when all they reaching is beneath 'em
all these plans we done made , all we see is what we keeping
all you standing in the way is only leading us to be it
bet whatever on the vision , if they get it then they on it
if they don't but they close enough to see us and adore it
let em watch from over there , let em watch and know we here
better dreams while we up , better watches for your stares
call it range rover rhythm , and may we go and get 'em
at the will of what we on , and may we blow the engines
may it be just what we want , and may it all glitter
just the same as what we saw cause what we saw was fucking splendid
all the scenery they threw us , easy to influence
nothing bout us changed , so you can leave us if you knew us
jumping out a range had us dreaming to maneuver
and mu'fuckas tryna brand new us
range rover rhythm
corner store signature
i don't do it for me
i do it for the liquor store
said we knew what it be
knew it what's about
tryna 80 thou' somethin' 'fore we out
( and all we kno is ) how the sweetest dream couldn't be anymore heinous
promise if you sleeping you'll see where we all aiming
cause dreaming is all tainted , but we was on that anyway
should've never offered us to get a taste
good to enough to want it on a bigger plate
climbing thru a kitchen tryna get a plate
either find a way or go and drill away
living like , 400 a pair , yea my penny's straight
living like the ending was beginning with a get a way
another day , another dollar , we just tryna get a day
and pull a whole decade within a day
promise you my penny straight
straight enough to '95 hardaway penetrate
and open up a lane if they don't give a lane
lanes open bigger for that range rover rhythm
tryna open up the hood and put a name on that engine
if it go misunderstood , i'll remain on my pivot
for a steering wheel draped in a vision
hospital days , reflecting when my man laid up
on a uptown hot block he got his side sprayed up
i saw his life slippin' , on the day in question i told him
i would've went wit him , thank god he ain't listen
reminiscing over henny and all of them pictures
we ride around now knowing we're probably different
and how it sounds now , know me as part of the feeling
i gave it life , muthafuck a honorable mention
