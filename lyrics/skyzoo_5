fitted like you're in front of a step and repeat
i'm listening to everyone tryna get you to leave
when they finished i'm over here , letting you breathe
and my fitted is all grey if you check underneath
meaning i'm on that side , opposites attract right ?
and i'm attracted to getting rid of your past like
everything you need , you believe and you react like
no one ever did this , they had you underprivileged
cause you was in your mirror for a reason though
6 for them murder heel's , i'm guessing you keeping those
keeping those means you'll be breaking them in around the stuy
the truth will prolly get you a win , i'm not surprised
they making you wanna leave , i got you thinking to stay
i'm here to get in your talk , they here to get in your way
i'm here to be what they wasn't , here to be why you love it
hearing me got you buzzing but scared to give me a play
i knew it , you feel like you know - me
so you don't wanna leave here & feel like you owe - me
i already knew it , you feel like you know - me
you holding back just as much as you wanna show - me
see the thing about it is
i don't know what it is
but i wanna find out
why am i feeling like
i know you , i know you
i know you , yeah , i swear
your friends tell you let it go
like " yea he fly but he'll never do the x & o's "
maybe they're right , or maybe they have yet to know
maybe tomorrow when we wake up you can tell em though
pardon me , but , i be knowing baby , i be knowing
and you looking like you ain't looking for nothing they be throwing , right ?
i agree , so when you tryna leave
say the word and i'll follow words and follow leads
however it gotta be as long as you get to live a little
henny straight , i promise you it'll benefit you
feeling like you wanna see if it can get you there
balmain mini dress , let it disappear
in your ear with the opposite of the man before me
i got no game its just some women understand my story
i'm wit it if you wit it
and drive back prepping you for all that you been missing
i swear that i know you
what you saying i already know
as much as i know you
i still wanna hear mo'
i swear that i know you
but i'm still all yours
i swear that i know you
i know you , i know you , yeah
i swear
