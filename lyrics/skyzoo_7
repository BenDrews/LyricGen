figured i'll rap a lil bit
figured i'mma rap a lil bit
but i don't really know how i'mma set it off , lemme see
i guess how i set it off will determine how to finish em
finishin this is fine , the finish line is the scrimmage
scrimmagin the design , designin is by the witness
witnessin from the side , as im driftin by the endin
endin another stanza by beginning to explain it
explainin an explanation and waitin while you arrange it
arrangin it around and i'm astound from where you place it
complacement was out of place , just try to keep it adjacent
to the couplet , tercet , quatrain , cinquain , sextet , septet , octave and implain
labeled at the two to eight , eight'll get you through the day
double that and you could cut up that and cut the move away
away from where they wave at , i looked down , waved back
waving gets impatient , you picking wrong ( ? ) i waved that
that would be the obvious , obviously i should just
stick with this and see what the oblivious is tryin to catch
catch it if you up for it , the catchin is the jump for it
the catch is if you catch it you catchin whatever come with it
wit it for the wittiest , winnin off of winninness ( ? )
lose the whereabouts of the wit like i through the wind in it
in it for the incline , included to intwine
inclination of any innovation within mine
mine like i moulded it one rib sculpted it
shook em off of syllables , i ain't have to motive it , huh
throwin out frisbees , show me you can catch it
show me you can catch it , show me you can catch it , catch it ( x3 )
show me that you caught that , show me that you caught that
show me that you caught that , and i could throw some more back
more like you ain't had enough , enough of the aver - rush
the rush of the rage is the rage that was added up
upper echelon , sketch a song , stretch the batter up
call a beat the lactose , pray and keep me padded up
over all of the under regardless of what come after it
keep the second half of it if under is attached to it
attachin me to the back of leaders is all blasphemous
front runner , one number , one of one maximum
maxin out , more is now , rightfully the talk is out
hype for me excitedly , swipin like if door arounds
swipa , no - swipa , no bitin , no knawin now
now or never , i'm around whatever if the call is out
out of what's considered to be considered considerable
i couldn't find a reason to leave up outta the lyrical
fuck all of the fuckery , motherfuckers luckily ain't see me with a cosign
i get one of you - - clothesline
pardon how i pardoned it , but don't pardon the part in it
that pointed out the parts that i'm apart from where you parted it
got it through the loop like i'm dippin around the heart of this
skippin over the five
dialin over the narc's mit , seein is believin if you believin what you seein
so you vision it when you was sittin in between the speakers
speakin like i moulded it , one rib scopeded it
shook em off of syllables , i ain't have to motive it
throwin out frisbees , show me you can catch it
show me you can catch it , show me you can catch it , catch it ( x3 )
show me that you caught that , show me that you caught that
show me that you caught that , and i could throw some more back
throwin out frisbees , show me you can catch it
show me you can catch it , show me you can catch it , catch it ( x3 )
show me that you caught that , show me that you caught that
show me that you caught that , and i could throw some more back
another ! llmind production........ ( fade out )
