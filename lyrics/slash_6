you niggas sick , but it's not the measles
i'm slangin' hard rock nigga , flock of seagulls
when this shit drop it's gonna shock the people
like barack hit the block lettin' off the eagle
i even had that white boy , ben stiller
chinese minx , call her chinchilla
when you drop that shit , niggas didn't feel ya'
that whack shit didn't phase me , but it did kill ya'
swear to god i never needed a rap manual
all i needed was some mary jane and some jack daniels
on my mama , i always been a rap vandal
smack a whack nigga to death with an axe handle
while you sittin' around lollygaggin'
i'm rollin' chronic out the bag - put the molly shag in
man these niggas out here hardly rappin'
i come through and bless the mic in a godly fashion
so , necessary that you respect a don
especially if he's on another echelon
i come through , with nothing but the freshest on
wear it once and then it's trash , like a ke$ha song
yeah ! not an ave you never catch us on
you niggas is cosmetic as revlon
i was the broke kid that never had a megatron
stole it from the rich kids , that's why we couldn't get along
west coast originator , never been an imitator
full - blown , acetone microphone disintegrator
uh , i get ignorant in the midst of danger
inventive , considered the innovator
where i'm , from we don't screw and chop shit
they come through wearin' red and blue where we pop clips
uh , and i be higher than a cockpit
let the chop spit hollow tips out his top lip
this is the sound of an underground renegade
who wears a crown and isn't down to catch any fade
bwah , you ain't ballin' go get a bit of change
smooth criminal , hit a nigga through his window pane
and i was put here to put fear in suss niggas
nobody shook here , we don't give a fuck , nigga
yeah ! drug dealers , slup peelers
mention it to my mug nigga , fuck twitter
gangbangers , thug niggas , nerds to the geeks
all respect the way i put these words to the beat
in other words he's a beast every verse he completes
bad bitches , actresses , even birds give him beak
and the music that we make help the kids in the ghetto grow
fightin' for they're freedoms so they keep up out the federal
uh , the name's embedded somebody let 'em know
always stay perpetual flow , so i forever glow
fashawnin' on these niggas , straight up out the fc
catch me with the baddest bitch burnin' up the best trees
or probably on some jet - skis , i hustle collect cheese
last time you saw a check was on your sb's
yeah ! respect over everything
murs and fashawn , bet you've never seen a better team
