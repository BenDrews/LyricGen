i was in amsterdam with my ex - girlfriend
she was passed out , it was mad late
i was mad lost , she was naked
i was staring at her tattoos and i couldn’t take it ( because )
something dark taken its toll
i’d been rolling with the devil i’d been selling my soul
like a rock cliche i felt so alone
i cried myself to sleep and dreamt i was home
not about to go get tangled on a bitty i’ve finagled
many hearts and ladies it’s been clear
since hip - hop brought me here
i felt like francis bacon , hope that i’m not mistaken
mouth open with the eyes scratched out
that’s how i felt when she told me god was dead
god’s not dead , he’s been hiding
god’s not dead , he’s been hiding
god’s not dead , he’s been hiding
god’s not dead , he’s been hiding
at the amsterdam airport we said goodbye
all this time i’d been seeing we’d been living a lie
and i never felt freer than i had in my life
when i left her that day we flew home on different flights
i stopped in spain for a week
i found myself in gaudi’s architecture – barcelona was a treat
frances bacon at el museo del prado
up in madrid , felt like i won the lotto
the post - war painter spoke to me
with a pain in his brush strokes vocally
and a crisis in faith that he showed to me
not a joke to me , well hopefully
because i’d been living with a buddhist nihilist
suicide girl artist love tatted on her lip
and on her on hips i had everything , hip - hop had brought me
i thought back to that day in february when she lost me
i said “god loves you , ” she shook her head
that’s when it all became clear
( slash slash ) i’m a get that canvas
( slash slash ) better understand this
( slash slash ) like francis bacon
( slash slash ) this is all i’m saying
( slash slash ) take your dark - ass world
( slash slash ) move back home girl
( slash slash ) ‘cause i don’t have time
to watch you try to breed your demons with mine
and he’s like…
hold up , i speak in the quiet
while you’re sleeping underneath your eyelids
i’m alive in the silence , where it seems i’ve been hiding
but there’s no denying , that it’s painfully lonely
and you’re waiting for like , “show me ! ”
though you may not know yet at first glance
you can see my thumbprint on your circumstance
and i’ll give you everything you need
grace and mercy and the air you breathe
the clarity to see , the ears to hear
but there’s so much noise that seems to interfere
without pain you’d never know love
there’s not a trial you can’t overcome
when you feel exhausted ready to give up
remember that i’m here like i always was
