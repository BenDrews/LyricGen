yeah , jd man i see sometimes
i sit and wonder when i think about these written rhymes
how'd i get to the point constantly taking all my time ?
time i could of been spending gettin' cash , gettin' mine
hoping one day it comes around
one day when i'm
the nigga gettin' money , gettin' cash , gettin' signed
getting the fuck out the ghetto , cause i'm tired of crime
but it's a crime that i feel this fucking way sometimes
but sometimes i feel like this shit here's a waste of time
