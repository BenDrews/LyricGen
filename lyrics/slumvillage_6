yo el and 'tin kill'n em , 3 kill'n 'em
you thought we broke up but we was just reassemblin'
ladies and gentlemen , you bear witnessin
the villa on some classic shit like vans emblems
it's the guerrilla pimps , we bustin denim in the club
that you can't wear your denim in
freakin a rhyme til every line ends with a then and than
you don't wanna rump and stomp in timberlands
shout to my nigga killagan
and all of my peeps that rep more d than 12 eminems
who let the dogs out and let dilla in ?
fuck with this is ya loss gilligan
sounds similar i'm not feelin 'em
get the balls like venus in wimbelon
while i'm in them fly whips five will and them
on some kim and them all about the benjamins
still here
still here , never left , just switched the style up
came through , made moves to get the crowd up
its hard time , " v " time , nigga your times up
get rowed up for the reunion
el kill'n em , dilla kill'n 'em
maybe we could hook up again back with 'tin and them
together again like armed forces on some fantastic four or four horsemen
can't do it without your crew boy
guess who boy , comin' through with two boy
nobody but us that rap in a clutch
passed and switched it up like kids in double dutch
some couldn't feel our style or feel our flow
never talked our slang , never walked our road
all they know is these niggas is tainted
don't know about those rovers that candy painted
we've been misquoted , misconstrued , misunderstood , and overused
so we take this time to set the record straight
critics get the di - dick , we did it anyway
now you hear our raps with dilla and you all on our team
till you heard 'tin was gone was apart of the scheme
see !
we still got love where was you at at ?
cause a nigga go solo , think we turn our backs
maybe we will reunite on some shit like that
but i gotta set it straight 'fore you twists the facts nigga
yo 'tin kill'n em , 3 kill'n 'em
you thought we broke up and yeah you right , we really did
i wrote a verse that i recited - it was hot
but i had to rewrite cause i thought we was united and we not
but though all the love that i got for you
partner i picked apart ya words and i'm shocked in the interviews
i been accused of not carin'
when the city threw your furniture out
it's not fair when i'm learnin' about how stressed you feel in a article
forget a rhyme , i'm just as real when i talk to you
and you know that we share kodak moments
i wish we could go back
but don't act like you wasn't buggin' out like a phone tap
chasin' cars in the street
i saw you throw up hard in the sink
then after hit the bar for a drink , who asked you to slow down
even though niggas told me you was gon' clown
but i tried , and you know i cried when i saw you wild'n at the state theater
near the door by the side
went to throw you in the trunk and find a preacher for you
cause i thought you had unlawful demons on you
sinkin fast in the deepest soil
your parents finally got you some help
you came out seemin' normal and
i heard you on medication
had an illness you couldn't heal with herbs and meditation
and believe me , me and t3 kept it low
take this as a diss , this is just to let you know that i love you
but watch the company you keep
swearin' niggas don't care , but they love you in the streets
get your mind right nigga
