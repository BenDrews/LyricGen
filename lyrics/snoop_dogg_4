as i look up at the sky
my mind starts tripping
a tear drops my eye
my body temperature falls
i'm shaking and they breaking trying to save the dogg
pumping on my chest and i'm screaming
i stop breathing , damn i see demons
dear god , i wonder can you save me
i can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
i think it's too late for praying , hold up
a voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
( bring your lifestyle to me , i'll make it better )
how long will i live ?
( eternal life and forever )
and will i be the g that i was ?
( i'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
so relax your soul , let me take control
close your eyes my son )
my eyes are closed
murder
murder was the case that they gave me
murder
murder was the case that they gave me
i'm fresh up out my coma
i got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner
it's gonna take a miracle they say
for me to walk again and talk again but anyway
i get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
and everything that nigga said came to reality
living like a baller loc
having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
i bought my momma a benz , and bought my boo boo a jag
and now i'm rolling in a nine - trizzay el do - rag
( just remember who changed your mind
cause when you start set - tripping , that ass is mine )
indeed , agreed proceed to smoke weed
never have a want , never have a need
they say i'm greedy but i still want mo'
cuz my eyes wanna journey some mo' , really doe ( check it out )
now i lay me down to sleep
i pray the lord , my soul to keep
if i should die , before i wake
i pray the lord , my soul to take
no more indo , gin and juice
i'm on my way to chino , rolling on the grey goose
shackled from head to toe
twenty - five with an izz - el , with nowhere to gizzo , i know
them niggas from the other side recognize my face
cause it's the o.g. d - o - double - g , l - b - c
mad dogging niggas cause i don't care
red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
niggas stare as i enter the center
they send me to a level three yard , that's where i stay
late night i hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
niggas getting they shanks , just in case the war , pops off
cause you can't tell what's next
my little homie baby boo took a pencil in his neck
and he probably won't make it to see twenty - two
i put that on my momma ; i'ma ride for you baby boo
murder
murder was the case that they gave me
murder
murder was the case that they gave me
