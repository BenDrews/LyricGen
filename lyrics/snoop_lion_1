fresh trees , young seeds all tryin to find the light
stretchin out their limbs to the sun , acting right
help them keep their life on track

we keep planting these seeds
watch them grow a new breed
cultivating these trees
the cycle carrys on
and on and on and on , it don't stop
the tick tock of universal clock
to the bang bang boogie of the life streaming through me
and the songs that wait while we procreate ( sex )
smoke the weed , everyday
