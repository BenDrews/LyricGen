days like these are days i love
runnin round going nowhere
glad i get to steal all your time
smilin cuz i know that i’m the one that makes you smile
love the way you say my name
and how you laugh at all the stupid things i say
it’s all lovin` , no hate
hangin with you while you're hangin` , hangin` on my arm ( and i like it )
your hand on my back while we drivin` , drivin` in my car ( and i like it )
this is the good , good
this is what people look all their lives to find
and baby we found it
right on time
this is the good , good
and now that we got it
we gotta keep it going strong going strong
gotta keep it going on ( yeah )
keep it strong keep it keep it going on ( yeah )
keep it strong keep it keep it going on ( yeah )
anytime i’m feeling alone
there’ll be a text from you on my phone
just to say you’re thinking of me
and when we are apart i know it’s only me you see
love the way you have my back
and how when i make no sense
you still understand
when nobody else can
hangin with you when you're hangin hangin on my arm ( and i like it )
your hand on my hand while we kissin kissin in the dark ( and i like it )
all this love
is the best drug there could ever be
and i get high on you and me
anyone can see
this is the good , good
this is the good , good
this is what people look all their lives to find
and baby we found it
right on time
this is the good , good
and now that we got it
we gotta keep it going strong keep it strong
keep it keep it goin` on ( yeah )
keep it strong keep it keep it goin` on ( yeah )
keep it strong keep it keep it goin` on ( yeah )
this is the good , good
