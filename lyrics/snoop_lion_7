when it's over now , nothing left for the enemy
when the show goes down and you silence the melody , that's when you say
i’ll be that sound boy in miami , rude boy you in the kingston
bad boy in new england , new york the whole kingdom
i ain’t got the remedy
don’t wonder that from me you see i'm ready see
i'm living in the sin it’s how it’s gonna be
i heard a voice that said it would die for me , die for me , die for me
wadadadang wadadadadang
well you coming on the dance and now we shaped up our game
wadadadang wadadadadang
and you know we never ever stop beat them to the end
see them on top on them , willing them , killing them and then one after
see it then , run to it when nobody asked to be drop off
when we on my bred snoop lion , meets his blessing love and honour
to what we are apart and to what we are even , you know say it all we all prosper
news flash flick a little ash , every website and blog
snoop and busa in the studio , banging out hits , eat little bit of snapper
don't ever get it twisted , see we gifted when togheter
reincarnated snoop lion , selassie i forever
somebody help me wake up and make it rain on my head
let it rain , let it rain , let it rain on my head
set me free , so complete , everything must come to end
let it breathe
when the background clears and you're the one standing there
you're running out of time , you're praying that you make a hit
whatever they do , whatever they do to you
whatever they say , whatever they say to you too bad
sound off in that paris
roll call in lebanon
bandoleros in the mexico
can you hear me , the whole kingdom ?
