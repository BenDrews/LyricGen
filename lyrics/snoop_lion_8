this one ya hear
fruit juice
number one you know me can’t lose
inna my garden me pick the fruit that me choose
fruit juice in my glass you know me can’t lose
take away my worry , my stress , and my blues
higher level natural vibes are what me give dem
my princess say she love it when we ride pon rhythm
natural berries are so very good for the system
some tart , some sweet , you just can’t resist them
sweetsop , neesberries , cantaloupes , soursop
pineapple , mango , my taste buds tango
an ice cold beverage in my honeycomb hideout
chillin’ with my beautiful empress we a standout
she sip the beet juice , said she really love the medicine
drink it down slow feel the good vibe settling
the way the flavors going down
she ordered up another round
tell me that she feel alright
natural juices over sprite
feel the guava juice
she have a healthy appetite
no drink the red bull
because she don’t believe the hype
