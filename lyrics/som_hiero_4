oh black man
oh black man
ashy elbows and lupiderm
replace the fact with some propaganda for you to learn
history lost inside the walls of egypt , so hieroglyphics don't teach a white teachers curriculum
hourglasses and hourglasses
simulation is vacant with bodies in the news
so you rely on sativas to get you in the mood
spend a five on scratch - offs to get a dollar back ?
make an investment to stay in debt and take pride in that ?
old black man , old jiggaboo , old porch monkey , old africoon
the self - esteem adopted from fields of cotton we bagged and moved
the run away and the german shephards to sic em all
blood on the leaves , niggas hang from a sycamore
old black man , old jiggaboo
why can't you be monogamous , why can't you stay in school ?
why you don't have a saviors , why you by tennis shoes ?
why you buy pistol before a suit for an interview
see uncle sam said i wouldn't make it to 22 specializing in lots of the songs of life in the interlude , wait
suffered years of profanity , generational curse
parents for lack of knowledge can't elevate in a hearse
histories in our histories drowning in propaganda
everyone's apprehensive to go and search for the answers
we ain't got 'em sway , but we can go to praise
go see strippers bi - weekly to give it all away
i pray to god today , it's getting crazy ain't it ?
to be a man in a world that's been fully automated
i'm tryna educate my people and bring it back to basics
see old black man , old jiggaboo
that same disease that's affected me has affected you
why you rely on a system that won't do shit for you ?
are you allowing these gmos to get into you ?
endorse the china man , know that chicken ain't really food
allowing needles with vaccinations to kill the youth
i speak my truth
grant you permission for my assassination
see my demise is my emancipation
die everyday for my freedom
freedom from labels that i wore due to people's opinions
misconstrue my passion for gimmicks
i'm calibrating my mind , see the vision through different lenses , aye
apply yourself to supply your wealth
expand your mind without you relying on no one else
god speed
