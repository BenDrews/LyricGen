i had to make a couple bands for the come up
got kicked out the house , i had no option
i was going through it with my mama
ju - juggin and finnesin' had to play it raw
smoking weed dodging feds cause my head hard
when i dropped out i said fuck all of y'all
imagine pulling up to your school in the best car
i was born in 94 i got the tattoo

started out with nothing , i was hungry

my belt cost more than your check
i'm throwing all this money like brett
i know i make ya girl so wet
i know this pussy nigga upset
i'm winning i'm winning you lose
that's your fault should have never snoozed

started out with nothing , i was hungry
now i got a couple niggas' bitches on me
fuck nigga , i don't wanna be your homie
i had to make a couple bands by my lonely
