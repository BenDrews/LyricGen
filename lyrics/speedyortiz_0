you didn't know me when you were a kid
in trouble at school , alone at lunch again
i didn't know you when i broke my knee
spent the summer on crutches and everybody teased
except for this one friend i almost forgot
you didn't know me , but he knew me best
the weight of my brain and the fear of my cold head
you never saw me , interred in the ice
my friend tried to melt , but he couldn't thaw me out right
so i got ditched freezing , alone with my thoughts
and though i once said i was better off just being dead
better off just being dead , without my old friend
true , i once said , i was better off just being dead
but i didn't know you yet
you didn't know me , but you got cold , too
and your mind was heavy , and you thought you might lose it
well everything fucked up we both felt before
i'm glad for it all if it got us where we are
with you in the boat there , i almost forgot
how i once said i was better off just being dead
better off just being dead , i didn't know you yet
and you might've said , you were better off just being dead
but i'm looking out for you , my friend , i'm looking
i didn't know you when you were a kid
but swimming with you , it sure feels like i did
