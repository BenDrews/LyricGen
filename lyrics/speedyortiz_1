heaven , have mercy on the hypnic jerk you blame for your speech
walk around the block again
wait 'til i feel cool and straight
with a diaristic bent on undertaking
careful , steady
are we steady ?
cruel and ready
i'm not bossy , i'm the boss
shooter , not the shot
on the tip and fit to execute
i'm chief , not the overthrown
captain , not a crony
so if you wanna row , you better have an awfully big boat
holding a package from a total stranger who claims to know me
naw , you never knew me , man , not even a fraction
you just glimpsed your own reflection in a gold sheen
i'm not bossy , i'm the boss
shooter , not the shot
well - composed with keys to raise the skate
i'm chief , not the overthrown
captain , not a crony
so if you wanna throw , you better have an awfully big stone
we could hang out for the summer while you wait for your girl
dip a toe 'til it's soaked and freezing
but just because i let you kill time dangling me from the quarry
doesn't mean that i won't land on my feet
that's cause i'm the boss
caller of the shots
sutanejo , never spit to me
chief , play my own right hand
not haggish , but the hag
how na√Øve to trample
she who's running from the stampede
i'm raising the skate
look , i'm raising the skate
