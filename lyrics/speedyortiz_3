was it the teeth or my tongue that said , " glue shut your lips , let us take a rest " ?
oh , my mouth is a factory for every toxic part of speech i spew
late , languorous , and afraid to ask
caught my reflection in some seawashed glass
oh , my face is unable to convey how very awfully i'm doing
laugh out of habit at the lump schematics
i smoked my senses , it made me so demented
i see me and you with the kennel cough
signaling the sleuth of the trail we trot
expansion rattles out this old lump
bats get bristled , the imps heat up
spoon out the sweet stuff for street - wise smut
oh , my gut absorbs the fiercest blows , you never thought you'd have to throw
laugh out of habit at the lump schematics
my psychic tenses make me so defensive
i see me and you in the tiger tank
swimmin' as they yowl , soon they're tearing us
limb from every limb to the kennel cough
limb from every limb to the - -
don't even care if they take my legs
i've limped before , i could limp again
though my limp is not able to display how very awfully i'm doing
