who's out triggering the soft alarm
barbed the entrance : now i wanna know
who's there feeding ?
i want a name , i want a name
just mouth it , that's fine
the hollow throws its lousy drone
and you don't want to breathe
but you'll talk
now absolute the zero count
zero morphism , its arrowed frame
whose count's empty ?
i want a name , i want your name
just write it , that's fine
the strength you've grown is monotone
but now i've turned the key
and you can't call out again
gather 'round so empty now
all you got is spineless sound
i want the truth
even if i gotta rip it from you
who's out feeding ? i fed the same
so they took my name
and i put up no fight
the void you throw is all you know
you watch me turn a key
how like you , to shirk away
a sonar's rounds
me , i just cloister up against its shouts
but you've still got your sound
and i see you staring down
i want a name
even though you spolied the one i came with
