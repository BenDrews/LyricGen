place every bet on a hard horse
he won't go down
though his knees spasm
though he wants to grey out
i heard them call me a hard horse
if you can stomach the top speed , let's take it on
your fever's fewer than before and so it's hard to get hot
is that a challenge or something ?
i'm never wrong about one thing
you're sick
keep below , i don't wanna throw you
sick
now you know that i wanna know you
don't endure a sickness you could let me cure
and i want to
i set my crucible fawning in a predatory way
you've got a habit with stains ; i study etymology
but i never succumbed to that dirty word till i met you
now i'm sick
keep below , i don't wanna throw you
sick
now you know that i wanna know you
in this blood a sickness you could learn to love
and i'll learn , too
sell every bet on your hard horse
i won't go down
though my knees spasm
though i want to grey out
and you could call me a hard horse
but keep below , i don't wanna throw you
sick
now you know that i wanna know you
in this blood a sickness you could learn to love
and i'll learn , too
