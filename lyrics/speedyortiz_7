as up above then so below
who pays ?
rat king of the ward
fell slack on the course
then silvered away
what does he retain ?
he can't remember a thing , fleeing the chalk of his mess
all of the smart ones repress
they get amnesia
and now i wanna forget
i loved someone who left me for dead
what a night to forget
only an empty head says , " i wanna be with somebody. "
it went below
and as i foretold
you'll pay
how wisely he roars
the chariot lord
dragged every which way
tell me , what do you retain ?
you can't remember a thing
torn between too many heads
all of the bad ones repress
they get amnesia
and now i wanna forget
i loved someone who left me for dead
i want amnesia just to please you again
here goes another empty threat :
i wanna be with somebody just like me
someone who laughs at a crashed car rental
someone who hurts in an accident
someone as scared of abandonment
and all i’ll ever do is untie all your knots , dissolve all your thoughts
and all i’ll ever do is untie all your knots , dissolve all your thoughts
i wanna be with somebody just like me , somebody just like me
i wanna be with somebody just like me , somebody just like me
i'll do all this if you pay me
