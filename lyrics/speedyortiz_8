better yet , better get jealous of what didn’t get your name
better you fake the truth
i tried to buy an aluminum toy from the booth outside the dojo
with a ten buck coin from your old drawer
don’t even know what you’ve been up to
since the time you said i never saw the real you
brain like a sphinx and a vest like a townie
i got you , but if you ever saw me
i go riding in cars but i’m not the driver
riding in cars , now i’m the bad girl you wanted
pull the shades. make the call. get the feds crawling through the lawn
i got smoke in my iris
backwater acid bath for riddle - rousing cowards
better me than you’ve ever seen
brain like a sphinx and a vest like a townie
if these are my last words , guess you found me
i go riding in cars but i’m not the driver
riding in cars , now i’m the dead girl you wanted
don’t even know what you’ve been up to
and the me that you knew , that was some other me
brain like a sphinx but got nails like a prom queen
stay on the bleachers , from there you can watch me
go riding in cars , but i’m not the driver
riding in cars , more like the dead girl you wanted
riding in cars and you’re not the driver
forever and overly gone
