well it's not what you think
but it is that thought which brought you into this web
full of bees , found you in the glue and began their stinging
who could have guessed you'd be out on a stretcher
after your home stretch ?
all pocked and bruised
and they still you here at least 'til the fit's through
they trust you just to your own feet
and keep you here for a whole week
cause you're acting strap - down crazy
they keep you here for a whole week
the state house is a trafficked spot
you kick your dirty feet upon
then that web with all those bees
got your poor legs sticky , oh what a bad scene
who could've guessed
you'd be down for a spell , blood out on a new bed
figured you'd know
i would put the kid in me and wouldn't let him go
trust me just to my own feet
and keep me up for a whole week
baby i feel so crazy
you keep me up for a whole week
