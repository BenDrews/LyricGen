verse 1 :
man i’m strong with the faith , gotta dinner with fate
but can’t procrastinate , like a release date
you weak , i break fast like when i eat dates
n ya boi rock the beat jus for pete’s sake
21 bars and older bus flow is sober
n yall music smell like ya stomach bloat
my brain could soak , up a heat stroke
soul never overdose , i jus press play to leave ya comatose
im finna blow the charts like a c4 , spit weezy i’m asthmatic
spit semi - automatic , auto pilot through the traffic
auto - magic n i’m tryna go all the way
i drop a dime like i’m 10 of penny hardaway
i jus give my heart away n pump it like an artery
ra ra ramadan mubarak
guarantee errbody fasting
ramada ramadan with the flow
verse 2 :
get ready… for sahuur
im the real shit not manure
im flowin deeper than the sewer
you can’t fight the allure , ain’t no cure
jus lemmi give u the tour , my game is sharp like a skewer
i will let you endure , this something is jus so pure
the beats i puree , tyrna save the game start a parade
i spit like rainfall , swing the mic like a chainball , they welcome me back like mace
i'm a master like windu , i blow could blow ya over like the wind do
a tornado , one breath could clear it up like draino
i can’t find it my brain lost in disorder
cuz my stay mind hostile like the indo - paki border
ra ra ramadan mubarak
guarantee errbody fasting
ramada ramadan with the flow
verse 3 :
get ready… for iftar , tear it up like reptar
use the mic like a scimitar , who’s iller there’s no other
my revelation divine like laylat al - qadr
kicking gludious maximus
gladiator with the mic , i’m maximus , mack on the game miraculous
malicious flow could mutilate a million melodies
while yo bars been rustin for like 100 centuries
my entities , they adoring , mouth open wide like i’m yonin
cuz i fast while you snoring , but really i ain't ate since like 5 in the morning
we jus mourning for the muslims lost or torn apart , so ramadaan mubarak
just know i got the game locked down like hosni mubarak
