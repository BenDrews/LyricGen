i been dreamin' all my life
now i'm fuckin feel different
shawty gettin' low all night
somethin different than i'm sippin'
sorry hater had to do it
said i couldn't had to prove it
now i'm fuckin' feelin' right
now i'm livin' fuckin' life
i been eating like a predator , run my city like a senator
money calling on my cellular , boy i'm hotter than the temperature
i might go and get my bezzle up , i might go and get my cheddar up
they was saying i would never run
i might fuck around and level up
( x2 )
i might fuck around and level up , in the paper like an editor
serve these hoes just like federer , all that fame gon' be etc
got three bitches in the backseat
hurdle pussy like a track meet
boy i'm hungry for it all
i ain't talkin' bout that crabmeat
all my homies got the hook up
now i'm saucin' when i cook up
used to tell me get my books up
now they see me when they look up
i be ridin' with the tint low , unless i' m ridin' in the limo
dancing big at the disco , oh this shit is just the intro
it's so different here on this side , i be blowin' on extendos shawty blow me like nintendo , chevy level up to benzos
boy i'm ridin' with my kinfolk , i do all this for my family
pull a bitch while walking casually , drop a song collect the casualties
want that fantasy for my life
shawty scrollin' on her timeline
i can see more than my eyesight
boy i'm living like the highlights
all i needed was a chance , all i needed was a glance , all i wanted was the bands , all i had was just a plan , big plans to be the man
shawty like to pop em xans , can't be poppin' in the stands , i'm just out here on the field , i'm just dealing with my hand
girl you dealing with the man
i been dreamin' all my life
now i'm fuckin feel different
shawty gettin' low all night
somethin different than im sippin'
sorry hater had to do it
said i couldn't had to prove it
now i'm fuckin' feelin' right
now i'm livin' fuckin' life
i been eating like a predator , run my city like a senator
money calling on my cellular , boy i'm hotter than the temperature
i might go and get my bezzle up , i might go and get my cheddar up
they was saying i would never run
i might fuck around and level up
( x2 )
i been winning outta style
i been sinking in the clouds
they were thinking i'm a clown
what you thinkin of me now ? !
i was out now im back at it , all these bitches looking back at it working hard i don't lack practice , music got me like a crack addict
saw the rap took a crack at it , found out i wasn't bad at it
