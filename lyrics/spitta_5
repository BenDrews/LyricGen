eid mubarak , my brother eid mubarak
they told me dumb down just to open up my market
all the advice i toss it cuz i know the angles in the heavens
stay knockin haas spitta , they bumpin it with the prophets
that's the only audience i'm tryna target
awake from hibernation , they say i'm too ambitious
sights i set i couldn't hit it , bar i set couldn't get over it
well maybe so , i'm over it
now i'm focused on the hopeless kids
who ain't never seen a present
i give you this , come and open it
i thought i had a gift , but yall don't seem to cherish it
so i'm - fleein the scene in my chariot
cuz i swear the day of judgment comin if
this shit is the music that you call talented
some people get less then they deserve
some get more than they worth so i
guess the world is still in balance then
this for martyred men who ain't have a place to pray
only showers were grenades , allah built you a palace in
heaven , this that milk and honey flow sip your chalice man
do you believe
from allah i was conceived
this somethin for my deen
somethin for my muslimeen to believe in
no nasheed just some sympathy for the bleedin
for my brothers
if we bleed the same color then i'm grevin
this my land tell the world we ain't leavin
tell the world we ain't leavin
i'll admit it , i ain't got what you need
all got is food for thought for a mother with 100 kids to feed
i see yall tryna feast , ya ya eid mubarak
but ramadan never ended for me man i'm stavin
so i'm comin at every rappers throat
might have to sacrifice one of goat's
like it's eid al - adha
fed a whole village but they said the meat was sub par
swear i'm subzero with the flow man
i put that on god and i put that on gaza
on the other side of the wall the
israelis got a shoppin center and a plaza
you think they got a haas sweatshirt in the mall bruh ? ?
astughfirrallah you really think i'm just tryna make a profit
i'm tryna be a prophet
i'm tryna see the goblin of fire in my heart
don't yall see i had desire from the start
you really think i fell off
i was workin in the dark til alarm clock pop
that's why i ain't drop shit for 3 years
thats just how long it took for charmeleon to evolve
fuck it charizard here , i scorch beats guarantee the chars are here
the jinn all fear me
i went to the gates of hell and i sprayed off raps
ramadan over n the shaytan back
devil said can't handle this kid lord chain me back
lord chain me back !
