girl : soon you'll have a band
mr. eon : it's just my voice and this hand
girl : that's what hip hop was and still stands
eon : what

verse 1 :
death to the mic , starbuck's on arrival
raised in illadel where i wrecked the recital
introduced jack daniels to mary jane
now they dating in my body , shit ain't the same
your petty thinking cat need training like amtrak
can't stand that , need to abandon that
catch a random violent act , over a phantom track
with zoot suits and hammer pants , we ain't wearin' that
swearin' that they nice , when i'm vastly , more nasty
trashy , trying to be all cute and dashing
to alien crafts , i'm unabductible
my visionary path is unobstructible
with the dope we on , ma look like a pokemon
arsenic laced lyrics that you choking on
catch my illest tale up on story boards
like my latest smorgasbord with 40 whores
chorus :
high & mighty nicest , too hot spittable
mr. eon's frequency's untrasmittible
come around the way , we don't act hospitable
can't see us , so on stage we invisible
( repeat )
verse 2 :
killed billy blanks with tae - bo , puffin' hydro
but guess what kids ? , i wasn't even high though
a thousand thirty words can't describe my sturdy turds
absurd , like 30 nerds doing the dirty bird , in atlanta
trash , skidded up pampers
looking like some old washed up exotic dancers
trains get sprayed like high schoolers these days
they don't listen to hip hop , they checkin' green day
my unexpectedness is like the '69 mets
my 69 wets on my penthouse pets
a mic , better snatch it
record , gotta scratch it
a loop , better catch it
the blunt , better ash it
who wanna see me erupt ?
like i had beans , tacos , pizza and chinese for lunch
watch me daydream about tyra's vagina
take a vh to it , catch me in the all nighter
chorus
verse 3 :
i'm the illest one , i'll smoke l's for 50 years
catch emphysema , then sue phillie blunts
really stunts , no need for elaborate tactics
just lick your lips and presto ! , it's my mattress
electrocute you in wet clothing articles
send your air particles to the antarcticas
with no bubble nauticas , no fleeces
more popular in brooklyn than pee wee reese is
more infamous in l.i. than colin ferguson
more hated uptown that mayor rudy son
i'm david berkowitz , when i be spurtin' this
son of sam on this here diagram
fuck immaculate conception , i was anakin's dad
took the book to amsterdam , now the vatican's sad
see my , boys are nuts ill ploys on cuts
your mattels can't swell , you be toys'r'us
chorus
outro :
yes indeed , too hot
the spittablest , mr. eon
yes indeed , dick starbuck
comin' through once again
dj mighti mi , henry spitty
