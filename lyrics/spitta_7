simon brathwaite ( verse 1 )
unhh spit like ima big man
left you in the dust no right hand
no mgm but we is grand
and no b**** n***** in the clan
dats b - gang we important
you new to rap like a tourist
you keep getting more boring
but my words keep on pouring
its strong b on the beat
locked in the game like a car key
rap so retarded
i always leave a mark no sharpie
n***** always tryna start me
but i'm in ignition neva parking
you mad tight like an apartment
u just like a dog , stop barking
i'm spittin ill , imma ill spitter
f*** you , middle finga
shooting up the beats , dats a trigga finga
feasting on the beats , call it dinner
spit game is so vital
the rap game's like survival
i got the title
no more walking on the tight rope
i speeding past like a cheetah
kick b**** n***** away no fifa
my life's full of leisure
and i'm heating up like a heater
its strong don't forget the name
im coming straight for the money and the fame
and that's simon
