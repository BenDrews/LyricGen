good lookin' so refined
say wouldn't you like to know what's going on
in my mind , so let me get right to the point
i don't park my car for every guy i see
big big spender , spend a little time with me
big spender i am that
i'm too hot where the fans at
i'm too fly where i land at
just sit back and kick back
if you didn't know me you should just know that i get racks
no crack but i rock , man i'm just like where chris at
big timer to a big spender , a little check to a big tipper
we're stars like the big dipper , ain't none of ya'll better than spitta
from nothing i became something , on you rappers i'm just lunching
i ain't never move crack , but i can keep your bass bumping
taking off like a rocket , my swag you better watch it
man i'm a big spender and i got money all in my pocket
i'm 14 & ; im bossin' , no teeth but i'm flossin'
they say i found my hustle but i'm sure i never lost it
good lookin' so refined
say wouldn't you like to know what's going on
in my mind , so let me get right to the point
i don't park my car for every guy i see
big big spender , spend a little time with me
beat the beat like ali , and yes i'm really cocky
i'm all about my dough , so ya'll haters can't even knock me
rappers get your shine while these few hours pass
it's spitta haze time your time is up in that hourglass
he the next weezy or he the next jay - z
you go through phases in life but you haters don't phase me
i'm too far gone like drake , i'm too real ya'll fake
i'm all about my bills , my last name should be gates
i play hard but i work harder , you living life i'm living larger
say i made the game , they saying haze you are the father
you guys are hilarious , man i'm not even hearing it
go harder than the rest , i'll leave it point blank and a period
