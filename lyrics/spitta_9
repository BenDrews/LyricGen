verse 1 :
listen amateur i multiply track like parameters
my temperature can’t be measured in fahrenheit
my voice build like levels of paradise
i’m addicted to the cyph , no regards for human life
so me and lbj bumbin watch the throne while i burn ya nervous system down like ancient rome
lemmi jus ensure , pure white like ensure
i’m fresher than kosher , better respect my culture
lick off my plate ya lazy ass vulture
i keep workin , grinding , needa multure
for the hip - hop innovator , renovator , chosen one
that must be me , nothing into somethin like a muster seed
you can’t touch my sheen , that’s how my luster be
i’m sub - degree but hotter than three cups of tea
cuz i’m cold as himalayas with the super soaker sprayer
verse 2 :
study like a scientist so i know the game is bleak
i'm a podiatrist so examine yo defeat , mc’s is weak , yall too petite
i make mincemeat , and conquer like anglo - saxons
spit wit passion , you ain’t a fraction of my essence
i’m the quintessence of rhyme attraction
leave ya brain with lactic acid , smooth assassin faction closing in faster than claxton
or aroldis chapman zippin it pass ya helmet
rock ya like elvis , now i got ya head bobbin like a fuckin' hooker’s pelvic
better listen close cuz i know you hoes deft and ya vision impaired
but i’m mos definitely up in the air
and my suc - cess ain’t up in the air
but i will leave ya shakin like snare drums
now ya need tums to stomach my shit , that you could smell farther than slave ship
n everytime i spit , abu - labab be rolling in his grave
remind him of his whip , firm grip when i crack the back of the beat , crying for pacifist reach
verse 3 :
i'm no prophet but , this the prophecy
tell the proctor he
better be cautious when he talkin to the prodigy
the light breaths within me i'm tryna toss the sheath
the marksman heat , rockin beats with sharp physique
that'll leave ya whole legion famished
brandished my talents from the dark i'm a
slave of god , i wonder what he branded on my heart
professor of the arts , carry
provokin' thoughts from the clouds i'm a descendant
cool under pressure like abraham thrown in the flames
and emerged without a blemish
our idols finally became the true menace
a lion born in the heat of the flames comin' off my sentence
eyes closed chakras open , they say i'm too lyrical
hard body in the physical world
but soft heart in the spiritual
listen close you can hear my soul bleedin'
every rhyme you can hear my soul speakin'
it's a paper thin line between givin' and receivin'
it's like the people lost the last page of the qur'an
it's hidden at the border line between our nations
we'll never unify
so i close my eyes and awake from hibernation
my voice paitin' the magnum opus
eyes closed chakras open
the picture blurred but i'm focused
everybody got a path to choose i chose mine
but the rap game walkin' the line between dead and ruffied
and need new knees like greg oden
