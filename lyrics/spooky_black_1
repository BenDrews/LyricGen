now that i’m gone , i know that you hear it
now that i'm gone , i know that you see me
oh , oh , oh , oh
now that i’m gone , i know that you care
i see how you're caring now
oh , oh , oh , oh
searching for wrong
so you can point your stubborn finger at me again
at me again
what has become
see all that i did want , was for you to end up so perfect
all i see is just another one
wondering why they don’t see me
better off if i don't tell you baby
if you would even believe it
for all that you keep that we're selling baby
you know that i , oh no , you don’t
i can see it in your eyes , that person that you’re wearing
a faulty disguise
you’re the reason that i hate so
the reason that i hate so
i see the blade in your hand
i see the blade in your hand
what you waiting for ?
i see the blade in your hand
i see the blade in your hand
what you waiting for ?
