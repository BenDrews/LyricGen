gone just as you came through the broken air
now i start to question were you even there
to run my fingers through your fucking hair
girl i see your face everywhere
maybe so suddenly
standing right in front of me
take the gun and baby let me see
make it how its supposed to be
i do this for you
and you run me right through
this was all part of your plan
got just what you wanted , never seen again
lay me down
and close my eyes
send me off into the night
off into the night , oh
baby i would die for you
don't you realize take my life for you
our life only thing important to me , to me
where am i now
since you've gone away from me
you're the only thing i ever see
i can't breath , no
when you're not right next to me
not right next to me
baby i can't breath
baby i can't breath
baby i can't breath , no , no
i can't breath
