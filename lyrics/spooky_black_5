care too much but it doesn't mean a thing
i don't give a fuck just to cope with the pain
i'd take a bullet for you , i'd jump in front of train
but when it comes to me , i wonder would you do the same
tryna' find the words , but it's hard to explain
control how i feel , but it's hard to contain
walk all over me , when we converse
you don't need no comfort , she just want to come first
there's something bout' settling that's so unsettling
i'd almost rather not even feel anything
are these memories even worth remembering
or am i gon be wishin' i could forget everything
i woke up from a black out , thinking back how
my parents didn't last , and they just backed out
and how that affects how i act now
deal with that everyday , like fiends in the crack house
hold it down for my turf , 'til i'm pushing up daisies and tulips
i'll die for this shit , trade my life for a news clip
i live out my dreams , everyday i am lucid
i don't get diluted , amidst the confusion
i stick to the code , see where it goes
the devil he fiend for a piece of my soul
and i sold it like two nicks
had me stuck for so long , now im doing what's best for the movement
baby got me feeling so emotionless
motionless , don't ya see me smokin' this
neck down paralyzed
i can see it in your eyes
you've got me running in place
glock forty - five to my face
can't remember your taste
your lips fucking laced
motionless , motionless , motionless
baby got me motionless
motionless , baby got me motionless
you know you got me fucked up
i know you never meant to hurt none
lot of drugs on the streets nowadays
but girl that pussy is the worst one
said some things i never would have said
i did some things i should have never did
through the ups and the downs , and the highs and the lows , i'm just tryna' keep a level head
upping my budget , i just bought a chain i put that on my mother
they hated before , but now they all love it don't know who to fuck with
they see me , they plotting , they claim me like property , say they my brothers
showed your true colors , you prove i can't trust you , don't fuck with these busters
baby how ya feelin' , what ya smokin' on
the way i see you movin' , must be something strong
tryna' get these thoughts out of my fucking head
don't feel like i'm alive , don't feel like i am dead
can't remember the feeling of your skin
oh this regret , where do i begin
baby let me in , i'm tryna see your fucking face again
