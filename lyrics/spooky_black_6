your eyes grow quite frightening
your eyes grow quite frightening
smokin' on my own now i'm givin' up
i don't feel like i'm alive now i'm givin' up
look into your eyes , just another one
see me in the forest then you better run
black coat , black blade standing in the rain
only see my face in the fuckin' pictures we made
never gave a fuck about me now i'm getting laid
never gave a fuck about getting paid
no you'll never see me , i'll be all alone
smoked out , bout' to die , sitting on my throne
then retreat into the night i never had my phone
tryin' to link up , bitch i'm already gone
so cold when i'm sliding through
all these thoughts i get high to
no i won't even mind you
see i'm alone up in my mind too
your eyes go grey , frightening
your eyes go grey , frightening
