why you gotta act like i ain't gon' remember you ?
you look so damn sexy when you do the things you do
you know you got me sprung
baby come and sing for me
baby be my remedy
show me how it's supposed to be
so i can be your man
i'm running around and i'm thinking about you
you got me talkin' all smooth
baby just be my boo
come on girl tell me the truth
i know you wanna be with spook
