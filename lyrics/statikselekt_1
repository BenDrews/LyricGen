wolves out , baby
my barrel lean like thorazine
dream like reverend king , cream like medell√≠n
cartel sparked well , y'all in the mezzanine
swimming at the shot ball , shot bars , guillotine
a hundred on the dart boards , dark on the big machine
blowing at your entourage , whole squad wolverines
camouflage dons , spits hella steam , prophesize , we monopolize
gotta get the green
backs in my nap sack , roll up a swisher sweet , light a spliff
life's a bitch , freaking off with the team
all the shit i've seen , probably should be dead now
fuck the zombies , smoke the bong , it's weed to the head now
it's the semi - auto blowing through your audio
my niggas press you and leave you in the poorest mode
known movements , this reality music , the gun law is ; if you got one , you better use it
listen , a and b convos , c your way out before d jump over e
and f you up like a g so play silly , feel a 9 milly
acting like you 'bout this life beef for really
face fighting , wanna steal , y'all niggas kill me
deer gang , 215 , it's gucci philly , it's louis loaf with the smoke that beats that
camouflage dons , zombies , statik selekt
if you send shots , we blowing off limbs
no sublims , don't get it twisted , we not them
it's a new wave , nwa , take it how you want it , and it's all i got to say
the fame ain't changed meech , i still don't fuck with you , niggas
i still be on the streets , i still scream fuck religion
i ain't scared of beef , got beef get put on a skillet
you bigots are non - existent so fuck all my competition , hold up
hoes haze , no competition , your mortal vision's sacrilegious spittinng vivid pictures
smoking with the same niggas montana flow
whiter than the white cops that shot the kid on my block
i'm from a place where we want it , we take it
gold teeth , two foes
trapping in the basement
two freaks , one meech , it's threesomes in the am
take a whiff , pure shit , four blunts in one bitch
bodies in the basement
homicide cases
prophesize about multiplying pot like we makers
hater , you ain't on like the lakers
i know i'm wrong but we don't go back to slave ships
smif - n - wesson , one bullet
your pick
third leg , i be putting it in your bitch
rhyme like life after death had a fourth disk
rhyme like all eyez on me times four shit
park place , sheet pins , smoking at the ball game
scott bucks up top only when the knicks play
smif - n - wesson 500 , og and a switch blade
before you cross a dead motherfucker , look both ways
motherfucker , look both ways
motherfucker , look both ways
camouflage dons , camouflage dons
