going global , doing what you don’t expect
who the one ? baby , take a guess , yes , that’s…
i got what you need , i got what you need , need
i got what you need , i got what you need , need
i’m heavenly blessed , she said " let’s get heavenly wet "
but i’m too dedicated to melodies , they sending me checks
music a remedy when my memory be getting stressed
amateurs got my name in they mouth , yeah , they definitely obsessed
chilling with statik selekt up in the lab making hits
they mad at the fact that these rappers acid like a catheter is
got co - signs from cam’ron , bow wow and 50 cent
mac miller , kweli , and i ain’t even famous yet
but still i remain a threat , and yes i am coming for yours
they ducking for cover like everytime that i run in the door
need to lock myself and go through every cupboard and drawer
they say i’m ‘bout to pop like this youngin’ had grease in his pores
i see that they fiending for more with every single track i drop
it could be my worst song , but they still say “that track is hot”
i hope you get paralyzed if you ever hate on the movement
there’s not a single kid my age that could do what i’m doing
yeah , you can twitter talk and pick apart this shit that i’m pursuing
but until you prove it , you losing , you just looking stupid
i swear to god , man , hold up
see i can rap good , but i’m able to murder a hook
and i’m straight from the pits of hell , even a sermon is shook
they say i’m about to get green like i’m giving kermit the look
and i’mma be here permanently , yeah , i’m ‘bout to erupt
counting my luck and blessings , down to bust only sessions
gonna split down the trail mix , i do this every day
