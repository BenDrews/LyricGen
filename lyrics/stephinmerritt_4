forever and a day
we'll dream our lives away
our love is here to stay
marry me
i'll give you every color of the rainbow ;
they'll say it can't be done , but what do they know ?
you'll never be alone
you're my sine qua non
and i'm a baritone
marry me
i'll gaze into your eyes and say i love you
there'll always be a rainbow right above you
forever and a day
we'll watch our children play
i know it's a clich
but i will love you come what may
forever and a day
forever and a day
we'll dream our lives away
i know it's a clich
but i will love you come what may
forever and a day
