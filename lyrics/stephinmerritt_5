you'd better go , or you'll be late for your train
right about now , your husband is raising cain
it's not psychosis , it's just fear
but leave those roses here
maria , maria , maria
maria , maria , maria
will i only love you from afar ?
like loving a cloud , loving a star ?
maria , maria
maria , maria , maria
will you never know how beautiful you are ?
when i said : " why can't we just be together ? "
she waved goodbye , and walked across the heather
and then i took off my disguise
- i wonder if she ever cries
i wonder if she ever knew
her lover was her husband , too
