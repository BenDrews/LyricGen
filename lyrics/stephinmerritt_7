behold the lowly centipede
he undulates and wiggles
to form and poise he pays no heed
he oscillates and wriggles
he wriggles high , he wriggles low
he wrigles far and wide
he wriggles in eye sockets
of ladies who have died
he wriggles in the highest trees
he wriggles in the deep
he wriggles in the dainty ears
of ladies fast asleep
behold the lowly centipede
he crawls hither and thither
of gold and guns he has no need
he only needs to slither
he slithers here , he slithers there
through country , field and town
he slithers in the underwear
of ladies sitting down
he slithers anywhere he likes
wherever passion leads
he slithers into ladies
and makes baby centipedes
