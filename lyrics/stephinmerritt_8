what a fucking lovely day
everything has gone my way
all my flags are unfurled
i'm the king of the world
and to think , it's only may !
it's my favourite time of year
for a spree of crime and fear
it's a joy just to breathe
and to scheme , and to seethe
what a fucking lovely day !
la la la la , la la la...
la la la la la la la...
ah , the smell of despair
is that blood in my hair ?
i don't care , i don't care
what a fucking lovely day !
ooh ooh ooh , ooh ooh ooh ooh...
