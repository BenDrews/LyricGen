so you quote love unquote me
well , stranger things have come to be
but let's agree to disagree
cause i don't believe you
i don't believe you
you tell me i'm not not cute
its truth or falsity is moot
cause honesty's not your strong suit
and i don't believe you
i don't believe you
you tell me of what once was
and all about buck , butch , and buzz
how they were not like me because...
but i don't believe you
i don't believe you
i had a dream and you were in it
the blue of your eyes was infinite
you seemed to be
in love with me
which isn't very realistic
you may sing me " they were you "
and i start crying halfway through
but nothing else you say is true
so i don't believe you
i don't believe you
you may set your charm on stun
and say i'm delightful and fun
but you say that to everyone
well , i don't believe you
i don't believe you
so you're brilliant gorgeous and
ampersand after ampersand
you think i just don't understand
but i don't believe you
i don't believe you
i don't believe you
i don't believe you
