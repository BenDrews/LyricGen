i swear to god that god don't exist
i step back and twist
to sock both my fists
so pissed at people talkin' that shit
i weeble - wobble then dip my clip tip in a hot ho's abyss
now shit , that's the way to set it off : say somethin' gross
fuck it , after this i'm gonna blade - bump my throat
i'm through with the pop , two clips and a pretzel
sfr , vcr crew , shit , is it special ?
who knows ; the industry's too shifty and stressful
blah ! even eminem's new shit is successful
the action is corny , mac'll transform to thor
that is too boring , so i'm grabbin' a .44 , now
hop at a cabin and i'm clappin' a smorgasbord
in talents , i'm the most radical act in the storyboard
god - fuckin' - dammit , i don't understand it
i put a couple bandages upon a critic if he wants to pan it
the kansas city bandit answers with another schizophrenic ramblin'
so panoramic that i stun the planet
i run the gamut. you're fruity like a cup of lambic
corny like '09 rappers claimin' another planet
here come a sideways verse :
my fuckin' wife has an ass in her cock on the driveway , kurt
it's mr. cheap - joke diggler , deep - throat the artillery
angel - god alien , free - floatin' hostility
language : tongue is like midwest obesity
frustrateologist , impress so easily
illiterate like meatheads in bars
they love alliteration , think me just bizarre
my reflex'll reach up and reject re - tards
when i relapse i repackage reactions
retract , i'll seek action , relax and respect the bars
i'm marvelous ; i'll leave a large c - section scar
on your two ; not two , i mean two
achoo at you
i do a ludicrous amount of voodoo
do do , your heart go boom - boom ?
right in your ribs , right in your chest
i take it that your life is a mess
tighten your bib , take a bite and digest
i'm worse than an adolf hitler speech , i mean
i'm worse than when bernie made - awww fuck it !
first off , mac lethal's a degenerate
who scrapped my beat and offends all my feminist friends
i did this track to try and get in his pants
cause if you hate - fuck a straight man , the revolution wins
i kid , i kid : mac lethal's the boss
the owner of the audience that asher roth bought
bobby darin , hackey - sack , frat - rap , cracker fraud
partial mathers , nickelback , fuck boy , moving on...
i'm pissin' vinegar from drinkin' all the sour grapes
swish it around and take a sip and tell me how it tastes
my middle finger is stiff and stuck in this rigid state
don't get it twisted though , i love just as much as i hate
still checking cocaineblunts and nahright once a day
peace to urb magazine cause they're fuckin' with me
now run and get a mixtape , industry a pit of snakes
hip hop figure - skates , li'l wayne cripple drake
jimmy from degrassi on that slippery stage
that's some tonya harding , sweep the leg , johnny
anyway , i'm really happy for you kanye
and i'mma let you finish respondin' to jay for d.o.a
by tarnishin' his image
b. is for burnin' bridges , opposite of politickin'
and we here just talkin' shit but see me if you got a problem with
they probably in your city tryin' to start a mosh pit
if not : p.o. box 2509 , providence
if you sendin' cookies , i prefer the chocolate chip
if you're sendin' in a demo , do your thing , come correct
best spell - check them death threats before you press send
next chapter : 2010 , strange famous , tell a friend
i'm never payin' for no floor ever again
yeah right , get real , kansas city know the deal
black clover , mac / dolan i'mma go in for the kill
i'm thinkin' folks owe me props for the crow on the riddle still
not trippin' or feelin' salty , won't choke on the bitter pill
i'm focused. i'm drinking coffee. do laundry
pay the bills , then tour to display the skills
give glory to sage and build
he gave me the stage to fill
reporting on corporate criminals altered the way i feel
i'm skeptical of the president and so - called reform bills
reminiscent of rappers makin' threats and still breathin'
sorry , but 50 cent isn't change i can believe in
nothin' but and aig thing , baby
lobbyists and congress got obama seemin' shady
glenn beck got rednecks buyin' up guns
so please support the record so we can afford some
( strange famous ! )
before the civil war comes
