i went to the mountains
fell in love with the peace
but no matter how hard i try
i just can’t get no sleep
yeah , yeah sway has arrived
keeping you up through the day and the night
some wanna be ballers , some wanna be g's
saturday night fever , we’re staying alive
it’s the day in the life , roaming the streets
hands in the air if you know you’re a ( beast )
let them phone the police , we never hide
divisions but we never came here to fight
better press to top 5 there ain't no , ain't no challenge
( i just can’t get no sleep )
we practise and train in a place where there ain't no cameras
( i just can’t get no sleep )
you better get ready like a sub when the bass goes bang
( i just can’t get no sleep )
we climb up tables and we don’t even take no ladders , they’ll be looking like where’s your table manners ?
let's go
i went to the mountains
fell in love with the peace
but no matter how hard i try
i just can’t get no sleep
i said i just can’t get no sleep
i said i just can’t get no sleep
i said i just can’t get no
just can’t get no
just can’t get no sleep
( haha , yeah it's your boy ksiolajidebt )
( let's do this ! )
k - s - i yes , i’m an all nighters i don’t like rest
nothing on me at my best
selena gomez you’ve got nice ( next )
24/7 i aim for the heavens , even when i was eleven
heaven was finding the seven , minutes alone in my bedroom
aaaaarrrggghhh
hear that sound , heartbeat beating
going so fast you can see that i'm beasting
no sleep , no sleep , no sleep
you won't see any cause i ate my sheep
let's get messy like lionel
get hyper as a mosh this pit
i’m on this b@*^%
no one can stop me
out of my way let me finish this properly
deep breath , here goes , it’s super swah
on top of the mountain , no it never gets lonely when you’re going for the cup
and getting them round in with the whole team , no stopping until we’re holding a trophy
( woah , woah , woah sway mate , sway mate , you've got to go a bit more slowly )
alright tubes , you show me , but you got one bar and one bar only
sum those up on the way to the top
( oh my gosh sway , wait for the drop , drop , drop , drop )
i said i just can't get no sleep
i said i just can't get no sleep
i said i just can't get no
just can't get no
just can't get no sleep
