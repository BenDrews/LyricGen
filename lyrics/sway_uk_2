we level up , we level up
yea , we level up
hey stranger , where you been ?
long time no see
this is the remix , we goin' in
another round on me
yea , we level up
we gonna climb up the levels , go harder
lights flash every time we go past
i'll never lose the game , i'm gonna last
so let's start , we level up
look at what we started
flow so retarded
face paintin' mona lisas , told you i'm an artist
they don't even card us
they don't even look twice , i don't even look nice
what are you wearing , northface ?
just to make a statement nobody sayin' we made it
i braided my hair , niggas will say that they care
niggas will say they won't stop
niggas are sleepin' a lot
drive make for all the dollar signs , believe it or not
um , yea sway , we got 'em , we over nine thousand
we all leveled up like we just beat bowser
bino do the verses , somebody gon' need a s√©ance
your boy is crayola , give me a track to go cray on
okay , okay , let's have some silence
kids , time for a word from sway
me and the scientist were in the lab makin' the earth quake
and i heard this phrase that had me workin' hard
even on a church day ( we level up )
gotta thank god for my gift of word , pray
took that banana off rappers' matters
now i'm gettin' recognized in manors from madison square to matter park
sorry , i coughed up from that same manner that ben drew
flew across the continent with donald , yea i had to duck
get the picture ?
my instagram is instant so the whole wide world could see
who is the man in england and the bass line's ill
feel the symptoms , them other rappers is shelbyville
we are still the simpsons , i bought a two mil house
so i could end up with two lisas and i'll be seein' double
we are the biggest two features on the international come up
get - get - get your thumb up
gotta give a hand to glover it's that remix
level up
