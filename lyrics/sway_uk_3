lights flash every time we go past
i'll never lose the game , i'm gonna last
so let's start , we level up
all over the radio and back up in the raves again
we got the crowd on the wave like it's a stadium
call me the weather man it's about to be a great weekend
i'm on the cloud , let's make it rain again

nice but naughty shirts and dresses looking saucy
living in our minuses , cause life begins at 40 level up

how i maintain , i tell them winner stays on
my brain racing like i'm trying to win the gold for britain , yes !

reunion , old school and uni friends
it's your excuse to act like hooligans
bend and break the rules again
parties just getting started at 2 am
waking up at noon next to
who are you again ?
looking in the mirror and i feel like i'm famous
i got that glimmer in my eye like i ain't afraid of danger
today could be the day that everything changes
i'm trying to move up to the hills where idols become neighbors
one moment , your whole world rearranges
you feeling like you graduating oxford or cambridge
forever roll the dice and have it looking like vegas
you win some , you lose some , but only winners take risks
i start gettin' calls i've been waiting on for ages
phone starts popping and i'm gossiping with strangers
and i know... i'm out getting wasted
all of these flashing lights popping up in places
always forgetting names , especially with ladies
aha ? what's your name again ?
my house , lights out
wake up in a tee saying 'touch me i'm famous'
hey stranger , where you been ? long time no see
time to level up
i'm in the game , play to win
another round on me

we gonna climb up the levels , go harder
like splash every time we go past
i'll never loose the game , i'm gonna last
so let's start , we level up
