walk right , walk right in
walk right , walk right in
walk right , walk right in
walk right , walk right in
walk into the sunset , tell me if you wanna go
speedin' , speedin’
ain't no slowing down
tell me if you wanna roll
speedin’ , speedin’
i was telling everybody up your speed
that was a couple of years ago
and now i’m revving up for deliverance
switching up gears , got a couple of years to go
( super swah ! )
here we go ! as soon as you hear that , go
liverpool to portsmouth , yeah
that chorus got the crowd screaming
ooooh oh , ooooh oh !
ooooh oh , ooooh oh !
i got the people screaming
ooooh oh , ooooh oh !
ooooh oh , ooooh oh !
( still speedin’ )
click , click , hear the strap
seat belt derek’s back !
time to blow like i’m dynamo
no more disappearing act
i know you miss me , i miss you too
sometimes that’s what a mist will do
like taio i was cruising
now it’s time to take my steering back
one of the best to ever do it
( they say ! )
a testament to this game
( they say ! )
and even in the wind i never blew it
( they say ! )
i swayed but kept in my lane
they call me fleetwood mac
i’m a mack with a fleet
still getting royalties
no spoiler but i spoil me !
i got the crowd screaming
with a gas tank full of tear drops
collected over the years , what i use to fuel this here drop
i’m so high , everytime i drive my ears pop
clutch full of victory , never let it slip through my gearbox
now convert that drop into a rise
look into my headlights , might go blind looking in my eyes
lu is lewis ; hamilton channeling up on this track
if you ever lost it or ever feel exhausted
there’s always one formula to bring it back !
( vrrooomm... )
sway and ‘pe , go together like a and k
4 and 7 , trigger , finger
put it in the air and make it spray ( wrraaahhh ! ! ! )
kick it like a hotspur get it , tottenham’s ashes
not about cricket , strapped , we bash their brains in
pedal to the metal on a level i ain’t gonna settle
for anything less than gold
i ain’t gonna meddle around about
end up down and out
tryna build since i was little kid , i never had the lego
running through the fields and the meadows of ally pally
and now i’m a hill with geppetto
was enough to make a fake boy real !
i can definitely make a real boy hard as steel !
i ain’t gonna stop until i do a couple of million
i gave them my demo , now it’s time to deal again !
i’m back up on the bill again
i’m fresh from the bank
bob’s your uncle
mines uncle phil again
because i’ve got the will power and the potential
and i got the credentials
all of the essentials when it gets stressful
my bp rises but i’m never gonna stop
unless i need to get petrol
( swah ! )
still speeding’ !
