( chorus : trigger da author )
i went to the mountains
fell in love with the peace
but no matter how hard i try
i just can’t get no sleep
( verse1 : sway )
yeah , yeah sway has arrived
keeping you up through the day and the night
some wanna be ballers , some wanna bee gee’s
saturday night fever we’re staying alive
it’s the day in the life , roaming the streets
hands in the air if you know you’re a ( beast )
let them phone the police , we never hide
divisions but we never came here to fight
better press to top 5 there ain't no ain’t no challenge
( i just can’t get no sleep )
we practise and train in a place where there ain't no cameras
( i just can’t get no sleep )
you better get ready like a sub when the bass goes bang
( i just can’t get no sleep )
we climb up tables and we don’t even take no ladders , they’ll be looking like where’s your table manners
lets go
i went to the mountains
fell in love with the peace
but no matter how hard i try
i just can’t get no sleep
i said i just can’t get no sleep
i said i just can’t get no sleep
i said i just can’t get no
just can’t get no
just can’t get no sleep
k - s - i yes , i’m an all nighter , i don’t like rest
nothing on me at my best
selena gomez you’ve got nice ( next )
24/7 i aim for the heavens , even when i was 11
heaven was found in the 7 , minutes alone in my bedroom
aaaaarrrggghhh
hear that sound , heartbeat beating
going so fast you can see that i’m beasting
no sleep , no sleep , no sleep
you won't see any cause i ate my sheep
lets get messy like lionel
get hyper as i mosh this pit
i’m on this b@*^%
no one can stop me
out of my way let me finish this properly
i went to the mountains
fell in love with the peace
but no matter how hard i try
i just can’t get no sleep
i said i just can’t get no sleep
i said i just can’t get no sleep
i said i just can’t get no
just can’t get no
just can’t get no sleep
deep breath , here goes , it’s super swah
on top of the mountain , no it never gets lonely when you’re going for the cup
and getting them round in with the whole team , no stopping until we’re holding a trophy , we’re bringing it home in 1 4 its all for one and we ain't getting no zzzzzz
delivering goals from pillar to post , the winner is in the envelope better raise the heat and give ‘em a toast , see the steam or is it smoke ? pick a team but there’s not a lot of teams coming close
light up arenas so bright like casino’s so high up its feeling like flights up to venus
so high up its feeling like i’m on some helium
follow me , follow me follow the leaders
back on my pitch now i’m back on my mission you only get one shot i’m back in position
and i’m ready to take it , and smash i ain't missing , got the full concentration stand back and just listen
i said i just can’t get no sleep
i said i just can’t get no sleep
i said i just can’t get no
just can’t get no
just can’t get no sleep
