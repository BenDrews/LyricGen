" what'd you do last night ? "
" we did , umm , two whole cars
it was me , dez , and mean three , right ?
and on the first car in small letters it said
'all you see is…' and then you know
big , big , you know some block silver letters
that said 'crime in the city' , right ? "
" it just took up the whole car ? "
" yeah , yeah , it was a whole car and shit... "
¡escúchela ! la ciudad respirando
the new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
shining , like , " who on top of this ? "
people was tusslin' , arguing and bustlin'
gangstas of gotham hardcore hustlin'
i'm wrestling with words and ideas
my ears is pricked , seeking what will transmit
the scribes can apply to transcript
yo , this ain't no time where the usual is suitable
tonight alive , let's describe the inscrutable
the indisputable , we new york the narcotic
draped in metal and fiber optics
where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips
for profits , thirsty criminals take pockets
hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches
skyscrapers is colossus , the cost of living is preposterous
stay alive , you play or die , no options
no batman and robin
can't tell between the cops and the robbers
they both partners , they all heartless with no conscience
back streets stay darkened
where unbeliever hearts stay hardened
my eagle talons stay sharpened , like city lights stay throbbing
you either make a way or stay sobbin'
the shiny apple is bruised but sweet
and if you choose to eat , you could lose your teeth
many crews retreat , nightly news repeat
who got shot down and locked down
spotlight to savages , nasdaq averages
my narrative rose to explain this existence
amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance
so much on my mind that i can't recline
blastin' holes in the night 'til she bled sunshine
breathe in , inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
breathe out , weed smoke retrace the skyline
heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
i can't take it , y'all , i can feel the city breathing
chest heaving , against the flesh of the evening
sigh before we die like the last train leaving
breathin' in deep city breaths , sittin' on shitty steps
we stoop to new lows , hell froze the night the city slept
the beast crept through concrete jungles
communicating with one another
and ghetto birds where waters fall
from the hydrants to the gutters
the beast walk the beats , but the beats we be makin'
you on the wrong side of the track , looking visibly shaken
taken them plungers
plunging to death that's painted by the numbers
with krylon applied pressure ; cats is playing god
but having children by a lesser baby mother , but fuck it
we played against each other like puppets
swearing you got pull
when the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
getting knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise
look in the skies for god , what you see besides the smog
is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene
thoughts that people put in the air
places where you could get murdered over a glare
but everything is fair ; it's a paradox we call reality
so keepin' it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality
killers born naturally , like mickey and mallory
not knowing the ways'll get you capped , like an nba salary
some cats be emceein' to illustrate what we be seein'
hard to be a spiritual being
when shit is shaking what you believe in
for trees to grow in brooklyn , seeds need to be planted
i'm asking if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded
my blood pressure boiled and rose
‘cause new york niggas acting spoiled at shows
to the winners , the spoils go
i take the l , transfer to the 2 , head to the gates
new york life type trife , the roman empire state
so much on my mind , i just can't recline
blastin' holes in the night 'til she bled sunshine
breathe in , inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
breathe out , green smoke retrace the skyline
yo , don't the bass ride out like an ancient mating call ?
i can't take it , y'all , i can feel the city breathing
chest heaving , against the flesh of the evening
sigh before we die like the last train leaving
on the amen corner i stood lookin' at my former hood
felt the spirit in the wind
knew my friend was gone for good
threw dirt on the casket , the hurt , i couldn't mask it
mixin' down emotions , struggle i hadn't mastered
i choreograph seven steps to heaven
in hell , waiting to exhale and make the bread leaven
veteran of a cold war ; it's chica - i - go for
what i know or what's known
so some days i take the bus home , just to touch home
from the crib i spend months gone
sat by the window with a clutched dome
listening to shorties cuss long
young girls with weak minds , but they butt strong
tried to call , or at least beep the lord
but didn't have a touch - tone
it's a dog - eat - dog world , you gotta mush on
some of this land i must own
outta the city , they want us gone
tearing down the 'jects creating plush homes
my circumstance is between cabrini and love jones
surrounded by hate , yet i love home
ask my guy how he thought travelling the world sound
found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown
it's deep , i heard the city breathe in its sleep
of reality i touch , but for me it's hard to keep
deep , i heard my man breathe in his sleep
of reality i touch , but for me it's hard to keep
so much on my mind , i just can't recline
blastin' holes in the night 'til she bled sunshine
breathe in , inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
breathe out , weed smoke retrace the skyline
yo , how the bass ride out like an ancient mating call ?
i can't take it , y'all , i can feel the city breathing
chest heaving , against the flesh of the evening
kiss the odds goodbye , i’m on the last train leaving
