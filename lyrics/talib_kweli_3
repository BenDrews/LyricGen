i rise as day breaks
clouds hide the sun’s rays
quick sand and mistakes
smash walls to get through
i fight the good fight
even on the bad days
it’s darkest before light
i’m gonna push through
turbo charged bars
slot cars on tracks , falling off , game scars in these rap wars
ain’t nothing band - aids won’t cover
touring with 7d coverage
live bands , two buses , my own cash
no budget , no major label fundings , jets baby
we went from crawling to walking to running
you can’t say nothing , you under gag order
hopping out of audi’s hurting y’all with kicks , i’m the transporter
think about it , never mind , you ain’t gotta
i’m already on some whole other , word to yo mufuckin self
nobody else gon’ do it for ya , nobody else
every now and then someone’ll offer ya help , but they ain’t doing nothing
‘til they really see you tryna do something , i ain’t bluffing
kush puffing on you jive turkeys
stuffing stockings with these gifts
audible applaudables homie take a wiff
when you a man , action is what’s expected , nothing is spoken on
producer never got time for no excuses , gotta go beyond
my flow is tom - foolery
i smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
i beautifully exude the vibe that’s free of ambiguity
ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
it’s coonery , it’s lunacy , let’s make it plain
only way that you hang is attached to a tree
the moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
she makes it rain
when i’m on fire , she always try to douse me
only reason that you make it rain is ‘cause your diamonds cloudy
i see you from a mile away when it get overcast
old people feel it in they bones , invade your home like i broke the glass
and let myself in , fighting for freedom like the people in tunisia
spread through sudan and egypt , this the music for the movement
the score to your achievements , never join ‘em so you gotta beat ‘em
it’s carpe diem hey ( hey ) yeah
like kindergarteners
my vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
the starving’ll speed on ya , stampede on ya
impede on your pockets then pee on ya
dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
spending , established , with women dining and laughing
but this environment got us violent , ready to crash in -
to society , take this driver seat , hope you fastened
your seatbelts twice , when i rolled them dice , i crapped
so many times i can build casinos from scratch
too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve , relax
that’s what my mental say , but my physical’s been detached
i’m on some other shit , like fuck the government
i'm higher rankings , where’s the mothership ?
i made a covenant that i was changing by my luck has been
quite disgusting when reality tames you , where the fuck you been ?
left him face down like he was planking
in a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
you can bench curl your tribulations , that sensation's insulting
got a wifey or a mistress , nigga which one you indulging ?
regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga
i'm focused
