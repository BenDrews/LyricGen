at the bank i felt like i was in super mario world. i pointed at things that made me feel that way and i pointed at the ceiling and we went to a furniture store. we sat there. and we went to a bookstore.
you said you wanted to read ‘against love.’ i said lorrie moore had a character with a like - life instead of a love - life and you said that was good. ‘lorrie moore is good , ’ i said.
a little girl ran by with about fifteen books and you said she was a genius.
we read a children’s book that told children to eat hot dogs. and we hid it. and you pointed at infinite jest. i said my girlfriend read it and you got quiet. you were quiet and asked why i didn’t live with my girlfriend. ‘i don’t have a girlfriend , ’ i said. ‘you just said you did , ’ you said. i said i meant ex - girlfriend and a barnes and noble person stood above us.
the barnes and noble lady wore a kimono. she freaked out and gave a lecture about where to sit and we paid attention and she ran away. i looked at your face. i said something and you laughed.
you snorted when you laughed and i said that you snorted. you were louder and happier than before. i slapped you a little. i said i was wearing kimonos to work from now on. i brought you the punk planet with my story in it.
‘is it real ? ’ you said. ‘you said everything you write is real.’
i said i didn’t know and i said maybe. ‘just read it , ’ i said. ‘just read it later , ’ i said.
you read it and i looked at the side of your face. the story had my ex - girlfriend and a guitar and you asked me if i played guitar. i said , ‘i don’t know.’ i said i played drums. you said you were twenty - six and made minimum wage at barnes and noble and wore kimonos to work. and we used escalators to get to the first floor.
and we made it. i said i was going to pants you. and when we got outside it was nighttime.
