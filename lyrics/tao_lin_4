i’m going to look at madison , wisconsin through a telescope then move there
five - million - dollar poems are going to come from my head if i move from new york to wisconsin
each word i type further alienates me from other human beings
i am willing to interpret an alien crash - landing a ufo in wisconsin as a ‘desperate cry for help’
i just feel alienated from the noises that are coming out of your head
i’m going to look at other human beings through a telescope then make a desperate noise
five million dollars wouldn’t really further alienate me from my poetry
i’m going to stare at my poetry then move my desperate noise there
‘good idea , ’ i just typed
i feel that i just further alienated myself from my own desperate poem
human beings who interpret my poetry as a ‘cry for help’ further alienate me generally
i feel alienated from the noises that just came out of my cell phone
i’m going to look at you through a telescope then move there for help
from outer space madison , wisconsin looks and feels like a ‘desperately good idea’
i feel that helping an alien crash - land a five - million - dollar ufo is a really desperate thing to do
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
i feel that my poetry is fucking stupid
