i'm tired
i'm going to eat a lettuce
it's stupid to make sense
i don't want to make sense anymore
just let me type something stupid and let it be good
i'm tired
i'm stupid
i don't care
sentences are too long
go away
i'm depressed
come back
i'm having a contest for feeling tired
why am i having a contest
i want to win
or i'll kill everyone
murder isn't bad
i feel stupid
i want to emanate murder
people will die
and i'll feel good
i'm not trying to be cute
it's too hard to smile
i'm tired
i want some lettuce
go away
i'm depressed
we should do something
pleasure is stupid
let me kill you
whatever i'm about to think will be stupid
and make me tired
a cow without wings flying in the sky
is stupid and makes me unhappy
happiness is stupid
there isn't enough shit on my face
come back and shit on my face again
i'm tired
of figurative language
i don't understand
figures of speech
a piece of shit lettuce
i just typed something stupid
i want me to go away
i can't stop being stupid
grammar is stupid
i'm going to kill grammar and symbolism
thinking is stupid
i'll kill thinking
if i had a gun
i could do things
laws are stupid
i hate you
what's in front of my face
come back
i'm depressed
murder isn't bad
i'm tired
words
stupid
words are stupid
iâ€™m depressed
fuck
shit
fuck
shit
shit
shit
lettuce
shit
fucked
i am fucked
don't tell me i'm not fucked
look at this poem
i am embarrassed
at how fucked i am
i'll kill you
shitface
cowface
motherfucker
i'll kill you
murder
screaming head
screaming cowhead unattached to body
screaming
killing
shithead
i'm tired
piece of shit
masterpiece
shit
pulitzer prize
fuckhead
