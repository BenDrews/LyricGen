from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. i ate things and listened to music
someone else was feeling careful and it was making me careful
remember when i burned down someone’s house ? —i was eight
someone was dreaming of careful sizes and it was making me eight
from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. i stared at my poetry—it was making me burn
the hamster was making me laugh—i was eight
someone else was eight and it was making me stare
suddenly the peanut butter was making me sad—i was hungry ?
from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. i listened carefully to someone else’s house
i woke up staring
carefully i moved to 9 p.m.
someone’s dream was in my poetry and it was making me careful
already i was eating things
peanut things ?
