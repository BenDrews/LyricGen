sen kalk , bir minik mikrofonunu getir
bak jak burada , diktafonuna tak
kağıt , kalem bir de ilham alınacak
tam gaz choppers , havada düşman avına çıkalım
akalım , haydi bu battle'ı kazanalım
we started in the midwest
now we 'bout to take it all over the world , baby
this is the pinnacle , yeah , tech n9ne
follow me all around the planet
i run the gamut on sickology
they could never manage , we do damage with no apology
pick 'em off the panic , a little manic , ‘cause i gotta be
frantic , i’ma jam it , ‘cause i'm an oddity
gobble the track up like i'm grubbin' at mama nakas
i can pop at you proper
‘cause i’m partners with waka flocka
give me the top of hip - hop
and watch him make 'em rock with a show - stopper
chakras popping off the ( worldwide choppers )
if you anybody , you notice it
tech is the pinnacle , not an identical soul is it
loaded , cold as the polar get
wrote it quick and they quoted it
yo , it exploded , the flow , behold it , ‘cause when the motor spit
a - bi - de - a , bi - de - a , never to get free of the real
better get just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels
give me the knock and i’ma chop
he came and he went tomorrow
but i’ma lock it down and hop in the pocket , like empanadas
hit 'em up and get 'em up
i ain't done , i ain't did enough
trip when i rip it up , i be the ish when i split 'em up
sort of like i was liquored up and backing up in the gut
everybody be knowing i be acting up when i bust
from missouri to canada , i be keeping the stamina
if you never been a fan of the man
the planet's unanimous
can i cuss ? fuck anybody ! tech is calamitous
leave them in the dust
ain't nobody tough when i'm standing up
tech is hostile , he's awful
he really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
you with it , you dig it , you never lost the apostle
he's thinking he give it the poe and toss in picasso
killing everybody off is the motto
and i be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel
you said it's pathetic , my head is off in the taco
i sped and you bled and you in the coffin when i go
i'm light years ahead of my peers
want some , you can come bring it right here
can't clown me , don't come 'round me
bow down , i was crowned when they found me
check it , i'm ahead of 'em
chop it up with the veterans
a legend developin'
ain't gotta tell him it's evident
gotta notice an elephant
none of you niggas relevant
you're delicate , but loving every second of this
de vil alle tjekke når vi ligger det
kommer ind og smækker det , beatet jeg vækker det
i ved hvad der kommer ud af min mund
hanger med de vildeste gutter
det minder mig om vi stikker det af
for de kalder mig alle " vild fucking chopper "
what if i ran into you with a pogo stick
hopped up on top of you rappers like a jehovah's witness
with a photo of jesus and a paper pamphlet
and i threw up more churches , like i was playing hamlet
syllable burning , that internal damage
swing , batter , batter , but then i lay back on a hammock
under an oak tree , like i was peeling pecans
but instead , i'm peeling rappers' heads , making a sand - a - wich
pick up a .22 and put a bullet inside of a
motherfucka from inside a 1987 box
i'm headed up , yeah , headed for bucks
fuck 'em all , make them feel my dread
like i had a head of locks
feel every bump like you had bad shocks
but i hopped on the fucking beat and i worldwide chopped
wanna fuck with tech n9ne ? twist up the pine
and smoke a beat with mr. busta rhymes
well , sure , why not ?
really don't need to show any more of my cock
but i run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
in a trench coat with the pencil and a watch
then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
slumerican is out of control
heat it up , beat it up , then i gotta go
but i'm a dump truck , just send another load
peter piper dump a pile of peppers in your throats
with an alien probe
i'm light years ahead of my peers
want some , you can come bring it right here
can't clown me , don't come 'round me
bow down , i was crowned when they found me
like i gotta focus up in my rhythm or loosen the venom
and hit 'em and give 'em astig - a - ma - tism
and then i'ma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance
that everybody'll wanna devour the pieces of my enemies ‘cause of cannibalism
breaking them off into particles , they get in a predicament
that be never reversible ‘cause a nigga be too versatile
makin' you nervous
you could never compete with the colonel
i burn you , i'm an immortal , and that's the reason i murder you
focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
after i wreck and check ya , then your respect i better have
because i'm an anomaly , then i'ma give a lobotomy
to any motherfucker challenging my astronomy
hopping , i don’t stop with the fire when the flames thrown
i'm one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
throwing it up in the air , takin' it there
we wwc , if you can't keep up , should've stayed home
my alien knowledge be making other astronomers'
work look as ancient as a discovery of paleontology
so play me and i'ma be shining on them haters
i'm finna be using it as energy , watch how radiant i'ma be
like a helicopter when the words fly
entire families all the way out to you girl die
if i catch you fuckin' with the most intricate lyricists
don't even try to stop us
‘cause we choppers and we worldwide , and i'm…
i'm light years ahead of my peers
want some , you can come bring it right here
can't clown me , don't come 'round me
bow down , i was crowned when they found me
see , now they ask when i'ma stop it , my dude
and when i'ma cock it and pop it
and when i'ma drop it , my dude
inevitably , it's that i'ma be the most incredible dude
to ever spit on the record and put it together , my dude
and then they ask “what in the world is you proving
wh - when you were already the best ? ”
and “what the hell is he doing ? ”
well , i'ma be choppin' and cuttin'
and breakin' and beatin' and shakin'
and fucking everything up 'til i make no further mistake and
busting everything up , like a fuckin' angry jamaican
and shutting everything up
especially the ones who be hatin'
they loving everything until i got 'em stuttering - stupid

p - p - p - please , wh - wh - wh - why you gotta t - try us ?
w - w - w - w - we already know that you be the nicest”
and now i'ma come and kill 'em
get them , hit them , and finish them
and bang 'em in the head and diminish them
and then i'll hit 'em again at a minimum
repeat it , coming to killing 'em
then he be gotta be drilling them
thinking “they gotta be feeling him”
spitting lithium , see the way a nigga be spilling them
and getting them stupid
to the point where there's no forgiving him
hoping you're listenin' and you're paying attention
and you're witnessin' the way that i be christening in the mic
and getting in the zone , i be flattening and packing in
people from the front to the back and
they got me acting a fool , i'm black and , nigga , now i’m home
i'm light years ahead of my peers
