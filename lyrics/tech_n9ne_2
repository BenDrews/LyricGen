i get to bustin' like i'm a thirty ought six
when i'm rippin' the beat up , but then i heard he got pissed
when i got at the top and they made him purty hot
'cause he knowin' that tecca nina's a dirty chopper
he’s handle , holmes , here's a handful
how in the hell he hoverin' havin' hella go ham though ?
i said to seven , " richie havens'll be the man , " so
we put it together thinkin' eminem was a gamble
guess not , 'cause he be the guest spot
kaliko said , " what we doin' ? " i said to him , " let's chop ! "
so now the people finally get three of the best locked
never be another chopper's comin' , so let's rock , nigga !
you're on , people got to wonderin' if it's a for sure song
yes , i got another killer makin' a tour strong
if you thinkin' of battlin'—you're gone !
nobody can catch him , he the speedy gonzales
the beat is a problem
and if you got your feet in your mouth
you gon' have to beat it up out of him
it's a lot of 'em , and i mean a lot of 'em
and me and nina used to follow them
i’ve got to audibly body them
this is it , man , the hitman , the ip man , karate 'em
and the fans will lift hands , we'll be dancin' out of 'em
and in kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
if i ain't makin' sense
then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
it ain’t ever been a gift for me to heat 'em
i beat 'em , i burn 'em ( then i let 'em melt )
they never heard of us , but look at 'em turnin' up
i slap the shirt off a super simpleton , making ‘em be impotent
if and when i be flippin' , niggas be feminine
i said the purpose to pimp a pen
and reverse the conditions i’m livin' in
and do bigger numbers than eminem
gotta be fast , or i'll smash on a nigga
with half the cash i'm a little sicker , quicker than you figure
( ice cold ) i make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
if you half - ass deliverin' i'ma eat your dinner
better than mine , oh no , not me , i mean other guys
i jump around , so do that mean that i'm rubberized ?
me and n9ne master , meaning we murderize
we'll bleed 'em , beat 'em 'til they be gone , feed 'em !
speedom ! ( if you wanna go with us )
speedom ! ( i'ma leave 'em in the dust )
speedom ! ( i must be the one to bust )
speedom ! ( and i'm gonna hit the clutch )

wait ! before i wreck this beat , let me just check to see
if stephanie mills left any extra refills
of ecstacy pills next to me , in the seats spilled
or she eat ‘em all with a breakfast drink
( you inspect the sink ? )
in the habit of grabbin' a mic and babblin' , i dabble in vic's
but i might just swallow my fuckin' ritalin tablet after tonight
i’m grabbin' it right from the medicine cabinet
'cause that's what it’s like , and attackin' it like a dracula bite
jetpack in a backpack when i write
all this anger pent - up inside
i went up inside a bennigans diner with a cigarette lighter
figured i'd try to set a big enough fire
that’ll trigger the sprinkler system
and i’d escape , but the getaway driver
screwed up my limo , collided with the center divider
i went through the window
and ended up being pinned to the side
of a semi fender beside a friend of the guy’s wife brenda
the flight attendant from idaho
that took an antenna in the vagina hole
'cause when i pick up a pen i'm venomous
and i'm as slick as dennis the menace
like an evil dental hygienist , sinister
you've been yellin' dementedness
i invented this , i'm the genesis
eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
fuckin' smart alec degenerate
i got ellen degeneres tryna tell me these men are just
full of jealousy , envious of female independence
hell with a clitoris , hit or miss
you will never consider this a bitter disappointment
i'll never fail to deliver this
whatever the weather in this'll be
just like a certificate of authenticity that i'm thinkin' about
just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way
to make 'em picket , i pick a day to be a prick
then i'm pickin' the wickedest shit to say
spit it back on a level , incredible
head full of red bull , unforgettable
better believe these beats are edible
i consider loose leaf a vegetable
and i stalk my prey
you think you got away ? uh - uh , not today
murder you on a song , and then i'll just say
i was with dr. dre and robert blake , eatin' lobster , steak
and coffee cake at a restaurant with drake
and tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
i'm a lot to take , like kanye walkin' up on the stage
for beyoncé , like it's my job to say
that you're not a real artist , but it's my obligation
honest abe is on his way , you will not escape
ammunition replenished , the punisher
with his gun insured , hundred words
and a clip , in other words motherfuckers better run
if you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
no wonder no one don't wanna go
and jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the…
speedom ! ( if you wanna go with us )

i'm the fury , the final fight
i flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
i flick it on fire , finish him when the flow in flight
feminine fakers fall , i'm floggin' a foe with a fife
never forget it , i severed the head of a critic
i sped up and did it , you trippin' to be a dead epidemic
or wet up a clinic , and make a bloody redder percentage
of an addict who’s havin' to get the lead of a cynic
i was never the devil , i put up a fight up in the industry
peddle the metal , we givin' the light , a lot of energy
we reppin' , beat checkin' he that be koba
if he's the evil enemy it'll be over
wanna get down , in front of your town
you ever makin' fun of the clown , i'm gunnin' you down
we doin' it under the ground , a wonderful sound
if anybody come at the hound , no one'll be found , bitch !
would never be choppin' without slick rick
i got it from the record " lick the balls " and this dick
if you never listen to me , you musical misfit
nah , 'cause every time i be droppin' i get bit
i'm hearin' a lot of rappers , they tryin' to spit quick
but the middle west got 'em , and we kill 'em in this bitch
if you ain't in my circle of choppers , you missed it
'cause me and my nigga twista rule it , and this it
