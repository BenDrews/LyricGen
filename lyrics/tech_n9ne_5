together we are , a powerful force , as one , mind , body and soul
let no evil enter nor attempt to reduce us because of the beliefs we hold
and with this love , combined with our strength , we ward off pain and stress
technician i am , whole heartidely , in life and in death
okay i get it , i'm an f.o.n freak of nature
but the pen is gonna heat the paper
was a problem in a incubator
mom and dad was a creature maker
i never need the shaker
the beef from table , the teacher later
now you're the beast awakener
i don't think the streets are safer
my misery seepin' through my delivery
bitter we givers and they keep my figures , don't try to nigga me
the grave digger is hither , he is no kidder , see
consider the dark energy , sinner be inner me
black diamonds all around callin' all the down definites
who saw the clown and now steppin' with that tall amount of big tech and shit
aah - ooh - 3 times
my people they know what that defines
what the people are lovin' , and that's t - 9
he rhyme and make 'em make a beeline
they 'bout to hate , make out the great
they 'bout to break if they don't pay off the cake
stay out my face , you don't want me to lay out the fake
flip the sick and pray thou relate
damned and incredible straight out the gate
we are the darkness , but we’re leaving
we are the gods that are deceiving
we are the painters of blind - faith
we are the children of your rivals
holding guns while reading bibles
go ahead and seal your fate
straight out the gate
you see the face of ebah on tech nina
evil brain , angel heart i remain in the dark and anointed
with holy they console me when they know we
sin got a hold of me , why they let go of me ? i’m double jointed
i’m wicked and i represent the sickness
all you fraudulents feeling i’m falling offending the father
i place you in the deepest darkest part of abyss
nobody but you and without any food and no agua
i blackened the sun on you bitches
sat in the dungeons and ditches
yappin is one of your glitches - halt it
the kraken has come with the quickness
back and i’m plundering chicks
and laughing you dummies trip with exalted
tech n9ne
fuck the industry , independents , we enemies to them and he that’s blind
the champ is here , the vamp is near
huntin' you heathens , hella hungry and i’m amped this year
i am the public enemy #1
fuck your fame , i became the name of a gun
now they parents hate aaron because they sons
and daughters wanna be martyrs believing in my art , ain't it young ?
all i got is my balls and rap ,
i'm appalled that y'all want me to fall calling craps
suckers hate it , now they crawlin' back cause i'm tall as shaq
and i'm always up for brawlin' bats
strange music saved my life
i was fuckin' it then the music became my wife
nobody on this planet can tame my mic
call me crazy , don't matter , fucking insane i like
when the sun's beam melts
everyone screams help
then only one king's felt
when telling all survivors welcome to something else
and i say kansas city
will always stay kansas city
yeah
this is something else baby !
lets go !
i ain't knockin no more i'm breakin' in
