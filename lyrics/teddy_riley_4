now what do you keep calling for
( its over )
in the back of my mind i question why i keep calling
i guess im just used to getting my way im spoiled
i dont wanna be what you want me to be
so when i call you're just yelling at me
( i'm sorry it's my fault )
oooh & the clothes i brought you can still wear
did you store the cards & teddy bears
see there i go again sticking my nose
( i'm sorry it's my fault )
now what do you keep calling for
( it's over )
girl talking to myself in the mirror is strange enough
so you gotta know sharing this with you is painful
you know we used to talk about our future
( it ain't just all my fault ) ( i know , i know we used to talk
about it babe )
so say goodbye to the way the leaves would fall
the way we stand in the rain & we would ball ( we would cry )
just say goodbye to the walks & talks & the dogs in the park
( & it ain't just all my fault )
now what do you keep calling for
( it's over )
we lost a four leaf clover
dont ask why shorty be over
news flash shorty we over
we like def jam & hova
we like bobby & whitney
except without the kiddies
like pamela anderson's career
except without the tittes
we had some good times didn't we
i know i won't forget that
but we had some bad times &
that's time i wish i could get back
we could've had it all
now i just i just don't know
you been around me long enough
to know that now it's over
now what do you keep calling for
( it's over ) it's nothing we can do with it
so you might as well forget it ( it's over )
