yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah
your love for me came as a waterfall
flowing inside me like never before
your love for me , something i didn't see
but baby , i know better now
when you walked in the room that very night
a special feeling just burst inside
it was only you , nobody else
but baby , i know better now
don't wanna love you if you don't love me
don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
don't wanna tell you this now
but it wouldn't be right if i ( if i )
didn't tell you this tonight
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah
and now you're back inside my house again
i'm trying deeply to explain
'cos baby , i wanna get it on
and baby , you're the one for me ( woah , woah , woah )
and now that i have got you all alone
after all this talking on the phone
i should be strong
there's nothing wrong
i'll tell you this is where you belong ( where you belong )
don't wanna love you if you don't love me
don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
don't wanna tell you this now
but it wouldn't be right if i ( if i )
didn't tell you this tonight
don't wanna love you if you don't love me ( if you don't love me )
don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
don't wanna tell you this now
but it wouldn't be right if i ( if i )
didn't tell you this tonight
it was just something in your eyes
that made me realise
now i hear voices deep inside
telling me , telling me it's you and i
don't wanna love you if you don't love me
don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
don't wanna tell you this now
but it wouldn't be right if i ( if i )
didn't tell you this tonight
don't wanna love you if you don't love me ( if you don't love me )
don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
don't wanna tell you this now
but it wouldn't be right if i ( if i )
didn't tell you this tonight
