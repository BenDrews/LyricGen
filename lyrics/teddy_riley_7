i need an alarm system in my house
so i know when people are creepin' about
these people are freakin' me out ( these days )
it's getting hectic everywhere that i go
they won't leave me alone
there's things they all wanna know
i'm paranoid about the people i meet
why are they talkin' to me
and why can't anyone see
i just wanna live
don't really care about the things that they say
don't really care about what happens to me
i just wanna live
just wanna live
just wanna live
just wanna live
just wanna live
just wanna live
just wanna live
i rock a law suit when i'm goin' to court
a white suit when i'm gettin' divorced
the black suit at the funeral home
and my birthday suit when i'm home alone
talkiin' on the phone
got an interview with the rolling stone
they're sayin' " now you're rich and now you're famous
fake ass girls all know your name and
lifestyles of the rich and famous
your first hit , aren't you ashamed
of the life , of the life , of the life you're livin "
i just wanna live
don't really care about the things that they say
don't really care about what happens to me
i just wanna live
stop your messin' around boy
better think of your future
better make some good plans boy
said every one of my teachers
look out , you better play it safe
you never know what hard times will come your way
we say , where we're comin' from
we've already seen the worst that this life can bring
now we expect it everywhere that we go
all the things that they say
yeah we already know
i just wanna live
don't really care about the things that they say
don't really care about what happens to me

i just wanna live
( just wanna live )
( just wanna live )
( just wanna live )
i just wanna live
( just wanna live )
( just wanna live )
