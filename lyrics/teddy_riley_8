i got a distant lover
so many mile away
so far away
i want him close to me
i know the situation that you're thinking
and you were skeptical
of giving up your loving to me
under the circumstance
boy , we took a chance
i never knew good good loving would be
we made our messes
now you're gone away
and i live everyday
for the day
just to see you again
soon i will see you again
i got a distant lover
so many miles away
somehow i gotta get him closer to me
i want him close to me
reminiscing all those long summer days
summer nights
doing it right , babe
you just don't know how bad
oh , boy i want you back
doing the things that me and you used to do
we made our messes
now you're gone away
and i live everyday
for the day
just to see you again
i just wait to see my distant lover
i got a distant lover
so many miles away
oh yeah i want him close to me
i want him close to me
( oh distant lover )
you know what i'm trying to say
( waiting all night , waiting all day )
i'm keeping thoughts of you
that i can't erase
( until i see you again )
say a prayer for me please
( until i see you again )
and in the meantime keep thinking of me
