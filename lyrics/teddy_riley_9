yo dre , drop the verse
it's going down fade to blackstreet
the homies got rb collab' creations bump like acne
no doubt , i put it down , never slouch
as long as my credit could vouch
a dog couldn't catch me , ass out
tell me who could stop with dre makin' moves
attractin' honeys like a magnet
givin' them ear - gasms with my mellow accent
still movin' his flavor
with the homies blackstreet and teddy
the original rump shakers
shorty get down , good lord

each and every day , true player way
i can't get her outta my mind ( well )
i think about the girl all the time ( well well )
east side to the west side
push your fat rides , it's no surprise
she got tricks in the stash
stacking up the cash , fast when it comes to the gas
by no means average
she's on when she's got to have it

very low key on the profile
catchin' feelings is a no
let me tell you how it goes
curve's the word , spin's the verb
lovers it curves so freak what you heard , ( oooohh )
rollin' with the phatness
