at first i was scared
the way these feelings started coming on
i couldn’t breathe without you there
i couldn’t see without you in my arms
i opened up my eyes to find your eyes already open
i see a piece of me inside
as if it’s been there all the time
i am just blood , i am just bones
i am just a heart that’s beating out every second of your touch
i am just stars , i am just sky
i am falling to the rhythm of all your endless love
it keeps me up at night
was there a time i lived without you ?
just living off your air
every breath is all about you
i’m spinning all the worlds around
to try and rearrange them
i work so hard to say goodnight
but there's too much of you left behind
i am just blood , i am just bones
( you are just running through my veins )
i am just a heart ( keeping me alive ) that’s beating out ( rushing everywhere ) every ( inside of me ) second of your touch
i am just stars , i am just sky
( you are everything i see )
i am falling ( stretched ahead of me ) to the rhythm ( i’m not afraid , just let me fall ) of all your endless love
is this really ending ?
is this really ending ?
all our endless love
i am just blood , i am just bones
( you are just running through my veins )
i am just a heart ( keeping me alive ) that’s beating up ( rushing everywhere ) every ( inside of me ) second of your touch
i am just stars , i am just sky
( you are everything i see )
i am falling ( stretched ahead of me ) to the rhythm ( i’m not afraid , just let me fall ) of all your endless love
