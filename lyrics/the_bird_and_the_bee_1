touch yourself , get yourself
come alive , just driving it around

living in la , la la la la la
living in la , la la la la la
living in la , la la la la la
summer night , take off your clothes
the water's warm , our bodies glowing
light you up , stretch it out
now i know i could never live without
la , la la la la
living in la
( stop asking me where i come from )

los angeles , los angeles
don't listen to a thing they say
they don't need you in the same way
los angeles , los angeles
don't ever let them change you
they don't know you like i do
los angeles , los angeles ( x3 )
hey , you don't need their love
los angeles , los angeles ( x3 )
no , you don't need their love
touch yourself , get yourself
let yourself , come alive
put me out , pull me in
get me off , now let's begin
i'm from la , la la la la la
living in la , la la la la la
living in la , la la la la la
living in la , la la la la la
