you were so young , young and dumb
you were the baddest , the biggest , the bestest , burned out one
you filled a bill , you kept it fun
but there was always something coming up that you couldn’t outrun
you were
wrecking , the wrecking , the wrecking , wrecking ball
we always knew you’d hit the wall
wrecking , the wrecking , the wrecking , wrecking ball
we always knew you would fall down
my mother said the very next one and you are not it
my mama said the very next one and you are not it
you once were hot and we were cold
all the trash you’d leave behind would just burn into gold
you were a fire , out of control
but nothing stays that pretty when it’s oversold
you were
wrecking , the wrecking , the wrecking , wrecking ball
we always knew you’d hit the wall
wrecking , the wrecking , the wrecking , wrecking ball
we always knew you would fall down
my mother said the very next one and you are not it
my mama said the very next one and you are not it
wrecking , the wrecking , the wrecking , wrecking ball
we always knew you’d hit the wall
wrecking , the wrecking , the wrecking , wrecking ball
we always knew you would fall down
my mama said ( x4 )
my mother said the very next one and you are not it
my mama said the very next one and you are not it
