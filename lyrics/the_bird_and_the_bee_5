lost on an island with some joker who just jokes incessantly
and some singer won’t stop singing , is it her or is it
save me , save me , save me ( x3 )
from the wicked things i see
take me , take me , take me ( x3 )
to a place i’d rather be
please , will you take me ?
home
will you take me ?
i don’t even know if i’d even know the way without you now
will you take me ?
please
will you take me ?
there’s too much to say but you’ll say that i am much too tired tonight
will you take me ?
home
will you take me ?
carry me inside , like i carry you , you carry me inside
will you take me home ?
tell me how you missed me while you kiss me
i’ve been gone for much too long
going crazy , making babies keeping house and singing
fill me , fill me , fill me ( x3 )
with all the love i’d ever need
kill me , kill me , kill me ( x3 )
i would kill myself to please you
please , will you take me ?
home
will you take me ?
i don’t even know if i’d even know the way without you now
will you take me ?
please
will you take me ?
there’s too much to say but you’ll say that i am much too tired tonight
will you take me ?
home
will you take me ?
carry me inside , like i carry you , you carry me inside
will you take me home ?
