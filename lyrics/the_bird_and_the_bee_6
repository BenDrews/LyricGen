give it up for me please
put your hands in the air
if you know what's good for you
you wanna shake it like you just don't care
would you please clap your hands
and get up on your feet
i beg of you to get up and dance
it's such a crazy kick - ass beat
pardon me , the music is moving
moving from left to right
apologies , for losing my cooling
losing the day to night
since i'm asking so nice
would you just entertain ?
there's nothing left to hide you away
just show a little bit of brain
yes , that is what i mean
that's the nail that i hit
i try to be as coy as i can
but i want to see your naughty bit
would you please , would you please
would you , would you please
( apologies , apologies , apologies )
would you , would you please
would you please clap your hands
pardon me , the music is moving
moving from left to right
apologies , for losing my cooling
losing the day to night
would you be nasty with me ?
do you like dancing with me ?
i think we have a very special quality
i want to show it to you
i want to grow it with you
get horizontal with you , change my point of view
would you please , would you please
would you , would you please
( apologies , apologies , apologies )
would you , would you please
would you please clap your hands
pardon me , the music is moving
moving from left to right
apologies , for losing my cooling
losing the day to night
