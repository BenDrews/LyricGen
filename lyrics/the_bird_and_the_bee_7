oh so restless again
i don’t think i’m well
i don’t learn my lessons
oh the doctor says
there’s just nothing wrong
he said
“i’m sorry honey , but it’s all in your head”
i know that you’re right
but could you hold me tonight
doctor , doctor , doctor , doctor
give me pills , or give me love
you’re the only one who knows
how i try so hard to let it all go
doctor , doctor , doctor , doctor , doctor
kiss me now , kiss me again
you’re the only one who tries
you really look into my eyes
oh i need to come in
i have such a pain
and it starts deep within
oh the doctor says
that everything’s fine
he said
“i see that you’re hurting , but i can’t find the thread.”
i feel how you care
won’t you start this affair ?
doctor , doctor , doctor , doctor
give me pills , or give me love
you’re the only one who knows
how i try so hard to let it all go
doctor , doctor , doctor , doctor , doctor
kiss me now , kiss me again
you’re the only one who tries
you really look into my eyes
doctor , doctor , doctor , doctor
give me pills , or give me love
you’re the only one who knows
how i try so hard to let it all go
doctor , doctor , doctor , doctor , doctor
kiss me now , kiss me again
you’re the only one who tries
you really look into my eyes
