i think i know better
i don’t hit like a feather
i just feel something
i’ll put it on the line
but if you don’t know
i don’t mind
just say so
but take your time , move real slow , and let me say before you go
that we should get closer ?
we should lose our composure
act it out like someone half our age
you could kiss and tell
i don’t mind some cheap motel
let’s take our time , move real slow , but me let say just so you know
don’t you run away ( x3 )
baby we could rule this town
so please
don’t you run away ( x3 )
won’t you turn around
come on
don’t you run away ( x3 )
don’t make me run you down
no no no
don’t you run away ( x3 )
don’t you run way from me
i know i’m ambitious
but you’re so delicious
i wish every day was sadie hawkins day
coming on strong
that’s my way
i can’t be wrong
give an inch , take a mile , please don’t go , sit down a while
we could get fancy
you could dine me and dance me
but i’m telling you that’s really not my style
i’m a cheap date
no mystery
no switch , no bait
you could search whole wide world
i’m just not like any girl
don’t you run away ( x3 )
baby we could rule this town
so please
don’t you run away ( x3 )
won’t you turn around
come on
don’t you run away ( x3 )
don’t make me run you down
no no no
don’t you run away ( x3 )
don’t you run way from me
