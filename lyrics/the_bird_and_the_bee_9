my love let me go again
right back , back to the top of the slide
down , sad clown
oh , oh , oh , oh , oh
my clown , let me love you
what’s that
back to the back of the rebound
clowning around
oh , oh , oh , oh
hey boy , won't you take me out tonight ?
i’m not afraid of all the reasons why we shouldn’t try
hey boy , won't you make me out tonight ?
i get excited when i think of climbing into your eyes
oh , my legs , take me there again
up top to the top of the freefall
a great wall
oh , oh , oh , oh , oh
my mouth , let me kiss again
sift out , sift out all of the dust bowl
the black coal
oh , oh , oh , oh
hey boy , won't you take me out tonight ?
i’m not afraid of all the reasons why we shouldn’t try
hey boy , won't you make me out tonight ?
i get excited when i think of climbing into your eyes
hey boy , won't you take me out tonight ?
i’m not afraid of all the reasons why we shouldn’t try
hey boy , won't you make me out tonight ?
i get excited when i think of climbing into your arms
