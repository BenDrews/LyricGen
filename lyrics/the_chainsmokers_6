you know , i'm sorry
i won't make it to your party
got caught up in my own selfishness
it won't let me be a part of this
and i know i've started
drifting off every second
i can't wait to leave as soon as i arrive
i count the seconds
down and down we go
we'll torch this place we know
before one of us takes a chance
and breaks this , i won't be the one
no , i won't be the one
i know it's pathetic
fuck it , yeah , i said it
tried to tell it like it is
there's a chance that i'll regret it , so
let's go , let's end this
i delete before i send it
and we can play pretend
like we haven't reached the end yet
down and down we go
and we'll torch this place we know
before one of us takes a chance
and breaks this , i won't be the one
no , i won't be the one
( you know , i'm sorry )
( i'm sorry )
no , i won't be the one
no , i won't be the one
