i have never wished on hope
didn’t need a telescope to see where i am going
i have never been the one trying hard to hold my tongue
it’s my stereo and
one day i'll stand with a crown on my head
like a god , yeah , like a god
with every step , no , i won't second guess what i want
i wanna be like kanye
i'll be the king of me always
do what i want , i'll have it my way
all day , like kanye - eah , yeah , yeah
like kanye , kanye , yeah - ah , yeah - ah
like kanye , kanye , yeah - ah , yeah - ah
i'll be the king of me
born in a broken home , okay

we made out the paradise
build on nickels , rubbing dimes
i'mma turn it to so much more
one day i'll stand with a crown on my head
like a god yeah , like a god
with every step , no , i won't second guess what i want
i wanna be like kanye
