na , na , na , na , my nose runnin'
got my shades over this
the whole skyline of the city's right in front of my face , yeah
i'm in the zone this year , it's all fire nigga check my attire
your worst fear is confirmed , your reign at the top expires this year
no application , i'm hired this year
this a dedication to that bitch who slashed my nigga tires , oh yeah
i knew about you , bitch i knew about you
came up on a good nigga , he ain't have a clue about you
tried to tell that nigga , don't trust that bitch as far as you can smell her , nigga
but you live and you learn
on these road to riches niggas bound to miss a few turns
don't let the bridges that you cross turn into bridges you burn
you're bound to miss a few turns
don't let the bridges that you.. fuck it you don't hear me
look , ayo , i walk along this long harbor of life and sit on the piers
reflect on my pain and shit on my fears
should i feel an ounce of guilt that i outdid all my peers ?
or write my name in the sky and show them niggas i'm here ?
this one is for the history books , picture me shook or failin'
this is revenge of the dreamer
misery took a million of my niggas' hopes from 'em , don't even know some 'em
no more , the coke numbed 'em , no suicide notes from 'em
they killin' theyselves , slowly killin' they cells
five iphones dropped , my nigga still in the cell
he said he found god , shit , i doubt it , to each his own
whatever keeps you strong to get up out it , we need you home
cause see a war's goin' on outside , i 'bout cried
when that boy that the cops shot died , my mouth wide open from shock
sick and tired of hopin' it'll stop
this pen the only hope that i got , i open up shop , and break out
got what you want , i got what you need
my heart on my sleeve , watch me bleed , i break out !
dreamville is the team , my team iller than fiends
and ye' ain't real as you seem , and we can tell , nigga
fuck what you think , cause if your shit don't stink
nigga my shit won't sink , cause it can't , i break out !
i gotta break the fuck up outta here
dreamville is the team , my team iller than fiends
and ye' ain't real as you seem , and we can tell , nigga
war stories , got tour stories
pop four whores on the top floor stories
niggas know , every verse is worth a brick of blow
just a seven figure nigga got the game in figure four
i know at times i'm hypocritical , you niggas dig it though
i fuck until my dick be sore , leave bitches walkin' pigeon toe and break out !
on to the next bitch , homie
your new chick , that's my ex - bitch , homie , in fact i'm still logged in her netflix , homie
just make sure she cook you breakfast , homie
her bacon slimmin' but her eggs get runny , funny
so many bombs , you'd think flex get money , from me
cole world but my neck get sunny
now i don't fuck around with hoes from reality shows
or blow up dolls , cause i don't like havin' sex with dummies , love me
no disrespect meant , honey , this just a compilation of my observations
while trapped in this god - forsaken nation
shit , but since we makin' conversation
i've been thinkin' me and you would make a bangin' combination
i know that you mad , i know what i said
but my dick be arguin' with my head , are you with the bed ?
well if so let's break out !
