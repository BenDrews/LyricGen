see any angels in the city
see any angels in the city
see any angels in the city
tell them mothafuckas i'm forever paid
california king , wrestle gators in the everglades
drive up out that mothafuckin' swamp in the escalade
so before you put that red rag in your pocket
i wanna see your fuckin' résumé
started off on ground zero , then i start to levitate
rip rappers a new asshole – i never hesitate
dre beats on , smokin' that chronic just to meditate
i'ma give 'em hurricanes until another levee break
you niggas is featherweights , i'm aftermath's heavyweight
now dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
when a nigga wack found me , shit , i was sellin' weight
now a nigga's sellin' millions , now it's time to celebrate
performin' in front of millions , nigga , every race
64 in the '64 , now watch the chevy scrape
fourth album , no five mics ? then let 'em hate !
but i'm not stoppin' till i'm the fuckin' king in every state
recognize my life , ridicule my fight
give me fuel for the fire burnin' when i yearn these lights
in the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
get familiar with cartwright , ‘cause i want that shot
i'm a raging bull when the needle drops
for the record , i'ma wreck it , even if my record don't pop
i'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
let it tow behind me , tell 'em they can find me
in the dark with the ghetto children
look at my heart , nigga , fuck your feelings , this is me
i'm sick of mothafuckas talkin' about " the west died "
can't you hear my heart beatin' ? that's the motherfuckin' westside
you test me , you test god , i'm his son
it say in psalms , you come at me
then i can split you with this tommy gun
you won't have no time to run
i'm from the compton slums , and that's how the west ride
i'm from the city where two of the best died
rest in peace to both of 'em , spit like i'm the ghost of 'em
damn , i said i spit like i'm the ghost of 'em
name your top 10 , i'm harder than the most of 'em
matter of fact , shorten your list , nigga , top 5
game , biggie , hov… probably pac , nas
no particular order , bet a mill' that i slaughter
serve niggas , give a fuck what you ordered
how dare you niggas pop fly , when i'm the nigga ?
sold 5 mill' out the gate , and numbers do not lie
recognize my life , ridicule my fight
give me fuel for the fire burnin' when i yearn these lights
in the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
get familiar with cartwright , ‘cause i want that shot
i'm a raging bull when the needle drops
for the record , i'ma wreck it , even if my record don't pop
i'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
let it tow behind me , tell 'em they can find me
in the dark with the ghetto children
look at my heart , nigga , fuck your feelings , this is me
i gave you the documentary , shit was a classic
gave you doctor's advocate , you ripped it out the package
came with lax , since critics said it was average
i was stressed the fuck out , torn between aftermath and
geffen , interscope , now i got you in the scope
spill the red ink on the paper , it's like my pen is broke
and this is what you all been waitin' for
i'm the lost angel knockin' on satan's door
what the fuck y'all take me for ?
i love you ‘cause you hate me more
i'm kobe on the lakers floor , except i give you 84
shake you like haiti's floor
walk up on you , like , " what's goin' on , baby boy ? "
shots in that mercedes door
either i'm crazy or the black slim shady or
could that be the reason that baby said he would pay me more ?
but i still owe jimmy one more album
the best the west has ever seen , no disrespect to calvin
recognize my life , ridicule my fight
give me fuel for the fire burnin' when i yearn these lights
in the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
get familiar with cartwright , ‘cause i want that shot
i'm a raging bull when the needle drops
for the record , i'ma wreck it , even if my record don't pop
i'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
let it tow behind me , tell 'em they can find me
in the dark with the ghetto children
look at my heart , nigga , fuck your feelings , this is me
kendrick , and i wear pendant on my shoulder
soldier , like a lieutenant
and the coupe tinted , got pulled over
johnny always lock a nigga down , knowin' damn well
we don't wanna see the box like manny pacquiao
little nigga mayweather size
ride like pac in his prime ; thug life is now on radar
'til the federal come through and raid ours
reminiscin' when the l.a. raiders
was in my home , snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
and i don't condone dickridin'
i'm addicted to westsidin'
livin' in a city where the skinny niggas die
and the semi bullets fly , but it turned me to a lion
tryin'… and i mean that shit
game came through , put the city on his back
i was in the city with a nigga , had seen that shit
" compton ! " – a nigga gotta scream that shit
never went commercial , never tv - screened that shit
can't block or screen that shit
now everybody sing that shit !
red is a very emotionally and instense color. it enhances human metabolism , increases respiration rate , and raises blood pressure. it has a very high visibility , which is why stop signs , stop lights , and fire equipments are usually painted red. it also represents one third of california's gang population. needless to say , please dress accordingly while visiting the los angeles area. also , tuck your jewellry , and keep your hands inside your vehicle. thank you ! enjoy it !
