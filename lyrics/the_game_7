punk - ass motherfucker , checkin' shit
what you was gonna do ?
kill me in my sleep , you bitch - ass nigga ?
2pac , biggie – shut the fuck up !
fuckin' dogs , barkin' and shit
( don't shoot , don't shoot ! )
fuck you , nigga !
and i'm grindin' till i'm tired
‘cause they said : " you ain't grindin' till you tired. "
so i'm grindin' with my eyes wide
lookin' to find a way through the day , a light for the night
dear lord , you done took so many of my people
i'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
like what the hell am i doin' right ? my life
take me away from the hood , like a state penitentiary
take me away from the hood , in a casket or a bentley
take me away , like i overdosed on cocaine
or take me away , like a bullet from kurt cobain
suicide , i'm from a windy city , like do or die
from a block close to where biggie was crucified
that was brooklyn's jesus , shot for no fuckin' reason
and you wonder why kanye wears jesus pieces ?
‘cause that's jesus , people – and game , he's the equal
hated on so much , passion of christ need a sequel
yeah , like roc - a - fella needed siegel
like i needed my father , but he needed a needle
i need some meditation so i can lead my people
they askin' , " why , why did john lennon leave the beatles ? "
and why every hood nigga feed off evil ?
answer my question 'fore this bullet leave this desert eagle
and i'm grindin' till i'm tired
‘cause they said : " you ain't grindin' till you tired. "
so i'm grindin' with my eyes wide
lookin' to find a way through the day , a light for the night
dear lord , you done took so many of my people
i'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
like what the hell am i doin' right ? my life
we are not the same , i am a martian
so approach my phantom doors with caution
you see them 24's spinnin' ? i earned 'em
and i ain't no preacher , but here's my erick sermon
so eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
and fuck jesse jackson , ‘cause it ain't about race now
sometimes i think about my life , with my face down
then i see my sons and put on that kanye smile
damn , i know his mama proud ; and since you helped me sell my dream , we can share my mama now
and like m.j.b. no more drama now
livin' the good life , me and common on common ground
i spit crack , and niggas could drive it out of town
got a chris paul mindstate , i'm never out of bounds
my life used to be empty like a glock without a round
now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds
and i'm grindin' till i'm tired
‘cause they said : " you ain't grindin' till you tired. "
so i'm grindin' with my eyes wide
lookin' to find a way through the day , a light for the night
dear lord , you done took so many of my people
i'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
like what the hell am i doin' right ? my life
walk through the gates of hell , see my impala parked in front
with the high beams on , me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts
listenin' to the chronic album , playin' backwards
shootin' at pictures of don imus for target practice
my mind fucked up , so i cover it with a raider hood
i'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of suge
made my grandmother pray for good
it never made her happy , but i bet that new mercedes could
ain't no bars , but niggas can't escape the hood
and it took so many of my niggas that i should hate the hood
but it's real niggas like me that make the hood
ridin' slow in that phantom just the way i should
with the top back , in my sox hat
i'm paid in full , the nigga alpo couldn't stop that
even if they brought the nigga pac back
i'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back
and i'm grindin' till i'm tired
‘cause they said : " you ain't grindin' till you tired. "
so i'm grindin' with my eyes wide
lookin' to find a way through the day , a light for the night
dear lord , you done took so many of my people
i'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
like what the hell am i doin' right ? my life
