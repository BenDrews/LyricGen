she got on tights with the leather skin
she a rockstar , bring the heavy metal in
girl shaped like a coke bottle , medell√≠n
in love with her 'til she went and let the devil in
she pop pills like medicine
she probably gon' die , it's startin' to be evident
i told her , " slow down , girl you're heaven - sent "
i'm a thug but i got a heart like kev and them
and i can't let this girl throw her life away
kick her dorm room in and told her put the knife away
took her to the hospital like right away
she a angel with demons , the girl like night and day
stressed out , parents getting divorced
girl love 'em both , she ain't tryin' to sit in court
she a square so it's hard to see the angle
and that's why god gave her an guardian angel
it's me , and i'm here for her , swear to god that i'm here for her
last nigga got her caught up in the airport
she ain't had no prior , so she went and did a year for him
she a ride - or - die , like eve and them
make home - cooked meals every evening
start stripping on the side , now i'm tipping on the side
love life like joselin and stevie and them
am i wrong for being the best that i can to her ?
takin' her son and tryin' to be a man to him
she don't wanna pray , but i told her put her hands to it
i done came a long way from that tan buick
yeah , grandmother would be proud of me
almost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me
remember momma knockin' on the door hounding me
bought her a car and a crib even though she doubted me
( when i wake up every day ) even though she doubted me
( i thank the lord that we are safe ) even though she doubted me
( again , yeah ) even though she doubted me
( that's why you should pray for me )
that's my momma and i love her with my heart like i love you
if you strugglin' , baby daddy ain't takin' care of the kids

i'm here whenever you need me , gon' reach out , it's that easy
i love women , cause without women
wouldn't none of us niggas be breathin'
