once art was short and life was long ;
we stood before you on the stage ; marked our bonds in bars
we kept the tempo good and strong
together we were all the rage , then the wrath moved on and we were left
hell -
bent
hide -
bound
in the age of recorded sound
in the age of recorded sound
signifying everything we’d do ;
in time
then art grew longer , life less so ;
you paired off into parenthood , swearing you’d be back
with longing looks we watched you go
but somehow it was understood ; further down the track we’d meet again
all
home -
ward
bound
in the age of recorded sound
in the age of recorded sound
signifying everything we’d done ;
in time
now all our yesterdays await ;
tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow at the door
perhaps we’ve left it rather late ;
to walk among you for a while
very soon we shall be heard no more
but in the meantime
we can play
in the meantime
there’s still today
and today
there’s still today
and today
there’s still today...
there’s still today
