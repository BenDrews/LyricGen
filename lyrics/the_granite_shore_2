and it’s best if they’re left well alone
our positions marked , the hierarchy set
all the ghosts have joined us too ;
the ideas , the songs , the people who
we left behind ; have they caught us yet ?
you must still have something left to say...
the earth move and the ice caps melt
though it sometimes seemed we were held in place by twine
even then i never knew
if the rest of you could feel it too
or if the only blood that ever thrilled was mine
someone has to count us off and
you know none of us can stay
be that as it may ;
this could be our one last chance...
once more from the top
it’s cold in here and won’t get warmer...
we fought like cats and dogs...
the good we’ve done just might live on
of course we used to feel it just as you did...
the time...
be that as it may ;
you wrote our lines...
actors in your play
our little live performance...
