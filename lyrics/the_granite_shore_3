once upon a time i could’ve been a poet
but i was born into this sadly darkened age
or else i might’ve written novels for a living
painting pictures for the printed page
i have always had a nose for the money
and i know just where to look for the meat
i’ve a voice that drips with purity and honey
dark and sweet
so i would dance from here to norwich in the rain
as long as crowds came out to see me in my triumph and my pain
i’d sing for pennies as we sped across east anglia
if you’d all love me
again
as the poets had their time , as did the painters
the composers and the silent movie stars
in turn the spotlight flickered over them a moment
before it came to rest on us and our guitars
although i couldn’t ever claim to be saintly
i have kept my indiscretions fairly neat
i have paid some taxes and i’m still pretty dainty
on my feet
so i would dance from here to norwich in the rain
as long as scribes were there to chronicle my triumph and my pain
i’d sing the words you all grew up with outside ipswich
if you’d all love me
again
the men in the white coats were engineers
the fourth part of the day has been and gone
i want it more than ever it appears...
but still soldier on
so i would dance from here to norwich in the rain
we shall defy the laws of gravity and dignity and shame
if you will hold my coat i’ll go and drain the fens
if you’ll all love me again
if you’ll all love me once again
