just like every band of brothers
we held a future in our heads
we cut our cloth together
every day
you and i and all the others
slept on floors instead of beds
we went all out hell for leather as we
made our way
and in a voice so sweet and brown
you would sing each honeyed word
breathed alive as they came dripping from my pen
and as we tore the old world down
it would’ve just seemed so absurd
to try to put it back together again
then with a foot upon the ladder
we ditched a couple of the boys
you couldn’t see that they had
earned their keep
then it all got that bit madder
bigger , brighter , faster toys
the bridges that we burned were over waters
running deep
then in a voice so sweet and brown
you would sing each honeyed word
there seemed no limit to the power of my pen
and when i came to put it down
it felt so heavy and i wondered
could we put it back together again ?
although you sold us down the river
for some silver and a ribbon
for less than that you don’t get out of bed
i will defend you to the death
to my very final breath and
i won’t let them harm a hair upon your head
