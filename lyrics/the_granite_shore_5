the control room in a recording studio. rich and malcolm are seated behind a mixing desk. tony is in the vocal booth , but his voice can be heard over the studio monitors
malcolm : ok , tape's rolling
tony : what , really ? you still use tape ?
malcolm : sometimes , yeah , when we've got a bigger budget , but i was speaking figuratively
tony : where've i heard that before ?
rich : you've got no short - term memory left at all , have you ?
rich : calm down. let's just get on with tarting up this live stuff in case anyone ever wants to release it , shall we ? you kept singing the wrong words , even though the audience were singing the right ones. admittedly my bvs might've wandered off into the avant - garden from time to time as well
tony : the gig was good , wasn't it ? it seems like only last week
rich : it was last week
tony : i'm still buzzing !
rich : it's called tinnitus
malcolm : actually he's right , there's a hum somewhere , i'd better sort it out. why don't you two take a break ?
rich : not sure that's a good idea ; the last one we took went on for over thirty years. where are the others , anyway ?
malcolm : unless your rhythm section are wildly different to everyone else's , they'll be in the pub or maybe the pool room , griping about you and planning to form a band of their own
rich : how could i've forgotten ? for 'twas ever thus
rich : not quite what i was trying to convey when i wrote it , but songs eventually find their own meanings , i s'pose. let's leave him in there , shall we ? safest place
