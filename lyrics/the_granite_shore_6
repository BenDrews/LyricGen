they’ll be backstage at the ballroom and gathered all around
lining up to cheer us from the wings
with a galaxy of disco lights and a system for the sound
we shall speak of many wondrous things
in a tired red tuxedo and a pair of platform shoes
i’ll saunter on and head for centre stage
though you , my brothers , may not be the hired hands i’d choose
together we’ll put heaven in a rage
“you all know all the words , at least you used to...
you know how it goes , we wrote this for you”
though we seemed to come a long way in the blinking of an eye
for you it was no distance back at all
though you had a taste of glory and you kept my powder dry
at least you were invited to the ball
i’d go and give them passion , i’d show them how it’s done
out there in the middle of the park
in fur - lined coat , no microphone , i’d hit the notes for fun
floodlights off and singing in the dark
“you know all the words , at least you used to...
you know how it goes , we wrote this for you
we gave you a sense of where you belong ;
you never believed it was only a song”
so backstage at the ballroom , with our favourite engineer
all the press we ever used to know
a&r , producers and the management are here
turning off the lights after the show
the wings may well be buzzing , then again they always did
now’s the time to go and do our stuff
this could be our one last chance , our very final bid
let’s go out now and see if that’s enough
“you all know the words , at least you used to...
you know how it goes , we wrote this for you”
of course you’ve moved on , changes need ringing
if it was just a phase , why are you singing ?
we gave you a sense which you haven’t outgrown ;
you still need to know you are not alone
“we know all the words , at least we used to...
we know how it goes , we learned this from you”
