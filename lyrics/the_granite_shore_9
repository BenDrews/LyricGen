the dust dies down the hunt moves on
the thundering hooves and the hounds are gone
a pregnant peace descends upon
the blithe bucolic game
they sweep past in a swathe of red
you'd swear blind no actual blood was shed
and at the ditch they all stop dead
frozen in mid - frame
see them now on chocolate boxes
once they've airbrushed out the fox's flight
quaint honour burning bright
and our time will come again
your 'phone won't work far from the green
the masts are few and far between
there's violence felt but seldom seen
so red in tooth and claw
so put away the guns and lamps
make sure that there are access ramps
and in case of rising damp
get sandbags for the floor
garden gnomes flying aspidistras
dangling rods at their koi mistresses
a pond as small as this
with marvels yet untold
look for new names in the churchyard
thousand - year - old yews on guard
the chasm's short but still as wide
now they all insist on going inside
premium rates for the mausoleum
bury them where the poor can't see them hide
eternally cross - eyed
interred the wrong way round
there's a fibre - optic raceway through which
data's running pure and true and cold
the tide's too strong to hold
the flood of fortune down
