well you can make any day the greatest day
just visualize peace when you play this
i'm not saying my whole life's a meditative state
but i was calm , cool , collect when i laid this
call me the grouch , but i don't get upset
kick a verse through the speaker , get my gouda , then jet
back to my fam , i live the life of a man
two cars , two dogs , a wife , and a plan
i told you i was making sense
all else will make you crazy like following trends
but keeping up with the neighbors won't save ya
i'm deep enough to know myself ; now that's major
and i'm proud of me
no male figure to teach me how to be
oh well
too eager to reach outerly , i should have known
if all was good at home , i wouldn't have grown
i put it in poem to show 'em a better way
something abstract and clever , not led astray
break bread , make good , awaken
we takin' this hip hop back to self - creation
meaning i can say whatever i want
and i don't have to act a certain way to make a chunk
ain't a punk just because it's not the same as before
temptation lures , but my aim is pure
it used to be stress ; now it is breath
it used to be broke ; now it's invest
it used to be faded , and now it's controlled
it used to be underground ; now it's known
it used to be young , and now it's classic
it's still good music , and it still is magic
i still am feelin' true to myself
my family , my friends , my everyone else
and now i'm smarter ; i put a filter on my water
and i bless my home cause i'm raising a daughter
can't be a porn addict no more ; that's smaller
than who i'm supposed to be ; hoes , please don't holler ( hey , grouch ! )
i can hear the call of the wild
another man down , swallowed by the mob of the crowd
but i hold my ground , speak loud
tell them simple is the new cool , young fool
sober is the new drunk , pregnant's new skinny
how long you gonna fuck the world and ride on enemies
supplied amenities , i use them
i don't rely on crutches though , plus it's oozin'
out the pores of my skin , pure truth
and when combined with the beat , you feel the music
literally healing movement
watch the expressions change from blank to student
and all the people say don't stop doin' it
so i won't be one to badly influence them again
just fill my soul as ink from the pen
i think , fill a hole for every now and then
it used to be stress ; now it is breath
it used to be broke ; now it's invest
it used to be faded , and now it's controlled
it used to be underground ; now it's known
it used to be young , and now it's classic
it's still good music , and it still is magic
i still am feelin' true to myself
my family , my friends , my everyone else
