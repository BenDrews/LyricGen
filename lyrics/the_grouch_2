take me to l.a. ( x4 )
back to the bay ( x4 )
i grew up in the bay
so i'm down to earth
i live in l.a
that means i'm down to work
i got a laid back style
but i like to floss it
vans and chucks inside my closet
la face with an oakland booty
that's what my wife got
she don't act snooty
ay that's a bay thang
so come with that a game
but b on the a list
to c an la chick
los angeles we all can't handle it
some call it plastic
that's just the half of it
like the cows on the 5 when you mashin' quick
that's a drive but it flies when you passionate
yeah... i got family up north
homies down south man its all home court
we take it back and forth
some oakland raiders
the bay to la , like amoeba player
what did you think this was
la to the bay , the buzz
the buzz , the buzz
what did you think this was
la to the bay , the buzz
the buzz , the buzz
i keep my hustle you know
i make it go
the bay to la , the bay to la
uh , and all my homies say " rip ! "
when i first got to the bay , i straight tripped
blood ! blood !
what's that all about ?
tommy's got these broads sayin' blood in his house ?
cuz , but i ain't thugged out
ignorance off my chest i let it out
( it's all good ) now i'm back on my grind
on telegraph with them fat ass dimes
( i got tapes ) see the bay got that lime
and la we was still smokin brown at the time
ugg , so when i got back home
fools wasn't tryin to hear three - fifty for a 'zone
hell naw ! that's until they got blown
and they came to my door like cuz its on ! blood !
now i'm goin back and forth
greyhound hella green in my green jansport
( chorus extended )
tajai was the first dude i heard say hyphy
back in '97 when nobody liked me
or should i say liked us ?
packed in the rv didn't have a tour bus
no ! but we had that heart though
intrigued by that old freestyle leimert park flow
la , g - funk and bay area slang
a , w up cause its all the same
1996 was the hall of game
whole damn summer had the streets on flame ( flame )
but i'm kind of ashamed
that i slept on mac dre
godfather of the game
wake up , cake up , pilot auto
in oakland it's tacos

thought you thought
it is what it is
los angeles baby , by way of town biz
