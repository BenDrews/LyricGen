what are you ?
i'm just a simple man
i like pretty things
i'm a simple man , really
i'm just a simple man
i like pretty things ; i like funny things
i like my high hats on eighth
notes , basic , don't double up the flow
i ride the beat ; you chase it
hennessey straight with the lemon squeezed to quench
sounds from the town , they pound with intent
experiment with this like it's different cause it is
they make the norm , and it's not what i live
i give my all and want to ball like y'all
but i can only spit my shit , you get it ?
i'm not a clone ; i got a zone , and grouch fits in
forever rockin' twenty - dollar pants to the end
i stand six - one and eat food with cheese in it
make g's and spend it at the music store
i never use no more than my head to be led where i'm goin'
knowin' points of interest well
and with the sense it takes to make underground tapes dope
i formulate how i set sail
whether direct or retail i prevail on tracks
borrow from a batch of , let's say , garbage - ass records
not too safe to me with few exceptions
true direction comes from inside the mind
and everything else is just accessory
that is my recipe for life , and the best of me
i want my lady here tonight caressin' me
now you can pay me in this type necessity
electricity of mic , invest in me the soul
i'm just a simple man
i like pretty things
i'm a simple man , really
i like funny things ; i like beans and rice
i'm just a simple man
i like stupid things
i'm a simple man , really
i like funny things ; i like cheap things
give me the body of a goddess face from god
it's odd how things fall in place
i'm all about good taste , expensive or not
no sensitive spot in you , i like what i got
now don't mistake man for mind , cause i'm not simple - minded
just logical , efficient and completely on time
with my thoughts in the process always bring progress
i guess this clockwork enabled me to not work
nine to five , i rhyme and drive to eat
check the internet , fuck and make a beat
go to wack show , sometimes it's still fun
we criticize fools for bitin' on big pun
since this is the west coast i like my hip - hop bumpin'
get heated off some wax with the side of sayin' something
in the trunk and in the earphones
i'll make it clear , homes
i'm all about how it sounds
i deal with audio
my graffiti looks like shit
i dress how i dress and can't really dance a lick
the chance is this shit might never catch on
but my friends like my songs , and i like my songs
life - long endeavors for the pleasure
measure of up to error comin' weak , that's the treasure
i'm just a simple man
i like basic things
i'm a simple man , really
i like pretty things ; i like dope things
i'm just a simple man
i like music fresh
i'm a simple man , get it ?
i'm just a simple man
i like pretty things ; i like pretty girls
