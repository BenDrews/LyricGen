good work is never finished
in this life we never get a day off
there's a reason why they sent us
so i'm not gon' lay low
pushin' 808's , woofin''til the days gone
fucking dj play my song
been doing this way long
already bruh , stay strong
walk slow , fade 'em all
we ain't gonna chase your dreams
not my thing , ace in hole
be yourself , you say so ?
greed and wealth though
we done felt straight broke
hella rich , they don't know
that's a trip there he go
little fellas feel the flow
little mamas in pajamas
what the time is ? seiko
psycho like no other
make your lover laugh
ha , ha , ha , ha , hee , hee , hee , hee
not too hard what's up with that
every where i run i aim where i'd begun
from the moon 'til morning sun
we're gonna keep rolling until it's done
when the sun rises , when the sun rises , when the sun rises
were gon' to do it again , we're gon' to do it again
my poetry flows from the bottom in the lake
we took em to the shoreline and caught em in the break
music is my religion , it's never been a mistake
even if you don't make it , you can listen in the same
the ears of the earth are the ones that i chase
innovative and never scared looking for your face
dangling a carrot at the end of a string running
not gunning for money even though money is needed
i'm gunning for cunning listeners to get the seed when i plant it
i'm trying to be demanded all the way around the planet
you can say i'm independent but i need my fans
g&e fans are the best and advanced , in the ear drum to fear nothing
hear nothing wack
open to the ways of the universe and back
to the simple conversations on the couch with dad
withstanding bullshit thrown our way
will only give us stronger legs
to ground to the earth like tree - trunks
peg that map , traveling matt
unraveling mysteries in the back of a wagon intact like that
space craft on the dock , blast off quick , its the way of the walk
its the way of the world , and the way that we talk
i'm always beginning right at the ending
well it's alright we going to run it tonight and let go
i'm always beginning right at the ending
well it's okay we got a brand - new day to let go ( x2 )
