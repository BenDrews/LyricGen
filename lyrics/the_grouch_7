i was a young boy that had big plans
now i’m just another shitty old man
i don’t have fun and i hate everything
the world owes me , so fuck you
glory days don’t mean shit to me
i drank a six - pack of apathy
life’s a bitch and so am i
the world owes me , so fuck you
wasted youth and a fistful of ideals
i had a young and optimistic point of view
wasted youth and a fistful of ideals
i had a young and optimistic point of view
i’ve decomposed , yet my gut’s getting fat
oh my god , i’m turning out like my dad
i’m always rude , i’ve got a bad attitude
the world owes me , so fuck you
the wife’s a nag and the kid’s fucking up
i don’t have sex cause i can’t get it up
i’m just a grouch sitting on the couch
the world owes me , so fuck you
wasted youth and a fistful of ideals
i had a young and optimistic point of view
wasted youth and a fistful of ideals
i had a young and optimistic point of view
’til i grew up
i was a young boy that had big plans
now i’m just another shitty old man
i don’t have fun and i hate everything
the world owes me , so fuck you
glory days don’t mean shit to me
i drank a six - pack of apathy
life’s a bitch and so am i
the world owes me , so fuck you
the world owes me , so fuck you
the world owes me , so fuck you
