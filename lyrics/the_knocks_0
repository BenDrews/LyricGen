most girls don't tick all of the boxes
more baggage than my la ex and don't know who the knocks is
most girls are made - in - china plastics
over - the - counter counterfeits , emotional gymnastics
it's summertime in los angeles
breathing easy on the sand 'til the sunburn hits
in the studio with dan , dedicating my lips
to the girl i'm gonna man
hell , we're gonna be famous
come on and roll me up the sun
cause i'm on one
i wish i could find my taylor swift
be bad as hell , take no one's shit
she'd be a boss and so legit
i , i , i , i
i wish i could find my sweet escape
we could drink pink lemonade
and stay in bed and dream away
i , i , i , i
i wish
most girls are beautiful in pictures
they're smoke - and - mirror juliets , they're penn and teller sisters
yeah , most girls are post - traumatic stresses
my fight or flight is up all night untangling their messes
like summertime in los angeles
breathing easy on the sand til the sunburn hits
in the studio with dan , dedicating my lips
to the girl i'm gonna man
hell , we're gonna be famous
come on and roll me up the sun
cause i'm on one
i wish i could find my taylor swift
be bad as hell , take no one's shit
she'd be a boss and so legit
i , i , i , i
yeah , i wish i could find my sweet escape
we could drink pink lemonade
and stay in bed and dream away
i , i , i , i
i wish
and all the valley girls will come
with me and ringo on the drums
yeah , i'm on one
i wish i could find my taylor swift
be bad as hell , take no one's shit
she'd be a boss and so legit
i , i , i , i
yeah , i wish i could find my sweet escape
we could drink pink lemonade
and stay in bed and dream away
i , i , i , i
i wish
