poppin' , knockin' when i met you
shorty had the long extensions
told her i’m a bad man
but i only got the best intentions
rougher , tougher , not a bluffer
i want you to be my lover
we don’t have to take it undercover
just under the covers
bells are ringing , people singing
rice is throwin' , flower bringing
ting a ling a ling
the honeymoon is when we goin' in
i take you to a place that you didn’t even know exist
what’s your wish
dinner at the eiffel tower in paris
shottas in the basement party
turned into the greatest party
never seen my baby comin'
just one hit and we went up
am i in love or trippin'
now i feel my body driftin'
baby girl she got me lifted
am i addicted ?
she’s so fly
excuse her while she kiss the sky
excuse her while she kiss the sky
she’s so high
excuse her while she kiss the sky
excuse her while she kiss the sky
jaw droppin' when she walkin'
kinda thing that happen often
more than just a little happy
shuttin' down a city block
the latest gear is what she wear
you see that stunner in her ear
fashion week all year
throwin' money in the air
i’m just happy with my lady
other girls they wanna hate her
it come with the territory
ball players wanna date her
all we got is loyalty
i’m treatin' you like royalty
i’mma spoil you every day of the week
shottas in the basement party
turned into the greatest party
never seen my baby comin'
just one hit and we went up
am i in love or trippin'
now i feel my body driftin'
baby girl she got me lifted
am i addicted ?
she’s so fly
excuse her while she kiss the sky
excuse her while she kiss the sky
she’s so high
excuse her while she kiss the sky
excuse her while she kiss the sky
hey baby , baby , hey baby
hey baby , baby , hey baby
take a breath
inhale , exhale , now breathe baby
hey baby , baby , hey baby
hey baby , baby , hey baby
inhale , exhale , let’s take a breath and breathe baby
she’s so fly
excuse her while she kiss the sky
excuse her while she kiss the sky
she’s so high
excuse her while she kiss the sky
excuse her while she kiss the sky
excuse her while she kiss the sky
excuse her while she kiss the sky
excuse her while she kiss the sky
excuse her while she kiss the sky
