i hear thunder in the distance
and it hits me in an instant
crashing through my heart and i'm blown apart
you don't love me like that , you don't love me like that
i feel the cool wind coming in before the summer rain
eyes to the sky staring into the blue like it's not gonna end
remember we needed all our days and nights
to get enough of us to satisfy
we played that out a thousand times
now i hear thunder in the distance
and it hits me in an instant
crashing through my heart and i'm blown apart
you don't love me like that ( you don't love me like that )
yeah , i hear thunder in the distance
and the storm is in our system
i've been shaken out ; i can see it now
you don't love me like that ( you don't love me like that )
i feel the cool wind coming in before the summer rain
eyes to the sky staring into the blue like it's not gonna end
remember we had a force like oh , my god
too fast , too strong , too hard to stop
remember when we couldn't get enough ?
