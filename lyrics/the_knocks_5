starlight we go blind
softly , we fall without a sound
i'll be on your side
just hold me , hold me , hold me down
it's all yours , i've been saving for you
come collect all my love , there's no substitute
you know just what to do
come collect all my love , come collect all my love
sweet hurt , a firework
shooting me straight for lost to found
i need you , yes i'm sure
hold me , hold me , hold me down
it's all yours , i've been saving for you
come collect all my love , there's no substitute
you know just what to do
come collect all my love , come collect all my love
