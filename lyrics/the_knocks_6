how could i ever resist the pull ?
ten thousand loves that could save my soul
i tried , but you know i save the best for last
won't let your love , oh , become the past
don't let the ghost drive you from your home
swallow your pride deep , let it go
in the distance there's a calling bell
into the future i am running
i'm saving the best for last
i'm waiting to turn the tide
i'm saving the best for last
i'm making up the time ( saving the best for last )
in the distance , there's a calling bell
into the future through the hounds of hell
i try into the fire , you're a falling star
in your eyes , oh , i see it all
how could i ever resist the pull ?
they told me love , it could save my soul
i try , but you know i save the best for last
i'm breaking away now
i'm saving the best for last
i'm waiting to turn the tide
i'm saving the best for last
i'm making up the time ( making up the time )
in the distance , there's a calling bell
into the future through the hounds of hell
i try into , you're a falling star
in your eyes , oh , i see it all
how could i ever resist the pull ?
they told me love , it could save my soul
i try , but you know i save the best for last
i'm breaking away now
i'm saving the best for last ( could you follow me ? could you wait for me ? could you come with me ? )
i'm waiting to turn the tide ( could you follow me ? could you wait for me ? could you come with me ? )
i'm saving the best for last ( could you follow me ? could you wait for me ? could you come with me ? )
i'm making up the time ( could you follow me ? could you wait for me ? could you come with me ? )
i'm saving the best for last
i'm saving the best for last
