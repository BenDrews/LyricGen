new york city
welcome to medina , the mecca , the melting pot
where you could be playin' ball or sellin' rocks
tell the cops , they don't care
if you starvin' , they won't share
all they'll say is , " get your own , mothafucka' "
see the love isn't unconditional
a demonstration of unification is uncivilized
if you're ahead of the game , it's you they epitomize
but all these bright lights , how could you not visualize ?
the apple is rotten , but i love it
we're in new york
42nd and broadway , you'll see a play
142nd and broadway , see the yay
i've written rules you follow , it's no need to say
they take your chips , i ain't talkin' no frito lay
we're in new york
no allstate or geico
but she got that money for lipo'
in the trunk , most of us got the rifle
get your purse snatched from a psycho in
we're in new york
when i watched the towers fall
but nobody takin' ours , y'all
20 gunshots , call that a shower , y'all
money , respect , don't forget the power , y'all
we're in new york
certain beef you can't call off
so get holes in your body , like a golf course
yeah , shotty to the brain
see you thought it was a game , but...
we're in new york city
we're in new york city
we're in new york city
when i watched the towers fall
we're in new york city
nobody takin' ours , y'all
