i , i don't know why we're
screamin' so loud , we're only wastin' our time
we're safe roads away
there's no comin' back for us
turn around , turn around now , baby
don't let it go too far
turn around while it's not too late
don't let it run from us
we lie
we fight
sometimes
but oh , we love , ooh
why , why are we playin' ?
playin' with time , time isn't too good at waitin'
when time runs away
there's no comin' back for us
ooh , no
turn around , turn around now , baby
don't let it go too far
turn around while it's not too late
don't let it run from us
we lie
we fight
sometimes
but oh , we love , ooh
we lie
we fight
sometimes
but oh , we love , ooh
we love , we love
we love , we love
we love , we love , we love
