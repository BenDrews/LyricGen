ah , ah , when i was younger
i , i should've known better
and i can't feel no remorse
and you don't feel nothing back
( ah , ah ! ) got a new girlfriend
he feels like he's on top
and i don't feel no remorse
and you can't see past my blindness
oh , ophelia
you've been on my mind , girl , since the flood
oh , ophelia
heaven help the fool who falls in love
i , i got a little paycheck
you got big plans and you gotta move ( whoo ! )
and i don't feel nothing at all
and you can't feel nothing small
honey , i love you
that's all she wrote
oh , ophelia
you've been on my mind , girl , like a drug
oh , ophelia
heaven help the fool who falls in love
oh , ophelia
you've been on my mind , girl , since the flood
oh , ophelia
heaven help the fool who falls in love
oh , ophelia
you've been on my mind , girl , like a drug
oh , ophelia
heaven help the fool who falls in love
