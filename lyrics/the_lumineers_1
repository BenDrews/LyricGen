i been trying to do it right
i been living a lonely life
i been sleepin' here instead
i been sleepin' in my bed
i been sleepin' in my bed
so show me family
all the blood that i will bleed
i don't know where i belong
i don't know where i went wrong
but i can write a song
i belong with you , you belong with me
you're my sweetheart
i belong with you , you belong with me
you're my sweetheart
i don't think you're right for him
think of what it might have been if we
took a bus to chinatown
i'd be standin' on canal , and bowery
and she'd be standin' next to me
i belong with you , you belong with me
you're my sweetheart
i belong with you , you belong with me
you're my sweetheart
love we need it now
let's hope for some
cause oh , we're bleedin' out
i belong with you , you belong with me
you're my sweetheart
i belong with you , you belong with me
you're my sweetheart
