i was cleopatra , i was young and an actress
when you knelt by my mattress , and asked for my hand
but i was sad you asked it , as i laid in a black dress
with my father in a casket , i had no plans
and i left the footprints , the mud stained on the carpet
and it hardened like my heart did when you left town
but i must admit it , that i would marry you in an instant
damn your wife , i'd be your mistress just to have you around
but i was late for this , late for that , late for the love of my life
and when i die alone , when i die alone , when i die i'll be on time
while the church discouraged , any lust that burned within me
yes my flesh , it was my currency , but i held true
so i drive a taxi , and the traffic distracts me
from the strangers in my backseat , they remind me of you
but i was late for this , late for that , late for the love of my life
and when i die alone , when i die alone , when i die i'll be on time
and the only gifts from my lord were a birth and a divorce
but i've read this script and the costume fits , so i'll play my part
i was cleopatra , i was taller than the rafters
but that's all in the past now , gone with the wind
now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
it's a bed and a bathroom
and a place for the end
i won't be late for this , late for that , late for the love of my life
and when i die alone , when i die alone , when i die i'll be on time
