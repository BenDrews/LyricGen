she’ll lie and steal and cheat
and beg you from her knees
make you think she means it this time
she’ll tear a hole in you the one you can’t repair
but i still love her
i don’t really care
when we were young , oh oh we did enough
when it got cold , ooh ooh we bundled up
i can’t be told , ah ah it can’t be done
it’s better to feel pain than nothing at all
the opposite of love is indifference
so pay attention now
i’m standing on your porch screamin' out
and i won’t leave until you come downstairs
so keep your head up keep your love
so keep your head up , my love
so keep your head up , my love
so keep your head up keep your love
and i don’t blame you
for running like you did all these years
i would do the same , you best believe
and the highway signs say we’re close
but i don’t read those things anymore
i never trusted my own eyes
so keep your head up , my love
head up , love
head up , love
head up , love
head up , love
