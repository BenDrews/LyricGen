oh , the devil's inside
you opened the door
you gave him a ride
too young to know , too old to admit
that you couldn't see how it ends
what did you do to my eyes
what did you sing to that lonely child
promised it all but you lied
you better slow down baby soon
it's all or nothing to you
the glow of hollywood signs
they sold you a bridge
they fed you the lines ( they fed you to lions )
you always confused your servants for friends
but you couldn't see how it ends
it's all or nothing to you
what did you do to my eyes
what did you say to my only child
promised your love but you lied
you better slow down baby soon
it's all or nothing to you
what did you do to my eyes
what did you sing to that lonely child
promised it all but you lied
you better slow down baby soon
