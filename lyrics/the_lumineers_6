when you left this town , with your windows down
and the wilderness inside
let the exits pass , all the tar and glass
'til the road and sky align
the strangers in this town
they raise you up just to cut you down
oh , angela , it's a long time coming
and your volvo lights lit up green and white
with the cities on the signs
but you held your course to some distant war
in the corners of your mind
from the second time around
the only love i ever found
oh angela it's a long time coming
home at last
were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
with your fingers in a fist
did you hear the notes , all those static codes
in the radio abyss ?
strangers in this town
they raise you up just to cut you down
oh angela it's a long time coming
oh angela spent your whole life running away
home at last
home at last
vacancy , hotel room , lost in me , lost in you
angela , on my knee , i belong , i believe
home at last
home at last
home at last
home at last
home at last
