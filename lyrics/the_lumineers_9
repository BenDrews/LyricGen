it's a lonely road
full of tired man
and you can see it in their faces
and you'll be home in spring
i can wait 'til then
i heard you're on the big train
and oh , this too shall pass
this loneliness won't last for long
i wasn't there to take his place
i was ten thousand miles away
so when you hear my voice
when you say my name
may it never give you pain
but i don't wanna go
but it's time to leave
you'll be on my mind , my destiny
and i won't fight in vain
i'll love you just the same , oh
i couldn't know what's in your mind
but i saw the pictures , you're looking fine
and there was a time when i stood in line
for love , for love , for love
but i let you go , oh
i let you go
and he fell apart
with his broken heart
and this blood , this blood , this blood
oh , it drains from my skin , it does
