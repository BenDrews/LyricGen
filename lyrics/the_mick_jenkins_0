you were never ready for the flow
when the rain don't fall so hard no more
and the bank won't take my card no more
but they ain't gon' pull my card neither
and they ain't gon' pull my squads either
niggas spit shit , i hock ether
stephen hawking , no need for talking
got a hawk's eye , but i can hardly see you
talk's fly , pray you're not aaliyah
i ain't trying to rock the boat , but the flow crazy
i paint pictures , but they're not baroque
more scorsese , niggas made scores out of instrumentals
nigga type a script with a pen and pencil
use words from scripps national spelling bee
fuck is you telling me that didn't sound better
spitting it simple ? fuck with me , famo
ginger ale for your hoes
not shit else , not even my dick
man i got way too much on my mind
got a little light bout as bright as my bic
and y'all got way too much on the shine
y'all niggas don't tell enough of the truth in the booth
and it's proof you ain't fucking with mine , sip
water more important than the gold
people for the gold
everybody do it for the gold
people save your souls
water more important than the gold
people for the gold
everybody do it for the gold
people save your souls
thank god for the waters , waters

started from the bottom of the map
roll tide at the end of the wave
in this bitch ballpoint strapped
get back , this nigga got a pen to the page
permanent marks , i'm a marksman , i never miss
talk shit , that's a hint at your age
big chain , that's a hint that it cage
they're saying you're sane , but i'm gone in 60 seconds on a verse , that's mickalas cage
fuck with a black young man
i'm everything that it denotes
shit comes straight from the heart , not a record exec in the back with a remote
niggas gon' play their parts , save face on a face on the back of a c - note
everybody wanna be the back of a d - rose
but i can't go , van gogh how i handle
paintbrush when i paint flows
niggas in the club throwing pesos
niggas on the block throwing pitch forks
and not from barbados
i don't give a fuck how you rep your flag
catch him in the cut when he roll his truth
and i don't give a fuck how you stuff your bags
touch the sky , it's much more than trees
what can you tell me about your roots ?
spitting that truth like a cold white rapper , niggas gon' always need some proof
niggas gon' always need some water , niggas gon' always speak the truth
niggas gon' always want the messenger dead and they always need the proof
my god...
thank god for the waters , waters
thank god
thank god for the waters , waters
thank god
niggas gon' always need some water , niggas gon' always speak the truth
niggas gon' always want the messenger dead and they always want the proof
niggas gon' always need the proof
niggas gon' always need the proof
