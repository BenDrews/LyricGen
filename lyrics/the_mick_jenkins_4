uhhhh , uh uh uh uh
uhhhh
i just , wanna , see you find the light
i just , wanna , see you
hey where you going with all that gold , nigga ?
where you going with all that soul , nigga ?
if you can see the trees you can see the truth
but still the light can't reach the roots
roots , roots , roots , roots ( x2 )
doctor said his teeth were looking off white
he told him slow down on the cigs
didn't know that he was off pipe
shit was getting hazy
he was looking through the fog lights
famo wasn't seasoned
never touch the all spice
he boxed like all spark
he tony stark
grab the iron
tell any nigga weapons drawn
he was megatron that he didn't need the teflon
moments later chest was gone , fool
but check , it wasn't even the path that got him popped
just pussy popping the lips with a bad taste in his mouth
now you agitating the ops
you in the midst of the scene
and you face first with the fucks
and we chin check your regime
who that ? the free
i thought you knew that
nigga never seen a winter this cold
ask john cusack
that ice harvest put the shingles in your shoulder
dash of ginger , put the tingle in your folgers
hope you niggas awake
told too many stories that i wish were re - wrote
moving weight , but no al pacino
i got a different kilo
check the metrics on my shoulders
burden big as boulders
heavy over beats
see it was curtains 'fore it ever started
like the hornets when they left charolette
nigga flows like oceans thats uncharted
with sponge water
spit good pussy you come harder
drop lines like drunk barbers
they bob barker your soul
if you want the truth hit the roots
bring the carhartt for the cold
don't know sunshine down there
put your hands in the air one time
twerk for the fun times
cause the revolution would not be printing the sun times round here
they tell him that it's better when you do it for the cee lo
but you can't get that deep with no fucking c notes
we do this shit for the free and everything it denotes
make sure your roots don't need no remote
hope you niggas awake...
make sure your roots don't need no remote
hope you niggas awake...
