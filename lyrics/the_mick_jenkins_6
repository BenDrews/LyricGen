she lives in north dakota
she lives in my lap

she lives in new orleans
it ain't nothin' but a flight and you know it
it was in the park
had the sage burnin'
when i seen her
it was art
talk in person
leanin' and learnin' in between the laughter
brought our own water
she a martyr
can't put nothin' past her
said she want the world
didn't know how to get it
so i asked her
where she want to go
how much dough we gon' need to float
show me on the map
where you at
and where you tryin' go
we can spin the globe
we can do madrid
do milan
india , monaco
all i wanna know
know you're mine
show me on the map
show me on the map
show me on the map
show me on the map
she lives in north dakota
she lives in my lap
she hit me from her motorolla
