cause you never met another nigga quite like me
a southside nigga way too free

in the cut , twisting lemon kush and jasmine
lemon verbena candles burn slow
watch the verbs flow
i spit that fire they can feel it in the third row
he shoot deep , heroine , larry bird flow
they got your silver spoon heated
treat it like it's a product
the doctors approved , need it , read it
over here , it's ginger ale for your hoes
i don't want they souls
i move around if they want the gold
i can't fade it
it's the leaves mothafucka
it's the leaves mothafucka
tell me did you get to see em fall , mothafucka
tell me did you get to see em change , colors
it's the leaves mothafucka
tell me did you get to see the truth fall
did you niggas see it
floral prints for the nature enthusiasts
caramel apple spice with a hennessy nubian

she do not smoke but i'm rolling a fat spliff
we talk passions

and send this bitch up with these haikus
fuck with my famo
