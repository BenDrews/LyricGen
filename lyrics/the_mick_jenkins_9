i been in...4 countries in 5 days , that 8 flights
ate rice like 9 ways 'cross 3 cultures
see vultures , i see people dying 'round me
my mind state is...fucked...
i'm just tryna...yeah
( mm , yo that was good , i like whatever's that...shit ! )
hol'on hol' on ......
the papers are the blunts a no - no
no dibs on doobies , bout to get lit by my dolo
white grape white owl was my first love , i can't go no more though
movin' through this water , let me show you how its different , how i show - boat..
lifted , reminiscin' on them days when i would buy the pack to flip it..
..ahhhh it's really different...it's really...
for thirty talents most niggas be off balance
restore it with the writtens my hand'll be all callous , in no time
got up in this bitch but just like parking
they won't validate my shit without a cosign , can't play on both sides
he sleep with both eyes open , i be the token
black guy in the room full of people screaming " nigga " with me
now am i wrong if that's sitting with me ?
that " fuck it , i quote it , why hate if they wrote it " shit is feeling iffy
and all this water got me feeling misty , we making mad noise
tell them flamethrowers i be blastoise in your city
dropping dope i could have dealed to whitney
spark the piff and then he spit epiphany , swiftly
the aftermath is fifty - fifty , how you dealing with me
you either healing or you killing , know the weapons you wielding
no prosper , i be no doctor , naw , he much too sickly
you must believe it though , he must be ripley
shouts to bozart how these buckets fitting , homie where your thinking cap at ?
know what you seeking , but i ain't preaching , a deacon of sorts
hold your head boy they breaching your thoughts
have your soul for a fucking jesus piece and a porsche
a couple years pouring up , send a peace to your corpse
we lost one...just know that i can never get that jaded
if ever a bone to pick , know i'd never be dislocated
i'm off one , turning with the sage for the good vibes
better know you fucking with some good guys
but if you ever feel to drop sets from your hood at us
know that in a swift moment we could be goodfellas , it's not a game
drop flames like mario off the flower , cardio for an hour , these niggas ain't got no heart
i see ten men , but stay with the amens , making better decisions like my wisdom teeth came in
game man , learning , if i put it in laymans terms , you worms couldn't fuck with an early bird at your best
young lazarus on the rise , i'm laying it down to rest
i been in...4 countries in 5 days , that 8 flights
i ate rice like 9 ways cross 3 cultures
i see vultures , i see people dying 'round me
my mind state is...fucked...
spent way too much money for cheap shit like prom dates
yet , it still elongate
my pockets is lined with long faces and white tears
i'm lightyears ahead of the buzz y'all toyin' with
cowboyin' wit
makin' points i can't be much more poignant with...shit
{beat fades}
yeah , learned a lot of lessons at the end of the burner of nebuchadnezzar , you can toss me into the furnace
flip them the finger , only ever did the sojourner
the sirens is ringin' , pull over yo' pigment concern us
my pigment is blingin' , deep as the water
all you niggas ever seen was the surface but wait till i surface
you might catch a scene of me surfin' these waves but i move with a purpose
keep my faith and my patience because i'm moving with serpents
these niggas is thirsty , these bitches is thirsty
the industry lurkin...
the vibes in here perfect
