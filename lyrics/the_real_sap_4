down and out , all alone
sitting here , sad and ooh
the sun is now going down
it's kind a cold , seeking refuge
i trust a friendly face
or maybe just a smile
someone that understands
what i'm going through right now
and just before i
lay me down to never wake
i look up and i see you
so with everything i am
thank you
thank you
because you didn't have to
thank you
thank you
with everything i am
thank you
for the real sacrifice and the truth
behind your giving heart
and how you'd never judge or faulted me
helped me cause you wanted to
and for your friendly face
and for just your smiles
simply understanding that
what i'm going through right now
and just before i
because when no one else would care you did
and when no one else was there you were
now i am so aware
you're a blessing to me
what did i do to deserve
to deserve you
there's no words
that could describe
that could describe
how much i
