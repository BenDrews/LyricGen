i talk about the real , seperate the fakeness
fools gold has everybody out here chasin'
while these rappers betray , who they wanna be
drug cartels are who these heads emulate
lightning , lightning in a bottle
i capture the mind while most heads say ? role model
because that's what i got from my mom
i try to influence the youth , so i write these songs
heads coming no money , order fame
you're a waste , a disgrace , to this rap industry
damn , that really hits the heart
i could respond with war , i'd rather not start
heads take shots , you fall apart
and question everything , and why did you ever start
determination to be better than them
man , their not even worth a piece of my breath , gunniz
music for the people
and all that strive to be equals
separate yourself , from all the clones
be original , independent is always cool
music for the people
and all that strive to be equals
separate yourself , from all the clones
be original , independent is always cool
still a ways to go , in my raps yet
when people ask , i say i'm no where near the best
because , i'm a real artist
i strive with my craft even when times are the hardest
many rappers nowadays , hop on the mic and first thing they talk about is getting laid
paid , and all of that
i bet you wouldn't bring that content to your mom so she could realm in that
lightning will strike
so hard , if i indulge in anything that i hear through these songs
minaj , i'm tired of her music
everything she does is always so foolish
but , i'll never hate
she brings in the income that allows her to celebrate
one day we'll make a change , and help the generations to come state their names
