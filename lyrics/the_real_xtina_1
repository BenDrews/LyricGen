( intro , little moose )
quite important to protect particular detail pertaining to fact , when in fact
such stories are stretched by certain folk , who pull allure turning folktale into law
its a continued practice , law preaches amazement of epic proportions
now this specter story is being told as a tale of legend
( jack al mac x cross )
too stagnant ..this pad needs a fresh lethal dose
( hook 1 , little moose )
looking into quartz glass scripture , rock about some crystal clear come up reflection
magnified detective high gloss deflection on ya , got shelves full up encyclopedia
suspended in most regrettable rejection , sucking out such affection - but then i thought
choice or force , venom flows its course
pores poring stress out , accept being beast at best , burdening in rest no less poisonous
snakes hiss hitting pavement hard , dinos soar scars across skies disguised as your past
specter fangs will rip your entire shit up
specter attorney for hire , court addressed dragon spectacle emblazon fire
too many bestow value upon valuables
or is it that look of valor , entrusting power they shower high credentials
tap into your potentials , drop those mental walls
( verse 1 , jack a.m cross )
don't let morality trap your carefree boundary , cautious thought only corrals each step back into a walk so carefully
you see , my formality hath be known to tip toe , in cold half tone too closed & alone until told to condone
you be feeling this my spit is flavorless , debunking ya'll without remedy , you just ain't ready for me
turn around now and find an attorney cause
shit i'm about to conduct a racial calamity , repeat of dysfunctional rationality
unsurpassable accusations alluded accountable nationally
such - perpetual flow - motion - won't - know - whether to stop or go
it won't matter whether i neva' let you speak , it be better for every juror forever hearing me
take note of my suggestions , just nod your head approve shattering of your character
all that street cred is garbage , and now you is gonna eat nothing but my carnage
i remain inclined to my clientele line , in rhythm without interrupt
it all just happened so abrupt , looking at an exponential chain gang
swore not to let a single one hang
chaining me to the office desk , all my live time tied to every next who shall confess
ain't no one under arrest , but both my wrists handcuffed to your testament
overnight came and went , progress ascended such slow heat creeping in keeping fidelity as a tempting suggestion
client straight repressed , battered wife heavily molested
body shook , but those baby blue eyes been requesting
a deep shuteye , headrest caressing her hair over my chest - i'm such a sucker for a damsel in distress
i lived indiscriminate to criminal's illegitimate nature , notorious for court dismissal or minimal sentence
master of misdirection
and ain't it just so unjust that i die by defending such nonsense
shot to floor , handed it all over to hands of a crook , who stole prayer right out the good book
broke fuck fucked up his only chance of walking up right , an outright uproar murdered right there in court
you damn right i built up an unfulfilled fester , quick to learn method lead by wicked soul captor
reborn in burning resentment by laughless specter
rapid enraged rampant snappy haste with action
i was put into place , and it fit me like a haitian earthquake been hit by a haarp weather control application..
mainly it be set to fault where i felt tiger's heart fretting
shit bit me ripe tight beyond sight to bloodrage , but bet it i beat all its pain
dead it like a done feat intrepid , and it was beating intricate through my vesicular passage
flow - style - rhythm , slow shows stacked in rows , ticket sales closed
brother why don't you give them a taste
( hook 2 , little moose )
looking into quartz glass scripture , rock about some crystal clear come up reflection
magnified detective high gloss deflection on ya , got shelves full up encyclopedia
suspended in most regrettable rejection , sucking out such affection - but then i thought
forget it you fuck - who be tasting , devil's advocate dismissing temptation
surname jack , trade of all law , third name be x , excuse family cross across
courts clock , tummy ticks , case locked
slapped up with desire , specter attorney best driven liar alive for hire
reverse wit slipped in with discerning interest , lossless loose bond rooted evil seed of knowledge , planted medieval
singing shield defends path where sociopath murders personal wrath , quick page rip corner turn curiously inquired
evidence all willing in fixation of friction , inflicting hot hit heels
clicked to shape pattern , pouring raw wild tiger jaw
( verse 2 , jack a.m cross )
can't figure how anybody could ever showboat better , in even least smidgen of elation
than my living breathing , thick feeding into tension of court mob
so ready to embrace all potential pathways , best solved in sickest of resolves
then absolving myself from everything involved
sending someone into that combustible fit , lurking above it in corruption
flammable curves irking into nerves , twisting all tendon , dipping ten fingers down into phalanx
i'm that invisible troll , strangling esophagus of soul
stomping aura out , allowing loud reversal exorcist shouts
a specter's best trick beset to it , be shapeshift crafty face switch
most spectacular , spellbound in drawn blood being sucked by brother dracula
shadiest bachelor , pulls out death shade from under darth vader
paralyzing reader for a later chapter , in chronicles of specter
who is lesser of evil , plaguing off laws of land
strayed heart , mute guilt , cold hand - guiding crimes already sealed in defense
plotting loophole of blood splatter , each momentous swing uplifting pendulum of battle - hammer
forging flames , judged inner rage twisted into maniacal logic
episodic epilogues comically theatrical , drama - filled with
edgy Ã©tiquette , embellished horrific , but seasonal shifts
so epic in setting , most eloquent of expressions , quite stoic
palace laden facade forever fading into shadings of spatial relations
pounce on out , sick stare mortiferous , never missing this
won't dare sleep sane ever again
i don't care where you think you know spirits , but i am fucking vainest witch
cocking back blows into every vein this bitch forgot to stitch after her midnight heroine fit
here is a tight tiny zest for one of life's treasure chests , straight blessed out this specter's flapping gum
spitting from tip of my tongue , straight out the slum
bumping drums with a midnight run - in runt , running with flare on a production stunt
scene locked to script , screenplay stripped right from comic flip
so i rip magazine out from shelf , skip to back and spoil its end
with lady on makeup and her best friend ..
inevitably they both let it slip , so i approach producer with my suit & tie
well prepped , ironed
looking heli - jet fly , and let him know that they can sue this bitch
for violation on a clause of anti - disparagement
what the reaper sows feds wished they knows
i wanted to be close - ghost close
inside her medical record , i developed into a set of dyslexia
when the chicken pox only cursed her , my curse was worse
bird bumps left her skin first , but all her words was mixed up
dense , unable to read a fuckin thing
calculate it to where cost has got its profit , a fair share rounded square
and they will call you prophet , without a crystal ball
against odds and all , even will fall to criminal law
i be cutting corners , prosecuting coroners
sending rich into the poor house , pouring my heart out
cephalopod mollusk lifting tentacles over cross flow eight brains loose
now give em the chorus moose
( hook 3 , little moose )
looking into quartz glass scripture , rock about some come up reflection
magnified detective high gloss deflection on ya , got shelves full up encyclopedia
suspended in most regrettable rejection , sucking out such affection - but then i thought
oh of course - but call it to truth - solitary by choice , woodland elk
if found in pond pondering whats fond , i'd introduce " little moose "
now ain't that cute pal , but back on trail
jack al mac x cross , lies reliable
releasing massacre , freeing murderers
serial killing in succession , liable death - count over 2000
too many doused in fire , more never found , so must be hiding
bare coffins , empty cremations , cold jail cells
too many caught appraising bloodthirsty art of kill , then set free repeatedly
after paying hefty legal fees , threatening juries
twisting jurisdiction to fit misfits personal justice
cross courts corner wall clock , tick tick
tummy ticks , case locked
specter aspired attorney , sworn liar
but reversed , wit lip versed triple conundrum
dumb witty , slipped in a wonderful kiss , with discerning interest
lossless loose bond rooted majestic , seed of knowledge , planted medieval magic
sticks & stone shields defend imaginary path , where sociopath murdered own personal wrath
ripped shoulder page turner , evidently inquired required evidence
all willing to fixation of friction , most inflicting
unwilling quitter , before hitting heels
clicking its shape pattern , pouring liquid raw torn tiger jaw
stable more so than even sabre tooth monster
( verse 3 , jack a.m cross )
exfoliating big bangs too sharp for shark fangs and too holla - terrific for hair bangs hanging in yo' chi like ying yang probing with this pro - bang tough tug bugger'd sipping meringue ginseng shebang that pang harangue ting sunning' it up
( verse 4 , little moose )
jack x has xhibited cross over , joining ranks of ghost soldier
xtinct in most unusual of jinx , instinctual proof our death bed sinks rotten sinkhole blotted
xtracts dark soul xtra black n crisp
jack al mac x cross , exists spatially lawless
lost without source , fear lecher , never let ya
take a long breath , bet ya scared past death
aesthetic awareness , stuck without credit , incredibly at loss tossed
( verse 5 , jack a.m cross )
tossed indelibly perceptual , far off foreign shores
foresight fallen for , despite all four his eyes , ripped 20/20 to the core
hot - headed heartless , haunted torn out injustice
lossless spirit , impractical past neurotic
stumbling sick brick brolic , im talking master heister , mint lustre
laugh less specter , best when boss , accepting a black cross
6 ft under course , type - letter tipped in cheddar , real go - getter
chess rook checker , best make checkmate , smiling specter
perspective making you face all your flaws , no biting back - wit dem tiger jaws
voice suddenly hoarse , bothered and gnawed
channeling bullet whore , kilroy , clip addict
kept with kleptic , trapped ruthless , truth mixed up to vexed voices
part hysteria , partial to paraphernalia
sensually sucked dry , by his own patriotic laws
of course , coulda stayed home , shoulda watched his daughter grow
woulda if he known , what fate had in store
strapped to a wooden pole , wouldn't you know
its the one you were told was hand sewn , by voodoo priestess
seemed nice enough gift for christmas , its sitting in your basement
where to your amazement , brazen cries are heard
tortured to lies , by hectic enemies , chain - laughing
pain exchanged between ten hands , insanely dancing
hogtied to pole , where your ghost has been sterilized
sworn in convict , cheated by all human logic
who breached enemy lines , a timeless warrior
vectorized in worst sector , ever to be oppressed
human tissue , inhumanely tested
a prisoner of war , stripped correct till neglect
ridiculed , cruelest specter , intuition like a lawyer
gainful insight , to spend his time right
proper prim invested , good riddance
kilroy's sins freshly rejected , just as expected
soldier spirit spit out as a hinderance , at heaven's door
jack cross , quick like a satellite unicorn
transformed , before final blood was drawn
lewd ropes torn , here before , roaring storm
from roaring tiger , who was seen , clawing each korean clean
into 5 hundred pieces , cut to death , without peace
pieced together , pleasing the seamstress
all preened accrue one giant tomb , united each soul
ejected , erratically bled till dead
fat fingers , funneling a fatter head
the picture said , more than a million stories read
child bred , and born , in middle of foggy mist
rifting pissed , passed thundering storm
once missed , massed , shifting rift - raft
crank shaft crypt craft , cryptic , mislead sick shit
taking prolong shits , on top of court , now adjourn
until recess returns , taking precedence to president's righteous haunt
he surely won't want , his child daunted
to loss , let alone scarred
fourscore soreness , jack cross tempted to what he saw
showtime allure , spotlight , leave it all on the floor
close the curtains nevermore
