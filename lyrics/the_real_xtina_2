#howiquitspin 1. i moved to france on the day gwb was inaugurated. email was a little squiggly in 2001 but good enough.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 2. so i kept my spin gig. the contract details matter.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 3. had a year contract that expected a certain # of words total ( feat/review/column ) & got paid monthly , direct deposit.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 4. i have a cheap studio in paris & i am getting cds by fedex & writing my fucking pieces & eating berthillon. it’s *the life*
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 5. but bc i’m me i start to feel bad about it. my politics are clarifying in this period , intensifying , weighing on me.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 6. i start to feel like i am just selling stuff to kids and its not really what i want to be doing and it doesn’t feel right.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 7. worse each week. hypocritical. also i am less connected to spin since they fired craig marks. so i start to think i’m done.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 8. i think this a lot. and finally , maybe in may , i decide that i will get myself fired , bc quitting seems onerous and dull.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 9. the world gives me a clear shot , spin sends me a cd to review : party music by the coup. now this is a cd to get fired with.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin end of chapter one. time to make dinner.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 10. you know the coup , party music. ride the fence. 8000000 ways to kill a ceo. the best of revleft hiphop. i have 400 words.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 11. for 200 words i describe the album very conventional. but the second half of the review shifts gears.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 12. the 2nd half says , if u just listen to this album , yr a poseur. it’s a 5. there’s only one way to take the album seriously
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 13. thats to go down to the spin offices & throw a brick thru the window. i give the address. if u do this , i write , its a 10.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 14. i assume they will fire me immediately. but if they don’t i am ready to insist they print it which obvs they cant do…
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 15. & i will keep insisting & then they will fire me. foolproof plan. nonetheless im anxious waiting 2 hear back from the ed.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 17. he replies on schedule. it’s jon dolan , sweet guy , they love it. they want to tweak a word or 2 , totally minor , the usual.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 18. this is the moment of true despair. it is then that i know i have lost. had lost long ago.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 19. they know what i have been busily not knowing : it’s all perfectly wrapped in the cellophane of irony , lacking all salience
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 20. it’s just show and if you think what you say means anything you’re kidding yourself. i have 3 days of black depression.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 21. i decide i have to quit , even though its my only income. spin’s been good to me , paid me well , said nice things. but ok.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 22. my weird feeling is this : that we have been gong out so long , i have to break up with spin in person. it feels right.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 23. but there’s a problem : i don’t really have the spare cash for a transatlantic flight. this is where u2 comes in.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin end of chapter 2
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 24. so the problem is this : i need money to fly paris>newyork to quit spin in person like the decent fellow i pretend to be.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 25. i see that u2 is playing parc bercy the next month , august 18th.. so i concoct a plan. i arrange to get passes to the show
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 26. and not just passes , but the kind that let you into the literally heart - shaped closed off area stage front.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 27. usually this area’s for , i dunno , nelson mandela and whatever , but i am ( still ) a spin senior writer and i have some moves
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 28. i make the moves , i get the passes , i wait for the show , in the meantime , i read this piece in the village voice.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 29. it says that godard’s band of outsiders , out of circulation for near 40 yrs , is being shown at film forum , end of summer.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 30. that seems like a good irony. i will fly paris>nyc to see a french movie. now i know my travel dates ; just need the ticket
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 31. so aug 18 rolls around. i walk down to parc bercy. it’s warm and i am wearing a leather jacket , i don’t know why.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 32. outside bercy there are many u2 fans milling , some without tickets just as i hoped. i hold my special passes in the air.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 33. eventually i find a flight attendant for american who loves u2 so much that she has come from dublin w/o tickets.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 34. couldn’t be better. she trades me 250 in vouchers for a ticket and a special pass. i keep one and see the show.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 35. this is a terrible decision for i am heavy bored , “kite” us the worst. everything else is in a huge tie for second worst.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 36. i walk home sweating , reflecting on how u2 is probably the worst popular band in the world. i blame jesus. jesus and bono.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 37. but the next day i take the vouchers to the aa offices and buy my ticket to nyc. it’s during band of outsider’s last week :
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 38. i schedule it so that i will fly in , have one day and night to myself and then it’s time to quit the only job i have.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 39. we have an appointment and everything , tuesday morning , in the building whose address i have suggested for rock - throwing.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin they of course don’t know why i have made the appointment. until then i do my work. nothing to do but wait.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin end of chapter three
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 41. so the day comes to fly off to nyc ; haven’t been back since gwb took office. 2 months since coup review , 3 weeks since u2
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 42. i stay with a friend in stuyvesant town , 20th & first in manhattan. it’s near the best bagel shop in the world , now closed
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 43. head off to see band of outsiders , the only sixties godard i have never seen. it is magical. i am filled with delight —
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 44. even though next morning i will have to trudge into the office of someone i don’t like & say stuff that will aggravate her
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 45. but for now it’s still monday night and i am feeling good , a little jet - lagged. i walk east in the new york evening.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 46. there are posters along all the scaffoldings for cds out the next day. i am oddly excited for the tori amos covers album.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 47. but i realize w great sadness i will not getting all my music for free anymore. i meet a friend at a bar on st. marks.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin48. we talk about the movie , about godard & ashbery & dylan , the 3 great postwar artists if you only count white men.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 49. we talk about friends & poetry ( later we will start a small press ) & then i get tired & there can be no more delaying.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 50. i go back to stuyvesant town & fold out the couch , woozy , my last night as an employed person. strange little girls.

#howiquitspin 51. i wake early on tuesday bc still on europe time. i’ve been a journalist for 5 years. before that i borrowed money for rent
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 52. i recall this keenly. i recall sleeping on the banks of the charles river. it is unclear to me i will get another job.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 53. i remind myself the world doesn’t let mid - class white guys starve , that this tightrope always has a net if yr in my shoes.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 54. bc this is the terrible thing i have come to know. i try to let the terrible knowledge calm me down.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 55. its still a few hours before the meeting where i will quit spin , it’s maybe 7 : 30 , so i decide to go for a run.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 56. i have a coffee , some water , hang around a minute , and i am ready to go. i have on this run many times.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 57. i head over to the east river & down , past the softball fields & soccer pitch , along the promenade.

— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
end of chapter five
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 61. theres nowhere to go from there but thats the thing , stories keep going when theres no place to go. a demoralizing fact.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 62. the peak comes too early or too late , there’s no denouement or too much , it’s a dying fall either way.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 63. and for all that 11 : 00 comes an hour after 10 : 00 no matter what. even when such things seem impossible.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 64. sure enough 11 comes an hour after ten. in that period my host ( a good friend ) and i watch the crashes a hundred times.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 65. he doesnt have cable but theres that station w its antenna in jersey. we watch from 11 to noon , noon to 1. we r transfixed
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 66. the same few seconds over & over. periodically we try to reach my friend who works next to the wtc , but phones dont work.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 67. eventually we snap out of it a little , amid rumors of other attacks , planes unaccounted for. all air traffic is grounded.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 68. we decide we will go downstairs to the market to get supplies , staples. it seems somewhat crazy to leave the apartment.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 69. but we do , we go down to the supermarket. line is out the door into the street and everybody is terrified and chatty.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 70. its sort of the famous communality every1 talked about. its sort of like nervous talking when you’re a rookie shoplifter.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 71. like just hoping it will smooth things over & you’ll get home safe. water is sold out ; we get what we can & go back up.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 72. i havent even checked w spin , theres no way to check , . i just assume our meeting is cancelled.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 73. like , holy shit , al quaeda *really* wants me to keep my gig as a music journalist.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 74. eventually we hear fr missing friend , ok but shook , trapped on subway under wtc for 5 hours , walked home to the upper west
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 75. there r reports that the air dwntwn is toxic , all the vaporized plastic. we think about r friend walking 6 - 7 miles home.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 76. eventually we decide , wednesday , to stop watching the crashes on tv and walk up to my friend’s dad’s place also upper west
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 77. it feels a but like an epic journey. we fortify ourselves at the best bagel shop in the world , which is open. in fact…
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 78. …they are doing banner biz bc they r around the corner fr 13th precinct and all cops are on duty. it’s *packed& w cops.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 79. everybody talks abt heroism of 1st responders but i feel the same , furious to be in a place filled w cops. still hate cops
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 80. we get our bagels & walk uptown , it takes forever. the air smells funny but this could just be a fantasy. we move slowly.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 81. lots of people on streets , all a little out of it. lots of nodding , semi - verbal communication , no actual conversations.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 82. finally we arrive. ive never met freinds dad. he moved from australia years before. teaches at cuny. im shy to meet him.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 83. but also we realize waiting for the apt door to open it will be the first real conversation abt the events we’ve had…
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 84. …except w each other. our discourse to this point has mostly been “holy shit holy shit holy shit holy shit holy shit.”
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 85. tony opens the door. shorter than i expected , graying red beard. long pause. my friend says to his dad , what do you think ?
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 86. this will literally be the first opinion we have heard not fed to us by the television. we have been utterly bewildered.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 87. tony hesitates , smiles , a warm smile , a calming and infectious smile , says well they had to come down sooner or later.

#howiquitspin 89. the planes still aren’t flying and i have to rebook my flight back to france. first i reschedule my spin meeting.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 90. breaking up is hard. i schedule the meeting for a week later and then rebook my ticket home.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 91. i feel like the oddity of having flown into nyc on a caprice a day before 9/11 means i am probably a terrorist.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 92. this feeling will last for weeks , months. its a time of paranoia. i miss four days of running , first time in a dozen years
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 93. when i start running again along the east river i keep seeing planes diving toward me from the corner of my eye & panic
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 94. can’t stop thinking about the air toxicity which is a real thing but also a figure for the ambient fear gripping people.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 95. i visit the memorials in union square above the closed zone but i dont find them moving , just disturbing.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 96. its a historical genre , right ? the periods when the line blurs between the missing and the dead. i think about chile.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 97. people start to attack muslims , possible muslims taxi drivers shopkeepers people in turbans. srsly fuck the human spirit.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 98. some days at least. fiends go back to getting together , little dates , everything feels furtive , drinking starts at noon.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 99. it is a lost time. but the cds come out , delayed a week. tori , the blueprint. but the coup has its own special delay.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 100. bc the coup original cover shows them blowing up the wtc. that’s what they sent me back in june. pic.twitter.com/s70ytnjgon
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 19 , 2015
#howiquitspin 101. so the review is on the street saying the coup and i want you to throw a brick through the window of spin offices.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 102. but the cd is nowhere to be found bc they are having to print new covers and now finally it is time.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 103. it is time for me to go into the offices i have suggested get bricked & walk into the managing editor’s office and quit.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin end of chapter seven
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 104. i go into the spin offices. i sort of like the offices in the way you can if you have never had an office job.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 105. wave to the staffers i know in editorial. i don’t know anyone in advertising. i know a couple ppl in art , a flight down.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 106. one is daughter to a great poet ; weve had a couple conversations , shes told me some things. i dont see her this visit.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 107. after a min i go into glass - walled office of the managing editor. there r some things u should abt how i started at spin.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 108. the 1st spin staffers i met were a couple @ the time. they were visiting bay area. i had written sample column , thats it.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 109. i remember thinking how light - hearted + pleasant they were , i thought this specifically in comparison to the poets i knew
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 110. later i would understand this was the affect that goes with having a well - paid job in media biz. but it was nice.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 111. so that’s one thing. soon after that then - managing ed craig marks called to offer me my first contract.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 112. id never had a contract for anything. never bargained over pay , just took whatever the job offered.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 113. craig asked how much i wanted ; when i answered he laughed , sd “do you want a spin baseball cap w that ? ” laughed some more
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 114. it turned out i had asked for too little. he told me to ask for more. i did. he gave it to me. there was no baseball cap.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 115. four yrs later i walk into the managing ed’s office to quit but its not craig , he was deposed the year before or so.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 116. in fact it’s the woman fr that original couple i met. i think they had split up by then , not really sure. lets say yes.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 117. i liked her & was afraid of her , which i think was common ; u want that in a managing ed. the best thing i can say is…
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 118. she was a better writer than her ex , who wrote 1 great piece , under the byline jo jo dancer aka the gay rapper ,
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 119. now she had the office & there i was , after the coup review , after u2 , after flying paris>nyc , after 9/11 , trying to quit
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 120. it did not go well.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 121. ive been saying managing ed but it was *executive ed*—that explains all the glass.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 122. perhaps a self - fulfilling prophecy but it was exactly like breaking up. i have my reasons. they were rejected.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 123. i was told i was making a difference , that in thirty years people would read the words , not the ads that surrounded them.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 124. i remember thinking no one is reading any of this in 30 yrs. and thinking , the reviews are the ads anyway is my point.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 125. remade my case ; exec ed not having it. she wove btwn flattery & castigation. i did the thing one does in this situation.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 126. i said its not you its me.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 127. well , a version. i sd spin was great noble & good , it was my problem & i accepted all responsibility. she let me go.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 128. and that was the end of it. or so i thought. i was horribly mistaken.

#howiquitspin 129. on the way back to france the airport was odd. you’d expect “tense” or “scary” but mostly it seemed out of focus.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 130. i was certain i would be asked how i came to fly into nyc from overseas on 9/10. this seemed obvious. i prepped an answer
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 131. but no one asked. they just checked baggage emphatically. the shoe bomber hadnt gone down yet so we kept our shoes on.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 132. the last image i had of paris was from seeing band of outsiders at film forum. later i would write the dvd liner notes :

#howiquitspin 134. but the paris i got back to bore little resemblance to this. there was a strange inconsistency in people’s reactions.

#howiquitspin 136. on the one hand everybody wanted to hear my story , not story of how i quit spin but story of jets flying into buildings
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 137. on the other , people prided themselves on being unflappable and prepared. there was an amused + gentle chiding of the usa

#howiquitspin 138. for having no experience w terrorism and going all spastic. in paris everybody was all yep , bombs in the subway , etc.

#howiquitspin 139. in fact they had a protocol. by time i landed it had already been set in motion. it was called plan vigipirate. no really
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 140. citoyens ! it is important to be vigilant for pirates.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 141. plan vigipirate involved a lot of portable metal detectors at the entrances to civic buildings a/o tourist sites.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 142. but mostly plan vigipirate involves doing away w the public garbage cans. understand : paris had beautiful garbage cans.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 143. park green cylinders w details , stylish & compact & everywhere , one of best things abt paris. but easy to drop a bomb in
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 144. 1st thing that happens is the cans’ mouths are sealed over with brass discs. the whole city. the discs are beautiful too
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 145 and effectively its like a garbage strike. late sept 2001 the paris streets fill with trash. that’s plan vigipirate.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 146. it fills w trash so much that even late at night you can tell where people walk bc the trash is kicked to the side.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 147. negative space like a rachel whiteread sculpture , sort of clear where people go to & from work , trash everywhere else.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 148. so this is my life now. unemployed , counting my centimes , walking thru garbage in paris , recounting my nyc trip for wine.

#howiquitspin 153. i say it is that a story might include the most extraordinary grand & immiserating episodes personal & world - historical
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 154. and for all that it will end by having to go through the details of a contract , the pettiest thing humans have invented.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 155. imagine a play which is just the attorneys for creon , haemon , isme & antigone meeting for two hours. that is tragedy.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 156. my contract w spin , u will recall fr ch 1 , involves monthly pay for which i am to write a certain # of words per year.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 157. if u divide by 12 u can derive expected words per month in my 3 categories : features+reviews+columns. not rocket science.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 158. and reader i can assure you that as sept ends i am exactly on pace. a tiny bit ahead. on this there is no disagreement.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 159. yet spin , by which i mean the very exec ed who had so vigorously levied me to stay , says i owe them 16k or maybe 18k.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 160. lets recall that in 2015 dollars this is something like 2 million bucks. i mean if you are unemployed & broke anyway.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 161. i explain theyve made a mistake , i have completed the work expected of me. i offer to do 1 more column and a lead review.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 162. she sez u owe us 16k bc u still owe us x # of words. but even if that were true that would only account for half the 16k.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 163. they are double counting. they are charging me for both the words not yet written + pay for the remaining three months.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 164. this despite the fact i have not been paid for these months. i have been paid for what i have written and that’s all.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 165. i tell her i have a lawyer. this is not strictly true. i have a friend who used to be in salem 66 who has a law degree.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 20 , 2015
#howiquitspin 166. i am in misery and terror every second. i can’t bring myself to check my email. paris continues to fill with garbage.

#howiquitspin 171. i understand that i am not being punished for an incomplete contract , for some imagined value to the company.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 21 , 2015
#howiquitspin 172. i am being punished bc i was holier - than - thou , that i intimated some ideal that put my former colleagues in a bad light.
— pirate bae ( @bookofriot ) july 21 , 2015
#howiquitspin 173. as if i had come out & said spin was not a culture industry niche for witty phrasemaking music nerds but a marketing tool
