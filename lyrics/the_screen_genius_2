responsibilities• you are responsible for the quality of every annotation that you accept. 90% of de - editorings occur because the editor has been accepting sub - par annotations without editing. if you wouldn’t be comfortable having it be listed as your own annotation , don’t accept it ( or accept and edit if it's decent but needs work )
• don’t be afraid to edit annotations that are already accepted ! you should message the original author explaining why you edited it , but it’s hugely important that you aren’t afraid to touch a bad annotation just because it’s already been accepted
• seeing as screen genius is a small but growing community , you should be on the lookout for non - editors that express interest in tv/movies or show that they can annotate scripts reasonably well. if you don’t feel like coaching them yourself , pass the name along to me and i’ll work with them
• always be on the lookout for plagiarism. any annotation containing a straight copy/paste should immediately be rejected/deleted , and the user should be messaged. if you see a user that has never contributed to the site before writing flawless annotations , it doesn't hurt to copy and paste the text into the search bar
• there aren't too many screen genius editors , so it's important that you have a voice in the screen genius forum. new users aren't going to feel comfortable posting there if our top users won't even post there
• try your best to give credit to the real mvp's - - the script writers. as screen genius gears more towards getting writers verified so they can annotate their own scripts , it's important that we make screeng a place where they feel their work will be appreciated. this includes trying your best to find legitimate scripts rather than just copy/pasting dialogue , as well as showing love to the scripts that verified artists decide to share with us in the future. contact heisenferg , thescrivener , or beanhead if you're unsure whether or not a script is cool to upload
perks• for some of the bigger tags , it's harder to differentiate yourself from a sea of editors. but since screen genius is still in its early stages , becoming an editor ensures that you will be a major part of the community
• you don’t need anyone to accept your annotations anymore , or integrate your comments into the annotation. if you think something is worth adding , add it !
• you get more iq for making an annotation , and your upvotes are worth more
• you now have access to the genius editors forum. i’d recommend following it so you can stay up to date with what’s going on with the site
• yellow name !
