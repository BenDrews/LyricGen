it was all a dream
faith and big up in the limousine
back then wu - tang had dropped c.r.e.a.m
the source magazine was vital
i remember back then it was like the hip hop bible
nas got 5 mics so did brand nubian , tribe called quest , rakim , ice cube and them
and de la soul had a graceful flow they sampled hall & oats and made say no go
these memories are a thing of the past but i remember redman got a four and a half
masta ace got a three and a half , i start spazzing
i always thought his " slaughtahouse " album was a classic
just like das efx album , it was blasting
out every jeep and car that drove passing
onyx first album was purely engenius
your girl sucking on a next brother's penis
i remember , it was hard
times when my father didn't have a job
but music was still right there making me nod
so i reminisce over you , my god

adina howard , s - w - v
if you don't know , ask the next brother you see
sisters with voices , the other one is a freak
if you're my age and you don't know
then you're a geek
tha liks was drunk off o.e
i was pumping prince po , pharoahe monch and o.c
and common sense , before his goatee
just ice , nice & smooth and easy mo bee
jazzy joyce , sweet tee and special ed
when they play , " i got it made "
i can't keep a level head
the bricks will keep rocking
yes , yes , we'll keep rocking it
if you don't know what it is
put a sock in it
b - boys , working it out
but pop locking it
dropping it , the culture lives on
there's no stopping it
even when we pass on
they'll keep copping it
even when they start to charge more
they'll keep swapping it
2011 , pacewon jumps up on the scene
with his team and his partner , mr. green
even caramel sundaes are getting touched
scooped in my ice cream truck
i was a fiend before i became a teen
i worked this flow
now i'm a pro just like kurtis blow
and mr. green is like the grandmaster , flash
you never seen no hands faster
he reminds me of the grand wizzard , theodore
french vanilla chicks say " mi amore "
we are more like busta mixed with the arsonists
mixed with the ra , cash money & marvelous
mixed with run , the jungle brothers
and mixed with a little public enemy and souls of mischief
a little lords of underground , pun , in my mind
i used to turn back in the days way up in my ride
*scratching " my god " and " reminisce over you " *
