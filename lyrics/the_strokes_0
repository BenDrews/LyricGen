if we don't watch the sun
it will rise
if we don't take our time
it's not wise
putting posters up
for your band ( hey , we're playing if you wanna come by )
now i'll tear them down
with my hand
i didn't want to notice
didn't know the gun was loaded
didn't really know this
what kind of asshole drives a lotus ?
come here and go get with me
i wanna see you wednesday
come on , come on , come over
take it off your shoulder
come on and pull me over
we gotta get to work now
sliding it off your shoulder
as we're falling over
oh , welcome to japan !
scuba - dancing !
touchdown !
i didn't want to notice
didn't know the gun was loaded
didn't really know this
what kind of asshole drives a lotus ?
i didn't want to bore you
didn't wanna pick up your shit for ya
i've been ready to do this
i'll be there
come here and go get with me
i wanna see you wednesday
come on , come on , come over
take it off your shoulder
come on and pull me over
we gotta get to work now
sliding it off your shoulder
as we're falling over
you did it alone
you did it for fun
you did it for everyone who's on the run
you're not just a friend
you're me born again
we'll be in this race until the very end
he lives on the phone
he cheats on his clone
you'll never believe me 'til you're on your own
comes in once a month
and he never leaves
he said he is broken
yet he lives free
didn't wanna floor ya
i didn't wanna be there for ya
didn't wanna warn ya
i'll be there
