in many ways they'll miss the good old days
someday , someday
yeah , it hurts to say but i want you to stay
sometimes , sometimes
when we was young , oh man , did we have fun ?
always , always
promises , they break before they're made
sometimes , sometimes
oh , maya says i'm lacking in depth
i will do my best
you say you wanna stand by my side
darling , your head's not right
see , alone we stand , together we fall apart
yeah , i think i'll be alright
i'm working so i won't have to try so hard
tables , they turn sometimes
oh , someday
no , i ain't wasting no more time
( trying , trying )
and now my fears , they come to me in threes
so i sometimes
say , " fate , my friend , you say the strangest things i find
sometimes "
oh , maya says i'm lacking in depth
shit , i will try my best
you say you wanna stand by my side
darling , your head's not right
see , alone we stand , together we fall apart
yeah , i think i'll be alright
i'm working so i won't have to try so hard
tables , they turn sometimes
oh , someday
i ain't wasting no more time
