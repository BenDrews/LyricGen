they found our city under the water
gotta get my hands on something new
you don't want to be without this
something isn't adding up
decide my past
define my life
don't ask questions
'cause i don't know why
someone
didn't wanna know their name
drifting
you don't wanna know what's going down
even though i really like your place
somehow we don't have to know each other's name
they found our city under the water
i began to listen to your eyes
you don't want to live without it
leaving others in a bind
decide my past
define my life
don't ask questions
'cause i don't know why
someone
didn't wanna know their name
drifting
you don't wanna know what's going down
even though i really like your place
somehow we don't have to know each other's name
someone
i didn't wanna know their name
drifting
you don't wanna know what's going down
even though i really like your place
somehow we don't have to know each other's name
decide my past
define my life
don't ask questions
'cause i don't know why
i don't listen
and i don't speak
well , it's a talent
but i don't know why
