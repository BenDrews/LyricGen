i waited for ya
i waited for ya
i waited on ya
but now i don't
you didn't see it
i didn't see it
i didn't see it
but now , oh , i do
i play your game
i play your game
now
i play your game
i play your game
i take my chances alone
get on your horse and be gone
i will not wait up for you anymore
so you can ask me if something is wrong
will you go ?
i don't know anymore
when the night isn't ready for you
it's a fleeting unorthodox view
they invited a stewardess , too
now they want you to see it
here's to days he decides he's got time
and he claims that it's not a surprise
when he finds out the truth's on his side
i take my chances alone
get on your horse and be gone
i will not wait up for you anymore
so you can ask me if something is wrong
will you go ?
i don't know anymore
i don't believe anyone
as they crawl out of my way
waiting for the night
leaving night by night
you can see me travel
we could be in trouble every night
we're having a new life
