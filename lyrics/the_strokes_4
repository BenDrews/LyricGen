close the door
not all the way
he don’t understand
we don’t understand
so don’t you wanna remind me
i don’t know a thing
and some of us remember
and some run out of place
can i waste all your time here on the sidewalk ?
can i stand in your light just for a while ?
i’ve waited around to wait in a room
i made up more time watchin’ you
you got it down now , don’t you ?
i wanted to understand your face
so don’t you wanna remind me
i don’t know a thing
and some of us remember
and some run out of place
can i waste all your time here on the sidewalk ?
can i stand in your light just for a while ?
i’ve waited around to wait in a room
i made up more time watchin’ you
i needed someone
i needed someone
