one two , three
get dressed in your bed
while she's asleep
it isn’t right
but it isn’t hard
tell me tell me won’t you understand
show me show me show me a better plan
it’s summer lies
it's someone else's nothing
here it comes now
you asked me to stay
you asked me to stay
you asked me to stay
but there’s a million reasons to leave
find a job
find a friend
find a home
find a dog
settle down
out of town
find a dream
shut it down
please please don’t point it that way
it’s just a trigger that goes once
and you’ll be unafraid
i wish that i'd been noticed but it never goes that way
the silence that you brought has
gone , gone , gone
tell me , tell me , won’t you understand ?
show me , show me , show me
you asked me to stay
you asked me to stay
you asked me to stay
but there’s a million reasons to leave
show me what to say
show me what to be
show me what to see
show me what to be
find a job
find a friend
find a home
find a dog
settle down
out of town
find a dream
shut it down
i don’t wanna be in there with you
i don't wanna be in there without your loving either
i waited for your thoughts
can't wait no longer
