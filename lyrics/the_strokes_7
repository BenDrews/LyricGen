he seemed impressed by the way you came in
" tell us a story , i know you're not boring "
i was afraid that you would not insist
" you sound so sleepy , just take this , now leave me "
i said , please don't slow me down if i'm going too fast
you're in a strange part of our town
yeah , the night's not over , you're not trying hard enough
our lives are changing lanes , you ran me off the road
the wait is over , i'm now taking over
you're no longer laughing , i'm not drowning fast enough
now every time that i look at myself
" i thought i told you , this world is not for you "
the room is on fire as she's fixing her hair
" you sound so angry , just calm down , you found me "
i said please don't slow me down if i'm going too fast
you're in a strange part of our town
yeah , the night's not over , you're not trying hard enough
our lives are changing lanes , you ran me off the road
the wait is over , i'm now taking over
you're no longer laughing , i'm not drowning fast enough
