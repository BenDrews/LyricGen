say it all
just get it all off your chest
shake it up
500 , 000 times
say no more
we don't believe anything
teenage angst
come all ages
baby , show me where to go
some things i don't wanna know
baby , tell me if you're sure
out all the time
say it all
i'm not awake anymore
change my mind
2 , 000 times before
seen a knight
dance on the side of the road
teenage angst
come all ages
baby , show me where to go
some things i don't wanna know
baby , tell me if you're sure
out all the time
feeling dizzy now
in the running show
all i want to see
all i want to know
watch you as you stay
faces at your door
waiting for your piece
pull the trigger please
baby , show me where to go
somethings i don't wanna know
baby , tell me if you're sure
out all the time
cause i don't wanna see everybody get together
leave these dreams alone
you don't wanna have to tell me that i wanted you go
everybody needs a shadow , oh
