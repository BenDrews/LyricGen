was an honest man
asked me for the phone , tried to take control
oh , i don't see it that way
i don't see it that way
we shared some ideas
all obsessed with fame , says we're all the same
oh , i don't see it that way
i don't see it that way
raised in carolina , i'm not like that
trying to remind her when we go back
i missed the last bus , i'll take the next train
i'll try , but you see , it's hard to explain
i say the right thing but act the wrong way
i like it right here but i cannot stay
i'm watching tv , forget what i'm told
well , i am too young and they are too old
the joke is on you , this place is a zoo
you're right , it's true
he said he can't decide
i shake my head to say , " everything's just great "
oh , i just can't remember
i just can't remember
raised in carolina , she says , " i'm not like that "
trying to remind her when we go back
i say the right thing but act the wrong way
i like it right here but i cannot stay
i'm watching tv , forget what i'm told
well , i am too young and they are too old
oh , man , can't you see i'm nervous ?
so please pretend to be nice so i can be mean
i missed the last bus , we'll take the next train
i'll try , but you see , it's hard to explain
