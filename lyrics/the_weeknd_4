recommend play my song on the radio
you too busy trying to find that blue - eyed soul
i let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
and i swear too much on the regular
we gone let them hits fly , we gone let it go
if it ain't xo then it gotta go
i just won a new award for a kids show
talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
i'm like , goddamn , bitch , i am not a teen choice
goddamn , bitch , i am not a bleach boy
whip game , make a nigga understand though
got that hannibal , silence of the lambo
hit the gas so hard make it rotate
all my niggas blew up like a propane
all these r&b niggas be so lame
got a sweet asian chick , she go lo mein
you know me , you know man , you know me
every time you try to forget who i am
i'll be right there to remind you again
you know me ( pow ! pow ! ) , you know me
said i'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
faded off a double cup , i'm mixing up the potion
all i wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
it just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
everybody knows it , all these niggas know me
platinum off a mixtape , sipping on that codeine
pour it in my trophies , roll until my nose bleed
i'ma keep on singing while i'm burning up that og
all my niggas get it they make money all alone
rock a chain around they neck , making sure i'm getting home
when i travel 'round the globe , make a couple mil' a show
and i come back to my city , i fuck every girl i know
used to walk around with a slouch , had a mattress on the floor
now my shit straight
eating all day , tryna lose weight
that good sex , we'll sweat it out
hotel bed springs , we'll wear it out
i ain't gotta tell you 'cause
you know me , you know me
you know man , you know me
every time you try to forget who i am
i'll be right there to remind you again
you know me ( pow ! pow ! ) , you know me
why don't you shake some , shake somethin'
for the don ? don't you break nothin' , break nothin'
baby girl , won't you work some , work somethin'
for the don ? don't you hurt nothin' , hurt nothin'
big girl , won't you shake some , shake somethin'
for the don ? don't you break nothin' , break nothin'
baby girl , won't you work some , work somethin'
for the don ? don't you hurt nothin' , hurt nothin'
'cause you know me , they know me
you ain't know me , yet you know me
