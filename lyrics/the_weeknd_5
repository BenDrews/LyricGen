i left my girl back home
i don't love her no more
and she'll never fucking know that
these fucking eyes that i'm staring at
let me see that ass
look at all this cash
and i emptied out my cards , too
now i'm fucking leaning on that
bring your love , baby , i could bring my shame
bring the drugs , baby , i could bring my pain
i got my heart right here
i got my scars right here
bring the cups , baby , i could bring the drank
bring your body , baby , i could bring you fame
and that's my motherfucking words , too
just let me motherfucking love you
listen , ma , i'll give you all i got
get me off of this , i need confidence in myself
listen , ma , i'll give you all of me
give me all of it , i need all of it to myself
so tell me you love me
( only for tonight , only for tonight )
even though you don't love me
just tell me you love me
( i'll give you what i need , i'll give you all of me )
even though you don't love me
let me see you dance
i love to watch you dance
take you down another level
get you dancing with the devil
take a shot of this
but i'm warning you
i'm on that shit that you can't smell , baby
so , put down your perfume
bring your love , baby , i could bring my shame
bring the drugs , baby , i could bring my pain
i got my heart right here
i got my scars right here
bring the cups , baby , i could bring the drank
bring your body , baby , i could bring you fame
and that's my motherfucking words , too
so let me motherfucking love you
listen , ma , i'll give you all i got
get me off of this , i need confidence in myself
listen , ma , i'll give you all of me
give me all of it , i need all of it to myself
so tell me you love me
( only for tonight , only for tonight )
even though you don't love me
just tell me you love me
( i'll give you what i need , i'll give you all of me )
even though you don't love me
