we are not the same , i am too reckless
i'm not tryna go in that direction
these niggas , they been doin' too much flexin'
and they about to call the wrong attention
and i don't got no patience , no more testin'
i do shit how i want , don't need no blessin'
xo niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
nobody stoppin' us , oh no , we destined
and everybody 'round you is so basic
i'm never rockin' white , i'm like a racist
i don't drink my liquor with a chase in
that money is the only thing i'm chasin'
and some dope dimes on some coke lines
gimme head all night , cum four times
baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
do an ounce , get some dick

and everybody fuckin' , everybody fuckin'
pussy on the house , everybody fuckin'
man , i miss my city , man , it's been a minute

i'm just tryna live life through a new lens
drivin' by the streets i used to walk through

she tried to take a selfie at my grandma's funeral
used to roam on queen , now i sing queen street anthems
used to hate attention , now i pull up in that wagon
and i was broken , i was broken , i was so broke
i used to roam around the town when i was homeless
me and lamar would rob a nigga for his jordans
and flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
now we get faded when we want , girl , we got choices
lay them on the fuckin' table , we got choices
and if they wanna fuck my niggas , they got choices
they told me not to fall in love , that shit is pointless

they told me not to fall in love , that shit is pointless
