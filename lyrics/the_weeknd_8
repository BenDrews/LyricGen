laisse tomber les filles
un jour c’est toi qu’on laissera
laisse tomber les filles
laisse tomber les filles
un jour c’est toi qu’on laissera
oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour - là
non , je ne pleurerai pas
non , je ne pleurerai pas
oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour - là
je ne pleurerai pas
je ne pleurerai pas
i guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
girl , you could have had me doing anything you pleased
girl , you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
'cuz i'm not as hard as i make it seem to be
it could have went so many ways
so many ways it can go
'cuz ain't nobody feels the way that i feel when i’m alone
so if i said that i won't call
the lying comes natural to me
you probably could have had it all
you could have been that lonely star
if we just went on
if we just went on
if we just went on
if we just went on
happiness exists when you don't know a thing
so i hope you don't think this song is about you
and only i can know how close you came
but baby i'm a pro at letting go
i love it when they come and go
it could have went so many ways
so many ways it can go
'cuz ain't nobody feels the way that i feel when i’m alone
so if i said that i won't call
the lying comes natural to me
you probably could have had it all
you could have been that lonely star
if we just went on
if we just went on
if we just went on
if we just went on
if we just went on
if we just went on
if we just went on
if we just went on
