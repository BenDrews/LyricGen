light reflects from your shadow
it is more than i thought could exist
you move through the room
like breathing was easy
if someone believed me
they would be
as in love with you as i am
they would be
as in love with you as i am
they would be
as in love with you as i am
they would be
in love , love , love
and everyday
i am learning about you
the things that no one else sees
and the end comes too soon
like dreaming of angels
and leaving without them
and leaving without them
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love , love , love
love , love , love
love , love , love
and with words unspoken
a silent devotion
i know you know what i mean
and the end is unknown
but i think i'm ready
as long as you're with me
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love with you as i am
being
as in love , love , love
