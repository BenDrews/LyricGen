i saw you again , it felt like we had never met
it's like the sun set in your eyes and never wanted to rise
and what have you done with the one i love ?
when i look into your eyes , i see no surprise
i always thought it was sad
the way we act like strangers
after all that we had
we act like we had never met
we make believe , i've never seen your face , you neither me
you catch my eye , i'll register a smile
you were more than just a friend , oh the feeling
it never came to an ending , i can't bear to see you
i always thought it was a shame
that we have to play these games
it felt like you really knew me
now it feels like you see through me
when i see you again
i'll know not to expect
stay one step away
we won't have to wait
when i see you again
and i'm greeted as a friend
it is understood
that we did all we could
i always thought it was sad
the way we act like strangers
after all that we had
we act like we had never met
i always thought it was a shame
that we have to play these games
it felt like you really knew me
now it feels like you see through me
