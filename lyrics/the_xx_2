i watched you breathe in
and i wished you'd stop
only for long enough
long enough
it's
hard
to
say
separate or combine
i ask you one last time
did i hold you too tight ?
did i not let enough light in ?
if a feeling appears
if your mind should sway
it's not a secret you should keep
i won't let you slip away
we used to be closer than this
we used to be closer than this
we used to get closer than this
is it something you miss ?
we used to be closer than this
we used to be closer than this
we used to get closer than this
is it something you miss ?
winged or chained
i ask you would you have stayed
did i hold you too tight ?
did i not let enough light in ?
