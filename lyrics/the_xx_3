i don't blame you
we got carried away
i can't hold on
to an empty space
now you've found a new star to orbit
it could be love
i think you're too soon to call us old
when and where did we go cold ?
i thought i had you on hold
and every time i let you leave
i always saw you coming back to me
when and where did we go cold ?
i thought i had you on hold
where does it stop , where does it stop
where do you dare me to ( draw the line ) ?
you've got the body , you've got the body
dare me to , dare me to
where does it stop , where does it stop
where do you dare me to ( draw the line ) ?
you've got the body , you've got the body
you've got the body , you've got the body
i thought i had you on hold
where does it stop , where does it stop
where do you dare me to ( draw the line ) ?
you've got the body , you've got the body
dare me to , dare me to
where does it stop , where does it stop
where do you dare me to ( draw the line ) ?
you've got the body , you've got the body
dare me to , dare me to
my young heart chose to believe
we were destined
young hearts
all need love
call it a lesson
the stars and the charts
and the cards make sense
only when we want them to
when i lie awake staring in to space
i see a different view
now you've found a new star to orbit
it could be love
i think you're too soon to call us old
when and where did we go cold ?
i thought i had you on hold
and every time i let you leave
i always saw you coming back to me
when and where did we go cold ?
i thought i had you on hold
i thought i had you on hold
i thought i had you on hold
where does it stop , where does it stop
where do you dare me to ( draw the line ) ?
you've got the body , you've got the body
dare me to , dare me to
where does it stop , where does it stop
where do you dare me to ( draw the line ) ?
you've got the body , you've got the body
you've got the body , you've got the body
where does it stop , where does it stop
where do you dare me to ( draw the line ) ?
you've got the body , you've got the body
dare me to , dare me to
where does it stop , where does it stop
where do you dare me to ( draw the line ) ?
you've got the body , you've got the body
dare me to , dare me to
and every time i let you leave
i always saw you coming back to me
when and where did we go cold ?
i thought i had you on hold
i thought i had you on hold
i thought i had you on hold
