fiction when we're not together
mistaken for a vision , something of my own creation
i wake up alone , with only daylight between us
last night the world was beneath us , tonight comes , dear love
we'll be torn apart by the break of day
you're more than i can believe
would ever come my way
fiction when we're not together
mistaken for a vision , something of my own creation
come real love , why do i refuse you ?
cause if my fear's right , i risk to lose you
and if i just mind and wake up alone
bring on the night
fiction when we're not together
mistaken for a vision , something of my own creation
and it's certainly how am i to tell ?
i know your face all too well , still i wake up alone
fiction when we're not together
