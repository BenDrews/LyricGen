all i have , i will give to you
in dark times when no one wants to
i will give you me
and we'll be
us
all i have , i will give to you
in dark times when no one wants to
i will give you me
and we'll be
us
and there's no one else
who knows me
like you do
all i've done , you've done too
the walls i
hide behind
you walk through
you just walk through
well i know all the words
to take you apart
you know i know you're hurt
i want to mend your heart
you're broke down
why don't you tell me from the start
you know i know you're hurt
i want to mend your heart
and there's no one else
who knows me
like you do
what i've done
you've done too
the walls i
hide behind
you walk through
you just walk through
