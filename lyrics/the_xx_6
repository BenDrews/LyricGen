my heart is beating
in a different way
been gone such a long time
i don't feel the same
my heart is beating
in a different way
been gone such a long time
will you miss me
( how did i , how did i how did i , oh )
when there's nothing to see ?
( how did i , how did i how did i , oh )
tell me , how did this come to be ?
( how did i , how did i how did i , oh )
and now there's no hope for you and me
my heart is beating
in a different way
been gone such a long time
i don't feel the same
my heart is beating
in a different way
been gone such a long time
do you still believe
( ahh , ahh , ahh , oh )
in you and me ?
( ahh , ahh , ahh , oh )
are we all we could be ?
( ahh , ahh , ahh , oh )
is it meant to be ?
my heart is beating
in a different way
been gone such a long time
i don't feel the same
my heart is beating
in a different way
been gone such a long time
my heart is beating
in a different way
been gone such a long time
