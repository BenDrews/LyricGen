we visit a life we both left behind
we know the heart
move to the ever - moving
or , blazin' , we go over
and over and over and over again
if i wait too long , i lose you from my sight
maybe tonight
i could stop dreaming
and start believing in forever
and ever and ever and ever again
reunion , reunion
reunion , reunion
never not ever , never not ever again
and it's burning inside 'til you give it up
how long should i wait ?
there's no need to hide , i let
only you in here
there's an end to us with someone else inside
you shine your light
there goes that feeling , won't let me see them
never not ever , never not ever again
did i see you see me in a new light ?
did i see you see me in a new light ?
did i see you see me in a new light ?
never not ever again
did i ( never not ever ) see you ( never again )
see me ( never not ever ) in a new light ? ( never not ever again )
did i see you see me ?
never not ever , never not ever again
