you leave with the tide
and i can't stop you leaving
i can see it in your eyes
some things have lost their meaning
( devote ) to me
alone ( with me )
say with me
" why would you ever want to leave ? "
you leave with the tide
and i can't stop you leaving
i can see it in your eyes
some things have lost their meaning
fade out of view
i wouldn't do that to you
i wouldn't just leave us alone
when we could be close , close , close
hold me close
when you could leave us alone
why would you just leave us alone
when we have been close , close
you leave with the tide
and i can't stop you leaving
i can see it in your eyes
some things have lost their meaning
you leave with the tide
and i can't stop you leaving
i can see it in your eyes
some things have lost their meaning
