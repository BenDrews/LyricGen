it's time to live it up , oh
you get sent the fine wine deliverables and chocolate candles
it's time to live it up , oh
horse and carrots , ride round the villas and rock chinchillas
girl i ain't going nowhere , sit here and play cops and robbers down by the moonlight
sunrise it's time to go , grab your phone take some pictures
love in modern time
if we just go for a ride
speed of light ignoring the signs
i'll race you to st. harvest way
it's time to live it up , oh
you get sent the fine wine deliverables and chocolate candles
its time to live it up , oh
matching shiny shoes dressed like thriller and watch godzilla
its a lovely sunday , sit here and crack a big ole lobster , shrimp and pasta
i seen your face when i call , grab you phone change your status
love in modern time
