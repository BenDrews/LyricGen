i'm pagin' aroma , pagin' sada
had lil' poom - poom , she called me dada
kiss the poom - poom , so oochie - walla
praise the fatha , praise the fatha , praise !
jenna , lisa , frita
and i'll just sit in the back of the bimmer
puffin' the lala , smokin' the reefer
hb shotgun rollin' the keisha
i got a camera in , boo , but we lay low
we had our first kiss near the equator
and mama - se mama - sa , mama say so
and this thing may never get a day old
back in paris with alice for dinner
smokin' the cuban , boy keep ya chin up
girl in the blue dress look like a winner
caught my eye in the back of the mirror
you know i got to show love , show love
show love , show love
you know i got to show love , show love
show love , show love
you know i got to show love
one hour later , i had to praise her
cruise head to spain , i think i'm vega
any flavor , every summer
me and brodinski bringin' the numbers
groovin' to salsa with eda
hop on the mdma , feeling better
said that her favorite car was a jetta
sent me some champagne all with a letter
made me say musa , musa , musa
i want to go down to st. lucia
got brianna , bought for two
scenery , boy it's all for you , hey !
i'ma reveal her , bump and feel her
boys , gangsters , touch with the razors
diamente velvet laces
the girl needs savin' , boy go save her
you know i got to show love , show love
show love , show love
you know i got to show love , show love
show love , show love
you know i got to show love
all the day , show love
every day show love
what you say , show love
all the day , show love
you know i got to show love , show love
show love , show love
you know i got to show love , show love
show love , show love
you know i got to show love
