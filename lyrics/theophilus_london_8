i had a wonderful time here
sincere , back in the hum drum
she picks the feeling when i'm near
she hears heckles and the hum hum
and night winds blew , night winds blew
past tense , waiting on the sun sun
back in the days , you followed your heart
and tell me when to go , and tell me when to start
i'll be back for you before the summer parts
i'll be back , back before the summer parts
became insecure with your body parts
until the night came , we took it all apart
and night winds blew , night winds blew
past tense , waiting on the sun to start
rise up , wise up , time's up ( time's up )
i want to thank you , heavenly father
for shining your light on me
you sent me someone who really loves me
and not just my body
he keeps me happy
so very happy and loves me
i don't know how to be
it's been a long time since i had someone who loves me
i owe my thanks to thee
i know it cannot happen without your love
oooh , without your love
i think holiday sweaters
somehow just make the holiday better
the sun's out , it's christmas
that means we in aussie , saucy
is that an old benz ? well that's bossy
all my old friends , they lost me
somehow when you get bigger in the limelight
and they start playing some crossover on our right
forget what they say this is our night
i need you , baby blue , like {guitar fight ? }
where's duke ? i hope you don't puke
the limo looks clean , the wine's the fruit
the lines , the hook , the dope , the book
your ten inch heels , the flair , the look
the glare in her eyes , she's innocent
you're acting too belligerent
i want to thank you , heavenly father
for shining your light on me
you sent me someone who really loves me
and not just my body
he keeps me happy
so very happy and loves me
