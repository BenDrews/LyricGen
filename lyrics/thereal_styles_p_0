uh
inhale this , clench your fist
then ya , feel the mist through the uterus
can ya , picture this ?
life without me ? wake up , you're having bad dreams
cause ya fiend for a toke
my crew tote tocques and mink coats
on the cell with the boat
what you thought , get caught , get bailed out ?
fuck the jailhouse , hennessey on the rocks
is all we got as we sail out , entrepeneurs
cristal pourer , be glad we ain't takin' yours
boring huh ? i'm warnin' ya
style waits for no bitch , i dream rich
when i fuck with scratch and sniff
now i stacks the shit , and practice it
so no bitch can tax the shit , miraculous
so i can relax a bit , and get my dick licked
drugs , baby
haha
need a little something that can take me there
to a place that i can get away from
my feelings so far away
somewhere with my head up in the clouds
suddenly it doesn't feel so loud
so far , away , somewhere
i got 'em
ayo , platinum choker , heavy smoker
the gun toter , barrack obam' supporter
recently hillary voter
smoking loud way up in the cloud
disappearing in my thoughts
disappearing from courts
yao ming face , eyes chinky
kush got my breath stinky
50 thousand large shine on my pinky
women lust me , they say i'm too ghetto
they can't trust me , my timeline be filled with his bitch
he wanna bust me , mira mira talk
coca cola deals , big scales
doing different shit , alaska
snapchatting at wheels donnie
my prognosis is atrocious out the black wraith
fly shit , never down , i stay with some faith
ahh
need a little something that can take me there
to a place that i can get away from
my feelings so far away
somewhere with my head up in the clouds
suddenly it doesn't feel so loud
so far , away , somewhere
dreamt of ferraris and ferragamos
raised on the streets , and married the marijuana
told the joint terminate my thoughts like sarah conner
but it couldn't , but i smoked with big , a badge of honor
and faith , what's fate ?
light and 8th and i'm straight
that's the morning
but i'mma need a zip when it's late
i used to sit on the crate
but now i dip in the seats
of the cherokee
the therapy's a spliff to the face ( huh ? )
i'm from the strain gang and the mean team
cut the lights , turn the beat on , let the pain bang
light the joint , the escape route
you heard it from the ghost
but you should it hear it from faith now
need a little something that can take me there
to a place that i can get away from
my feelings so far away
somewhere with my head up in the clouds
suddenly it doesn't feel so loud
so far , away , somewhere
ayo big , we got it
we gon' hold baby - girl down , man
ay , ay , ay
talk now baby
