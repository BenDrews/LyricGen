everyday i wake up , i swear to god i wanna lay a ni##a
can't trust a soul your close friend will betray a ni##a
get you 25 years or fu#k around and spray a ni##a
tell em what you sayin ni##a
don't play the game if you can't be a player ni##a
just can't provoke all this coke that they weighin ni##a
listen what i'm sayin ni##a
if your caught don't talk in the courts
just go and hit the bar like the hulk , green man
they gotta take one for the team and this
situation sticky like semen , without a bi#ch to lick it off
you need a lawyer that could pick it off
find the witnesses , fu#k it i'ma hit em off
i'm a m.o.b.s.t.e.r
four door car or somethin that revolve
we can talk business , or we can talk the businesss
and takin out ya bodies cause real ni##as live this
and boy you just makin up bars
i spit where i live , how i live and why i'm so hard
we all got rap sheets
but i'm the one to make ni##as run
like the guy with the gun at the track ?
call me g host
used to sell p dope
watch out for pachengo if you wanna be carlito
i got big knives , i got big guns
old school sh#t , want some come get some
