fa , fa - fa - fabulous {*scratched : " king tee*}
all aboard the mothership , prepare to set sail
lyrics fat , swell as a killer whale
enemies approachin , identify yourself
they're raisin up the flag , backin up they get to blast
open fire , cannons let loose
shut 'em down like the spruce goose
captain aye aye , they still floatin
give the order - blow they punk ass out the ocean , got 'em
drink hit the dank as they sink to the bottom
schools of sharks circles then the sea turned all purple
even jacques costeau punk - ass was scared to go
and that just goes to show to uhh , let you know , uhh
as i chill again like gilligan and the skipper
a nigga kickin it with two hoes like jack tripper
swabbin the deck , just stabbin in my cabin
rubbed the magic lamp and out popped aladdin like " what's happenin ? "
i said , " what's up ? i want my rhymes to be the dopest
ala.. cadabara.. hocus pocus
you think they can see me ? " he said , " nope not really
cause the fog's in the air plus you're way out there "
when you look up in the sky , ohh me oh my
it's a bird , it's a plane , it's a god damn shame
tela come wicked and you best beware
you will see when he kick it that he's way out there
my style pattern's unique , exquisite , so come visit
exhibit a through g , through z , e - n - t
stuck your equilibrium on activate
captivate the ear and then his eyesockets upon my pockets
i left him in suspense , who's the , tribes and crews ?
competition none exists bitches be blowin me kisses
others fall like missiles , the cap was artificially flavored
my first verse , it quenched your thirst
for instance , i'm makin people boogie but yet
from long distance , causin it to interfere with your hemisphere
flee , it's a g recipe
it get you hooked , havin fits off my shit
they wanna wipe us out ! i think they hate us
killers with the pencils and the papers and erasers
i'm comin through ya living room boom , shok - a - lok - a boom
shake ya whole area , break your sound barrier
so wake up if you sleep cause like a clock i tock i'm tickin
early bird , get the worm , and i stopped slangin chickens
but i still be kickin facts , black , black on black crime
why the hell you jackin me ? i don't have a damn dime
my skills kill you like a deer with my spear
when it rains it pours he fell from the tier off the third floor
the pieces of the puzzle huh , figure it out
and start fuckin around and we'll be diggin you out
and it's just that simple put the thang up to your temple
and now you got a permanent dimple
it's king , tee , the name nigga and don't get snotty
better knock on some doors and ask somebody ( yeah )
so fuck that other shit and grab my hand with all your might
cause i'mma show you what that west coast like
the flavor's unbelievable , nutritious , delicious
nigga when the tee get loose it gets vicious
let's give it up for the fabulous {* " king tee " *}
