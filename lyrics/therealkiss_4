one , only one , will run 'em , hitsquad , i go
mom told me to be fervent , but i was born to be salient
family talks are deficient , so with hard life i ain't patient
policies all restrictive and devotion i got preventive
that a nigga won't stop with that hustle , they ran into me why they shuffle
still rummaging around in my bags , maybe , i'll find that key between your legs
i gotta win with a laughable ease
ask my bro if a day i'll cease
my fingers to the bones 'till you call the police
go to hell with neverland and your heroin alice
our sisters in the club who will feed them kids
if i know who got'em pregnant put 'em in my wrong deeds
i got myself invited along that trip to hell
keep the secrets of the streets you ain't gotta tell
you know i ain't got the upbringing of late kate chopin
i'm a bad guy funny like charlie chaplin
i gotta take it to extremes
anyway put me in fast streams
your gang my gun is sending to you imbecile some beams
my baby , my baby , my gang is my baby
a streetwise that nigga , i'm reppin' my city
ain't dealing with you gay , my freedom is sturdy
wish me happy birthday , i'm walking the streets for my baby
my baby , my baby , my gang is my baby
a streetwise that nigga i'm reppin' my city
ain't dealing with you gay , my freedom is sturdy
wish me happy birthday , i'm walking the streets for my baby
streets are paved with gold , my cd's there all got sold
i stretch a point i'm looking for fame
don't throw me your coin i ain't a lame
my success won't hinge upon media
my support will go right to syria
to live i need surfeit of knowledge , i'm sitting with my gang in college
they rush out an item for my technics , each single i foretold had some leaks
inveigh against me i don't care , my gang is engaged in warfare
inflation nibbles away at spending power , meanwhile fake dope dealers are taking a powder
congrats if you know it's a poxy , those rappers their lost is gusty
i'm hacked off i'm taking some breaks but like hacking cough always making some clicks
fanatics i'm having their ears , those haters i threat 'em like steers
my fingers in the 'till untiring
i meet you in my way that's firing
my baby , my baby , my gang is my baby
a streetwise that nigga i'm reppin' my city
ain't dealing with you gay , my freedom is sturdy
wish me happy birthday , i'm walking the streets for my baby
my baby , my baby , my gang is my baby
a streetwise that nigga i'm reppin' my city
ain't dealing with you gay , my freedom is sturdy
wish me happy birthday , i'm walking the streets for my baby
i'm b.e.s.t that's the truth
i wish you put on waterproof
snap to it or lay on the couch
i'm riding allow me to push
the top of the hill that's my prey but you're putting limits like a spray
my baby , my baby , my gang is my baby
a streetwise that nigga i'm reppin' my city
ain't dealing with you gay , my freedom is sturdy
wish me happy birthday , i'm walking the streets for my baby
my baby , my baby , my gang is my baby
a streetwise that nigga i'm reppin' my city
ain't dealing with you gay , my freedom is sturdy
wish me happy birthday , i'm walking the streets for my baby
hitsquad..........
