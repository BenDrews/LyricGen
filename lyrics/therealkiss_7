it's been a year now since i saw your face here to
i want you here to
make me smile it's
been awhile since we last spoke you broke
my heart in several pieces you should know
i loved you i would've done anything for
you i'd even take a bullet that's how
much i care you were everything you
were my world if you only knew
how i feel i beg & i plead but
i guess we were never meant to be
i'm missing you
i'm missing you
i'm missing you
i'm missing you
i texted you the other day you didn't text
back i hate the fact that we're apart now
i'm falling apart i'm lost without you the
other night i got a dream about the two of us
being together but now i know that's too good
to be true but i'm still missing you
i'm missing you
i'm missing you
i'm missing you
i'm missing you
