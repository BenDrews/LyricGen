gotta be sick of this guy
pull up , skrr , get in the ride
left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
light up a spliff and get high

lookin' at you i'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
play this song for him , tell him , " just listen "

girl , said he keeps on playin' games
and his lovin' ain't the same
