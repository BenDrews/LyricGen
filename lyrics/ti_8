just stop your crying , it's a sign of the times
welcome to the final show
hope you're wearing your best clothes
you can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
you look pretty good down here
but you ain't really good
we never learn , we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets ? the bullets ?
we never learn , we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets ? the bullets ?
just stop your crying , it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
just stop your crying , it'll be alright
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from here
just stop your crying , have the time of your life
breaking through the atmosphere
and things are pretty good from here
remember everything will be alright
we can meet again somewhere
somewhere far away from here
we never learn , we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets ? the bullets ?
we never learn , we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets ? the bullets ?
just stop your crying , it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
stop your crying , baby , it'll be alright
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from here
we never learn , we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets ? the bullets ?
we never learn , we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets ? the bullets ?
we don't talk enough , we should open up
before it's all too much
will we ever learn ? we've been here before
it's just what we know
stop your crying , baby , it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away , we got to get away
we got to get away , we got to get away
we got to get away
we got to , we got to run
we got to , we got to run
we got to , we got to run
