i'm just like a regular girl
all i wanna do is be heard baby
and i know you like to fuck a lot
so after we get done , before sleep
i want you to listen to me
you know you're just a backup
and i'm just fuckin' with ya
until i can get back up
you heard i had a man
but then we broke up
so if you try to leave
you're not the only one i've heard of ( i'll be good )
i'll go to clubs
fall in love with strippers
i know they just workin'
i know they workin' hard
they tryin' to get by
tryin' to get paid
tryin' to get the money
but i'm tryin' to get laid motherfucker
i'm not well ( no i'm not well )
no i'm not myself ( no i'm not myself )
i'm not healthy , i don't want you to help me
i don't want your help
i think i fell in love , like in a week
think his name was bobby , maybe it was steve
or maybe it was joe , or ricky
maybe it was martin , maybe it was nikki
i often go to clubs
fall in love with niggas
i know they just flirtin' ( i know they flirtin' )
they try to get the ass
try to get laid
try to get my number
but they 'bout to get played , motherfucker
