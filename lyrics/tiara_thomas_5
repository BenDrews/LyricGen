i been all around the world
came from the bottom , aiming for the top
and i'm still climbing
say what you wanna but
i'm not coming down
i been all around the world
i still got haters
blacktop shades
you came blazin'
baby heading down a cloud
i'm on my pedestal
yeah i said it ho
fuck whoever said the rap game wasn't edible man
i'm incredible homie i been beasting
i be murdering bars
y'all leave bee stings
sippin' bitches what lemonade
i ain't even made it
you already afraid
you already are caged
you fucking lab rabbits
you was hot for a season
little industry gadgets
you scatterbrains
so much to say a scrabble game
but habits have changed and i've been trying to change mine all the way
but i feel my transformation gon' smash the entire game
my brothers alone said fuck your entire
name , and your entire
fame , what you know about it
i take the title from ya'
what you gon' do about it
you're emotional bitch , fuck your period
your reign of glory , your balls wetter ending the sentences
hate me if you want to but always remember this
that i'm the future of this game , and of course i spit this shit
i'm not a but i'm the bitch
mc hammer too legit
and more than confident
anybody ever doubted me
coming back with this shit bitch
i been all around the world
came from the bottom , aiming for the top
and i'm still climbing
say what you wanna but
i'm not coming down
i been all around the world
i still got haters
blacktop shades
you came blazin'
baby heading down a cloud
who got the flow ?
its somethin like manute bol
blowin' fluke horns , i'm not high
bitch i'm four wings , i'm two flies , i'm net fly
i ain't with that hoopla , dolo and the coopers
i maneuver the two - cloud smokin' like i'm supposed to
flowin' like i'm in poker , you neverï»¿ know my emotion
never will you survive if you ever rhyme for a poser
i just light up and focus
i just ride for the coaches
i just ride for my niggas and give the bitches the business
callin' these bitches cuz bitches ain't even women
yeah
we been all around the world
you gon' know a lot of haters when you know a lot of girls
i know a lot of money bring a whole lot of vultures
that's why a little more bring a whole lot of toasters
cooler system on it
pray you never use it
but i ain't tryna see my momma
see a nigga blueish
album coming soon
sneaker may come sooner

far as lyrical precision i'm imperial loser
inferior clueless niggas ain't really conducive
