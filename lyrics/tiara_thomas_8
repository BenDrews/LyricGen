you’re just like the rest of 'em
don't tell me that you love me
yeah , i remember every message you wrote
you said you'd put no one above me , oh
now i shouldn’t have broken your stuff
but you shouldn’t have broken up with me
you think i’m crazy , oooo
i think the same thing
how could you blame me ?
don't act like you don’t love me now
you were just callin' me ( callin' me , callin' me )
don’t act like you gonna shut me out , oh
you were just ballin' saying'
baby baby
please boy
no one loves me like you do , do you , you do , baby
oh , nobody fucks me like you do , do you , you do , baby
oh , nobody fucks me like you do , you do , you do , bae

cause you know i don't mean it
but your so conceited
i hate every last girl that you skeeted

and that's just the start of it
the part of it that gets harder is my motherfuckin' fault
cause what retard would put their heart in this shit
i did , because i guess i'm just retarded as shit
or maybe parched in the bitch , got caught now parked in the ditch
but it's alright , cause we both in sync no bye bye , bye
and i know that it's no surprise , that it's no surprise
yeah , there's no surprise that a nigga gon' lie lie
and you know a nigga ride at the right time
cause he knows that i'm all of his life lines
and i know that he's build like a pipeline
and we gon' have it all for the limelight
