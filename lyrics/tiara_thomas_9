story of my life
cupid shot an arrow , got me deeper than a knife
i'm married to misery , i swear i am his wife
according to history , on this down hill flight
and it's just not progressing
i been tryna make it work , i guess i'm too aggressive
and i get so upset that i'm obsessive
bust the windows out your car and got myself arrested
uhm , but i guess that's love for ya
cupid tricked me when he said , " i got a drug for ya ! "
he said , " it's stronger than anything.. "
" jus let me hit you in the back with this arrow , this might sting. "
said that you love me , put this spear through my heart
took me a year to get it out , and now i'm here in the dark
tryna figure how to heal this mark , you dog
kill him
he doesn't save us like he say he will
that why my feelings are gone
kill him
kill cupid , whoah , kill him
the second verse isn't the end
like , maybe this shit started right where it began
you need to be koy little love
said cause i miss playin game with you little love , fuckas
and i'm not easily pleased
them niggas alter egos ain't bringin' me to my knees
but , blame cupid he's the reason i bleed
if you ain't tryna hear me bitch , then you ain't speakin' to me
cause , i'm a hero & player because i am cute enough to be
what you want me to be , look inside of me
you won't like what you see , you'll see
he doesnt save us like he say he will
that's why my feelings are gone , gone
kill him
kill cupid , woah , kill him
