you know there's a light that glows by the front door
don't forget the keys under the mat
when childhood stars shine , always stay humble and kind
go to church cause your momma says to
visit grandpa every chance that you can
it won't be wasted time
always stay humble and kind
hold the door say please say thank you
don't steal , don't cheat , and don't lie
i know you got mountains to climb but
always stay humble and kind
when the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
when the work you put in is realized
let yourself feel the pride but
always stay humble and kind
don't expect a free ride from no one
don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why
bitterness keeps you from flying
always stay humble and kind
know the difference with sleeping with someone
and sleeping with someone you love
i love you ain't no pick up line so
always stay humble and kind
hold the door say please say thank you
don't steal , don't cheat , and don't lie
i know you got mountains to climb but
always stay humble and kind
when the dreams you're dreamin' come to you
when the work you put in is realized
let yourself feel the pride but
always stay humble and kind
when it's hot , eat a root beer popsicle
shut off the ac and roll the windows down
let that summer sun shine
always stay humble and kind
don't take for granted the love this life gives you
when you get where you're goin'
don't forget turn back around
and help the next one in line
always stay humble and kind
