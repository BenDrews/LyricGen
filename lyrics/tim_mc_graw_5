ain't it just like a tear
to go and blur out everything
ain't it just like glass
to fall and break so easily
ain't it just like love
to leave a mark on the skin and underneath
yeah , when the pain goes and shadows everything
keep your eyes on me
keep your eyes on me
when it hurts too much to see
keep your eyes on me
ain't it the sinner
who gets all the grace sometimes
ain't it the saint
who picks up the pieces left behind
yeah , and it's human to hurt the one
you hurt the one you love the most
and you can't find the sun
keep your eyes on me
when you're lost in the dark
keep your eyes on me
when the light in your heart is
too burned out to see
keep your eyes on me
you swear you're all alone sometimes
keep your eyes on me
and you can't find your way home sometimes
keep your eyes on me
keep your eyes on me
keep your eyes on me
when you're lost in the dark
keep your eyes on me
when the light in your heart is
too burned out to see
keep your eyes on me
