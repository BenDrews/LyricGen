diamond rings and old barstools
one's for queens and one's for fools
one's the future and one's the past
one's forever and one won't last
it ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
it ain't like watered down whiskey and coke
i guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
like me and you
and diamond rings and old barstools
the wrongs and rights , the highs and lows
the " i love yous , " the " i told you sos "
past few miles to wherever's home
another morning waking up alone
it ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
it ain't like watered down whiskey and coke
i guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
like me and you
and diamond rings and old barstools
we ain't like midnight and cigarette smoke
nothing like watered down whiskey and coke
i guess some things just don't mix like you hoped
like me and you
and diamond rings and old barstools
