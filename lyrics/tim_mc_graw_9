roll , won't you come roll with me
slow , fast , full speed
girl where - ever sweet time takes us
hang , with me down this old road
only god knows where we'll go
don't matter long as i've got your love
i don't ever wanna wake up
looking into someone else's eyes
with another voice calling me " baby "
on the other end of the phone
a new girl puttin' on her make up
for a dinner on a friday night
i don't ever wanna know , no , no , no
no other shotgun rider beside me
singin' to the radio , ooo , oo
slide , slide over nice and close
lay your head down on my shoulder
you can fall asleep , i'll let you—
—dream , life ain't nothing but a dream
don't wanna be , cruisin' through this dream without you
i don't ever wanna wake up
looking into someone else's eyes
another voice calling me " baby "
on the other end of the phone
a new girl puttin' on her make up
for a dinner on a friday night
no i don't ever wanna know , no , no , no
no other shotgun rider beside me
singin' to the radio , ooo , oo
