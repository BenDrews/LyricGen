clair i've told you before don't you dare
get back into bed can't you see that is late
no you can't have a drink
oh alright then , but wait just a bit
while i in an effort to baby sit
capture my breath what there is left of it
you can be murder at this hour of the day
but in the morning tonight will seem a life time away
oh clair , clair
kick in the door waving the mic sword
feeling violent , about to take an oath of silence
they call me snake - eyes , ever since master b.i.g died
move like arashikage , microphone hokage
ladies rub your titties if you love hip - hop like i love tinashe
now whose who ?
swimming in water they call you seafood
im sifu , balancing on a ski - doo
practicing wu - shu in a pair of new shoes
can't , handle my jutsu
now you lose
uh , raw vibes bad to the bone
that rhetoric raw hide , changing dog's life
i toss mics off a building and yell boss life
jump down and catch them before they touch the ground and cough rhymes
i'm sick as fuck
catching bullets from andrew luck in the back of a moving pickup truck
the game's in good hands
i be the man from another land
i come in peace into the ( ? )
i'm feeling ill , i need ten nurses
i'm on some perf shit , fornicating these verses
where all my real live niggas that be to bust
my bitches if you with it just get down with us
the motor city repping niggas dangerous
who fucking with us ?
nobody fucking with us
speeding through life on high waves
i was living
gunning engine ( ? ) rifle and dipping
i’m blowing loud with the windows down
trying to get this shit rolling
fuck this kind of lifestyle
i got to do it , keep going
glorious is ss deloreans
the audience applauding him
came to these stages from the audience so
using common sense was illogical
im coming for this game like im leaving from the locker room
out of sorts a niggas jersey never matched his shoes
could see the bigger picture
still i need the proofs
couldn’t let negatives knock my positives loose
they’ll probably love it if a real sings blues
rules like glue upon my free spirit
won’t let them come near it
cloud my vision my soul , it need clearing
then it drift just a little bit
sell another hit
off these sticky cigarillo licks
driven as a speedway trying to put this bridge together
one’s cool , four is better
bitter better , with whatever
chilly as mittens in these cold winter michigan months
in april is the fab five , it should come
we yelling raise it up ( what , what )
raise it up ( what , what )
man this four springs nigga , raisins in the sun
purple light from off a grapevine
all my niggas stay live
now who the realest ?
now who we rolling on donuts
shout out to dilla
now who the illest ?
now who the realest ?
now who we rolling on donuts
shout out to dilla
now who the realest ?
now who the illest ?
now who we rolling on donuts
shout out to dilla
yeah yeah
this for my one - two stepping
day at a time grind
stacking paper for mines
fine wine just get better
with every second
( ? )
thats more flow and more motion than ocean
you fucking with a ridiculous
nameless on production
reporting live the
eye of the storm , filet the beat
blast the cannon at your minions
rolling with all them cool birds
leaving the grey poupon
been strong since fighting teenagers
shit as a fifth grader
coming with more flavor than
collision package gummy savers
master of the dark force
when your oil complexion turn turmoil
within the opposite
to sum it up , i got to get wild
where all my real live niggas that be to bust
my bitches if you with it just get down with us
the motor city repping niggas dangerous
who fucking with us ?
nobody fucking with us
