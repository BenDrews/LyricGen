in the desert when i heard your name
in the desert sand where we would lay
in the desert sun i burned my face
you deserted me but you left the pain
when the sky turns into red
i'll be out here on my own
don't forget i once called your heart my home
if the wind should ever change
who's to say that you will still be the same
but neither will i
in the desert where i saw your smile
in the desert sand where we would play
in the desert heat my tears will dry
you deserted me when you walked away
middle of nowhere
( i'm livin in the )
middle of nowhere yeah
( stuck here livin in the )
middle of nowhere
won't you come find me there ooh
in the desert where i lost my way
where the wind blew sand and hid the road
though the desert days are hard to bare
still the desert nights are always cold
middle of nowhere
( i'm livin in the )
middle of nowhere yeah
( stuck here livin in the )
middle of nowhere
won't you come find me there
mmm
