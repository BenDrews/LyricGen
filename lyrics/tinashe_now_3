astronaut helmet , view from out here got me feeling rather selfish
just left the seventh ring , saturn still my emblem
distance comes natural to artists , know i been down for this , like parsnips
now my mind is my vehicle , few gears no car seats
few fears that feel costly , i thought that i lost me
everybody wanna be cold , i'm just tryna warm the soul
support my bros and at the same time build a zone
i ain't with the antics most these dudes seek , ain't hiding
i guess i got too much pride in , vibing
in a space , planet earth in the peephole
open books got torn , so we always chose to keep closed
text read that she wanted to see me but she can't reach me cause i'm in the
middle of nowhere , i'm living in the
middle of nowhere , stuck here living in the
middle of nowhere , won't you come find me there
mmm
still , astronaut helmet , view from out here got me feeling rather selfish
just left the seventh ring , saturn still my emblem
distance comes natural to artistic movements , it's proven
niggas too proud most times , rather sit in silence , blowing clouds most times
although it's loud most times , missing the true feeling , from sound most times
i observe and translate , waiting for the day this song won't be categorised as fan made
like have a proper answer for my mum , asking me what's your plan babe
still keeping positives from your bad days
people with more telling me work with what i got
as i look left and right i admit it's not a lot
talking to myself more for therapy , like jelly be , i'm set in the
middle of nowhere , i'm living in the
middle of nowhere , stuck here living in the
middle of nowhere , won't you come find me there
mmm
nowhere , in the middle of , in the
in the desert where i lost my ways
where the wind blew sand and hit the road
thought the desert days are hard to bare
still the desert nights are always cold
middle of nowhere , i'm living in the
middle of nowhere , stuck here living in the
middle of nowhere , won't you come find me there
mmm
nowhere , won't you come find me
