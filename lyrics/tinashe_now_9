( you were always )
trying to make him fancy you

going on like you love me up and
( you were always )
making him think you loved him up and
( you were always )
making me think twice about you cause
( you were always )
trying to make my head spin
( you were always )
saying to me you're sure about this and
( you were always )
sulking when you dont get your way and
( you were always )
trying to catch me out so much and
( you were always )
talking about your feelings were strong and
( you were always )
making me think you're gonna do wrong
( you were always )
trying to switch me off and on
( you were always )
trying to know what i am on

forgetting that what we are doing is wrong

trying to bring me down and
( you were always )
telling me to do this telling me to do that
( you were always )
trying to pretend you're busy for me
( you were always )
telling me you love me , telling me you want me
( you were always )
change your faults and blaming me
( you were always )
spying cause you had no trust
( you were always )
thats when girl's say tinche's a must
( you were always )
trying to present your move on..
( you were always )
trying to keep your eye on me
( you were always )
telling your friends you didn't care
( you were always )
phoning telling me you care
( you were always )
seeming to forget that i moved on
( you were always )
trying to tell me i need you
( you were always )
moaning , groaning , still not knowing
( you were always )
bredding me and begging me
( you were always )
pretending that it weren't over
( you were always )
dizzy
we was tingzing time ago
( you were always )
sweet at first but swiftly changed
( you were always )
acting odd and acting strange
( you were always )
trying to keep me in control
( you were always )
flirting like some cheap hoe
( you were always )
playing some annoying mental game
( you were always )
wrong and you try and pass the blame
( you were always )
acting like i wouldn't go
( you were always )
( but hear the new diffence though )
