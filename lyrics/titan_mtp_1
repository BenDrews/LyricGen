after kronos dethroned his father
by castration while he slept
he threw his genitals
deep into the sea
the twelve titans ruled the heavens
ouranos told him of the prophecy
you'll be overthrown
by your own son
he'll defeat you
as you defeated me
to thwart his impending doom
all his children he would eat
because they're alli mmortal
they remained alive
trapped inside his gut
a prison for all five
rhea was enraged
a mother with no child
the sixth conception came
she went to crete to hide
when kronos came to crete
making sure the child is dead
she gave him a stone in cloths
he swallowed that instead
in a year the child matured
he waged a war on his father
the mighty zeus prepared
for the battle
of the titans
warlord !
he forced kronos
to spit up his kin
after his refusal
of restoring justice
so begins the titanomachy
the gods fought from mt. olympus
the titans from mt. othrys
after ten years of fighting
the war hung balanced even
gaia prophesized , victory for zeus
if he aligned , fathers' prisoners
3 cyclopes and 3 hecatoncheires
he freed them from tartarus
the cyclopes gave zeus thunder
and blessed him with fierce lightning
hecatoncheires' one hundred arms
hurling boulders at the titans
the sea rang up
the heavens shook
the earth crashed
olympus reeled
flame rose up into the sky
thunderstone blinded eyes
titans fell at their feet
see the end , titanomachy
they were chained there
in gloomy tartarus
behind the bronze wall
pit of evil
beneath the earth
warlord !
