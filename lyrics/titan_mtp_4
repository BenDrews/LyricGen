verse 1 ( everydeyoe )
so cue the metronome , compute the right tempo
golden flow like a drunk pissing on the side of the road
green smoke , blew out the brown woodrow
red eyes , white draggin' doja not the yu - gi - oh !
you didn't know ? sacred g's ? me and my brother cryo ?
nad's on the boards like shaq , sabonis or mutumbo
blowin' milky way's and andromeda galaxies into the breeze
man power grew to three with the final puzzle piece
snug fit - - picture perfect the drug kids
get constructive licking tabs of albert's substance
mixing boom bap with mosh - pits
cause metal's what we spawned with
cap steez and parkway drive broadened the horizons
i hit artemis to flick me up by orion & delphinus was smoking moon rocks with zeus' lightning
profuse rhymin' , boot leg with strength like moon shine &
my crews climbin' - in due time we'll be viewed as a giant
heavy steppers , light bearers dendera hieroglyphics encrypted in my scriptures
proficiently depicted
proceed to grip a guiness , and put the stout to my snout
coffee and chocolate - y bubbles dancing up in my mouth
the microbrew meditator
savor the flavor but i don't save it for later
go in on the spot like the face of a crater
my force of nature like an f5 tornado
it's everydeyoe i'll leave your head spinning like a dreidel
smashing fire bags , molotov - mazeltov
kick back like kalishnakovs
hear the kicks and then we kicks it off
my merkaba is my crystal ball
master of ceramony vs. masters of bologna that's the rest of yall
( x2 )
cause i do this every daayoo
forest fire gets controlled then the track gets smoked
so pack that - - bowl and pass that - - roach
we toke until it's crumbs then we order some more
i'm out... of weed
( cryogenic )
ayo nads , bring that fuckin beat back
( ronin ) *michelle or mk ashley*
you got it dude
..god damnit deyoe
verse 2 ( cryogenic )
poppin' off the prototype , we cold as ice
cryogenic cross the crowd in a shroud when the weed ignite
i flick a solar strike , an arsonist with spit
transmit like death grips when i blast the mic
a higher sight , never blinded , stay shinin'
like the wu - tang chains in the 90's , still climbin'
we reside in , mt.hood territory titans , still retcitin'
raw raps in all caps to boom baps with doom's mask
i'm blasted of a fraction of this tablet movin' too fast
lost in pans labyrinth , elaborate moves immaculate
accurate on an acid trip
anarchy and blasphmeous flows that i impose
verbal weapons strapped like gta codes
i roast a whole bowl then roam the twilight zone
all black just like a crow , swing swords like jon snow
technique immortal
ya name in my death note , put pens to and flex flows
ink fill the page i embedd it with my stencil
complex like chess , energies throughout my vessel
i raise it tenfold , echo boom within the threshold
trynna top the tempest , hippy hydro smokin' chemist
on the edges of perception , check the method that i'm cheffin'
grillin' beats up in a session till perfection if presented
suspended in animation , blaze the fragrance feel amazin'
in my spaceship i'm engravin' my way
throughout the galaxy , bending time and reality
visualizing the realism of life and actuality
fuck whose the baddest a persons status depends on gravity
alchemy illmatic , graph schematics and fatalities
casually craft a masterpiece
cry recite an epic , heiroglyphs in new demensions
quantum leap into the future then rewind back to the present
its never endin' , 3001 i have ascended
planted on this planet , breaking shackles dealing damage
liquid swords what i brandish , drop nukes from higher vantage
points upon the canvas , light joints for mind expansion
packs improve the graphics , established out the stratos
vanish in a haze , roll up and get blazed
bouquets get saut√©ed , top off the ipa , smash brews in broad day
that's me and everydey - o
ya mind blows explodes through rap codes
unfold the gold scroll , then stroll the globe slow
puff air and hydro , we just a stones throw away from doomsday
sacred g's came to play , its a massacre
