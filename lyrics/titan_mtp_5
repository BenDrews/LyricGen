rapping protocol online
brace for impact when beat drops
rap sequence initiated
stand by for titan bars
mankind aligned with giants
goliath and david made an alliance
i've tried to find the kind of pilot
that i can bind with , fight and die with
i'm your titan
fell from the sky like a strike of lightning
my size is frightening
no wonder why all the hype has heightened
ogres hold the front line , you guided
by the cover fire that i've provided
atlas has your back , stryders fly in
if you're on foot , zipline and hide quick
ahhh , i'm on fire , thermite ignited
get behind this , try survivin'
nice arrival , i like your timing
do you mind if i hitch a ride with ?
got your license to pilot titans ?
if you're ready for an epic quest , then climb in !
" a titan is only as mighty
as the pilot inside him "
send all your troops , tell them to come in a horde
a little flak is collateral that i can afford
your bullets feel like an itch , that i'm gonna ignore
don't play with a fire if you don't wanna get scorched
i'm bored of my gun , i'll have more fun with a sword
i see you running on walls , but i'm running the war
i'll tell ya what double jump is for
the quicker to retreat , so i don't punish you more
i've got the power within my core
i'll keep my battle wicked short - this ain't infinite war
you're the muscles , i'm the brains
if i need to hustle , you can take the reigns
ya' all better run for cover when i get in my mech
unless you wanna see the wreckage and how messy it gets
at the end of every battle ain't no enemies left
so make like a vcr , and eject !
the great gods of olympus
never saw what they had comin'
when the titans rose from ashes
and all the olympians went runnin'
so if you can't fight your battles
then you know just who to call
i will stand by your side
until the titanfall
tactical system online , radar engaged
good , cause i'm ready to rage
i'll hit the camo , weapons drawn
you stay here and protect the spawn
it won't take long , i'll make the call
then you drop in , wreck them all
( got it ? )
running and gunning , i'm the kind of pilot
that you never wanna fight , cause i'm ultra - violent
if i go high , and you go low
then i'm riding on your head like a rodeo
take your battery out , there goes your shield
keep the pressure turned up , no time to heal
better back up quick , believe me trust
when i call in my titan , you're gonna get crushed
map hack , nobody can hide
20 tons of heavy metal but i'm chilling inside
there they are , kill 'em with fire
no problem , target acquired
i'm the pilot , you're the titan
bros for life. lets get to fightin'
wait , whats this button for ?
eject , eject , that's a nuclear core !
the great gods of olympus
never saw what they had comin'
when the titans rose from ashes
and all the olympians went runnin'
so if you can't fight your battles
then you know just who to call
i will stand by your side
until the titanfall
you and i are bionic
side by side , symbiotic
i know i am the pilot
but you are guiding my conscience ?
organic and robotic
mechanically bonded
i will stand here , undaunted
until my titan has fallen
cuz i'm tired of walkin'
undivided my army
right to my side , they'll be flocking
just like disciples and prophets
you put your faith in the gods
and pray to see me demolished
but i've forsaken the gods
cuz my titan is strongest
and now my titan is fallin'
if i were you , i'd be running
the great gods of olympus
never saw what they had comin'
when the titans rose from ashes
and all the olympians went runnin'
so if you can't fight your battles
then you know just who to call
i will stand by your side
until the titanfall
the great gods of olympus
never saw what they had comin'
when the titans rose from ashes
and all the olympians went runnin'
so if you can't fight your battles
then you know just who to call
i will stand by your side
until the titanfall
