i used to like walking with my eyes down
i'd sleep all day and fret away the night hours
but then i saw the sun and felt its light's power
and i found out the planet ain't no private house
now i turn a brave bully to a shy coward
make a loud lout silent as a quiet mouse
then i make them hand over the white cloud
and then they're leaving me with a polite bow
and i've got plans i haven't time to write down
i'll incite a riot , fire flying all around
when i'm crying out , i'm howling with the wild hounds
don't wanna buy an ounce
for me , the right amount is the entire pound
i only like it when it's dimed out
i only like it when it's dimed out
i only like it when it's dimed out
when it's dimed out , when it's dimed out , when it's dimed out
i don't chase after clocks or calendars
i bow down not to masters , gods , nor managers
cause all the greatest artists , they were amateurs
unembarrassed , dressed in only bandages
and i don't read rules or adhere to rituals
i'm an impatient underdog indivisible
and my challengers are talentless imbeciles
when my chalice is full , i am invincible
i don't listen to parents or priests or principals
inconsiderate of little individuals
when they ration out their miniscule residuals
shit by the fistful
as long as there's a law , i'll be a criminal
i only like it when it's dimed out
i only like it when it's dimed out
i only like it when it's dimed out
when it's dimed out , when it's dimed out , when it's dimed out
when it's dimed out , when it's dimed out
when it's dimed out , when it's dimed out
i turned it up to four and couldn't feel it
i turned it up to five , it wasn't real yet
turning it up to six wouldn't reveal it
seven was a secret
eight was reaching
nine was decent , but
i really liked it when it dimed out
i only really like it when it's dimed out
i like , " like it " like it dimed out
i like it , like it , like it , like it dimed out
i only like it when it's dimed out
i only like it when it's dimed out
i only like it when it's dimed out
when it's dimed out , when it's dimed out , when it's dimed out
whatever's inside , let it climb out
that was his plan and it's mine now
