''i am now the most miserable man living. if what i feel were equally distributed to the whole human family , there would not be one cheerful face on earth. "
everything makes me nervous
and nothing feels good for no reason
waking up , it's rarely worth it
the same dark dread every morning
senior year here in mahwah
a new world just around the corner
leave me behind , let me stagnate
in a fortress of solitude
smoking's been okay so far
but i need something that works faster
so all i want for christmas is no feelings
no feelings now and never again !
there is a faceplate all brown and red that stretches across my mouth
it's worn for protection , nobody gets in and nobody gets out
i used to look myself in the mirror at the end of every day
but i took the one thing that made me beautiful and threw it away
i was a river , i was a tall tree , i was a volcano
but now i'm asleep on top of a mountain , i've been covered in snow
yes , i have surrendered what made me human and all that i thought was true
so now there's a robot that lives in my brain and he tells me what to do
and i can do nothing without his permission or ( which ) wasn't part of the plan
so now in a rock ridge pharmacy i will be waiting for my man
but there is another , down in a dungeon , who never gave up the fight
and he'll be forever screaming , sometimes i hear him say , on a quiet night , he says :
" you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser , man !
" you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser
you will always be a loser , now...
and that's okay ! "
