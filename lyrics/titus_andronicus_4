some days start with an earthquake
the bed shakes until it breaks
and i hate to be awake
most days start with a dull ache
enough weight to crush my face
and i hate to be awake
both ways are about the same
making my mouth complain
is pounding the trouser snake
so i just lie and count the chains
assign them a thousand names
to praise their astounding strength
my portrait , proud and vain , hanging without a frame
on the wall of the house of pain
fragrance of a pungent skunk
hung in the repugnant
dungeon where i have sunk
but i can't say it just once
fragrance of a pungent skunk
hung in a repugnant
dungeon where i have sunk
ooh it stunk
cowering in the glowering gloom
ex - human left entombed , never to be exhumed
remember the flowers in bloom just for an hour or two
then back to the sourest mood
forfeit the power to move
total paralysis soon
none welcome to the
ruins of my room
door's closed and there’s no window
to this odious remote rodent hole
inside we'd find the frozen ghost
but we won’t expose his decomposing soul
flesh that roasts on smoldering coals
blood that flows from broken nose
the moss that grows on rolling stones
floating boats , the ocean throw and pull below
" the loser's movements are truly fruitless
the stupid student won't improve one bit
he refuses to do his tricks
confused with the rudiments
cruel unusual punishment
may prove prudent "
hey ! i hate to be awake
i hate to be awake
i hate to be awake
i hate to be awake
i hate to be awake
i hate to be awake
i hate to be awake
i hate to be awake
i hate to be awake
