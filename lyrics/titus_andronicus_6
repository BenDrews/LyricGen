i don't mind when i lose my mind
yeah , i lost my mind , seven eight or nine times
and you wouldn't mind if you lost your mind
having lost your mind already eight or nine times
i don't mind , no it feels just fine
no it feels just fine when i lose my mind
and it looks so nice when it's flying right by
now i don't mind when i lose my mind
my whole life i've been losing my mind
it was 1989 when i lost my mind
for the very first time i went down in the mine
going down in the mine i didn't know what i'd find
but whatever i'd find , say that it was mine
and i brought a little bird , it was short lived
and i lost my mind when the little bird died
because as i stopped to cry for the little bird's life
for the moment my mind was out of my sight
and i turned back around to a terrible surprise
i had lost my mind for the very first time
i lost my mind for the very first time
since i was a child , they tried to let me slide
then i lost it twice , they said it was a crime
and my hands were tied , i was read my rights
it was a real short list written in little , tiny type
and they built their perfect prison and locked me inside
i cried , " this is so wrong , " they said " it's alright "
and then a plate full of pills , i swallowed them dry
i was displayed in a cage , they claimed , in the name of science
and they probed , prodded , realigned my spine
'til they said i could walk in a straight enough line
and then they pushed me back out into the bright sunlight
i didn't know what it meant to be institutionalised
yeah i begged for readmission , it was denied
where do you reside when you've lost your mind ?
where you gonna hide when you lose your mind ?
so i went back to where i had last seen my mind
he was sitting right there with his eyes real wide
and looking into mine said " i apologise
but being confined is something i cannot abide
but if you'll take me back we'll give it one more try "
then we hugged , high - fived and stayed up all night
in the light i realised they were all just lies
he had robbed me blind and hadn't said goodbye
i was too desirous , so unwise
i got excited and i lost my mind
why , oh why , must i lose my mind ?
since then it's been a struggle just to stay alive
suicide seems superior than trying to survive
that's why when i'm in yr sight , there'll be no sign of a smile
but the sound of a sigh i am happy to provide
lastly , never ask me , " can i know yr mind ? "
no , my mind is too wild , it's the wandering kind
and i never know when it might be likely to arrive
so i don't mind when i lose my mind
no , i don't mind when i lose my mind
no , i don't mind when i lose my mind
