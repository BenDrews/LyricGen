" the audience was large and brilliant. upon my weary heart was showered smiles , plaudits , and flowers , but beyond them , i saw thorns and troubles innumerable. "
it was a pretty good gpa
we got a couple of good grades
and it sounded like a pretty good seven inch
and winter didn't seem so cold
and i had a smile for everyone i know
i was starting to get comfortable in the place that i'm in
and it used to not mean anything
it used to not mean anything
it used to not mean anything , but it really means nothing now
nothing means anything anymore
everything is less than zero
and i know it won't do much good
getting drunk and sad and singing
but i'm at the end of my rope
and i feel like swinging
it was an unflattering photograph
and people saw it all over town
hanging up on the wall above the urinal
hear the man with the notepad say
" oh , they're funny , but they drink too much "
" don't be surprised if they don't amount to nothing at all "
we were talking about giving up
we were talking about lying down
we were talking about tying off
wasn't it supposed to mean something now ?
let them see you struggle and they're going to tear you apart
you ain't never been no virgin , kid , you were fucked from the start
they're all going to be laughing at you
you can't make it on merit , not on merit and merit alone
dan mcgee tried to tell me , " there ain't no more rolling stones "
they're all going to be laughing at you
i've been called out , cuckolded , castrated , but i survived
i am covered in urine and excrement but i'm alive
and there's a white flag in my pocket never to be unfurled
though with their hands 'round my ankles , they bring me down for another swirl
and they tell me , " take it easy buddy , it's not the end of the world ! "
" and there and then and bathed by the rising sun
my son in his grave , in his rude - dug grave i deposited
ending my vigil strange with that , vigil of night and battle - field dim
vigil for boy of responding kisses , ( never again on earth responding )
vigil for comrade swiftly slain , vigil i never forget , how as day brighten'd
i rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket
and buried him where he fell. "
