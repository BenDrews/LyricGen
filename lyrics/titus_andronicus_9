" let's rock. "
crazy heart , where have you gone ?
i thought that you and me were really getting along !
left alone to dread the dawn
like some kind of science experiment gone wrong
i could've made history , now i've been made history
and who knew that victory could be so slippery ?
cover the thick bloodstains
on your sick young brain
just take your ritalins
then you can play the old hits again
you explained the abyss away
and i can't listen when you say you're not missing me
you kissed me in the blistering heat , oh yeah , yeah !
right there on the street with tears on my glistening cheek
now no one listens to me , they tell me that i'm twisted and weak
i see that i was picked to be the picture in the dictionary
look up " addicted , " that's me
then look up " wicked disease "
then look up " sick of police "
then look up " victim " closely , ooh yeah
i meet the mystery beast , the same one my sister receives
he comes to bludgeon and beat , demands me on both knees
he will not admit defeat and when he pricks , i'm going to bleed
and i can raise fists or flee , soon shouting , " no , mister , please ! "
he destroys the diseases
as though jesus could see us
high up in a cathedral
where an evil heart freezes
and even the devil would start to believe it
when the man without equal , from the pulpit , preaches
you gotta believe he can show you the secrets
" that's what a priest is , mama "
he comes to obliterate all of my mischievous ways
and leaves me a useless disgrace , silent through limitless rage
violently neutered and caged , stuffed with subliminal hate
i'm nothing but a puppet at play , crying in a beautiful place
another brutal display
on an invisible face
in a legal - ish space
it's the usual way within a week of wednesday
crazy heart , where have you gone ?
i thought that you and me...
i thought that you and me...
i thought that you and me were really getting along
" all right. "
