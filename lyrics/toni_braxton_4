i'll always think of you
inside of my private thoughts
i can imagine you
touching my private parts
with just the thought of you
i can't help but touch myself
that's why i want you so bad
just one night of
moonlight , with you there beside me
all night , doin' it again and again
you know i want you so bad
baby , baby , baby
ooooh , i get so high
when i'm around you baby
i can touch the sky
you make my temperature rise
you're making me high
baby , baby , baby , baby
can't get my mind off you
i think i might be obsessed
the very thought of you
makes me want to get undressed
i want to be with you
in spite of what my heart says
i guess i want you too bad
all i want is
moonlights , with you there inside me
all night , doin it again and again
you know i want you so bad
baby , baby , baby , baby
ooooh , i get so high
when i'm around you baby
i can touch the sky
you make my temperature rise , oh boy
you're making me high
baby , baby , baby , baby
i want to feel your heart and soul inside of me
let's make a deal , you roll , i lick
and we can go flying into ecstasy
oh darling you and me
light my fire
blow my flame
take me , take me
take me away
