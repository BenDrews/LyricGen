oh , oh
no , no
ooh , toni
i gave you the benefit of the doubt
'til you showed me what you were about
your true colors came out , oh
and your words couldn't hide the sin
'cause the truth about where you been
is in a fragrance i can't recognize
just standing there , scratching your head
bloodshot eyes , drunk with regret
hanging yourself ten feet over the edge
i'm done with this , feeling like an idiot
loving you , i'm over it
i just don't love you , don't love you no more
you , you are so yesterday
never thought you'd lose my love this way
now you come begging me to stay
see you , you are so yesterday
i won't let you rain on my parade
i don't wanna hear a thing you say
you're so yesterday
baby , what you're saying to me is
there's no more you and i
i couldn't get it right on yesterday
so kiss our tomorrows goodbye
baby , love should brought me home
should've just been a man about it
but now i'm crying like a baby
girl , your love was like my blanket
don't know what to do without it
i'm standing here , pleading my case
you don't care to hear what i say
hanging yourself ten feet over the edge , oh no , baby
my promises don't mean nothing
the end is so disgusting
i just don't love you , don't love you no more
you , you are so yesterday
never thought you'd lose my love this way
now you come begging me to stay
honey , you , you are so yesterday
i won't let you rain on my parade
i don't wanna hear a thing you say , so yesterdayy
and now you wanna reminisce , say you wanna try again
it started with a little kiss but we can't even be friends
no , no , now i never wanna see you , never wanna feel you , never wanna hear you
i don't love you , don't need you , can't stand you no more
you , you are so yesterday
never thought you'd lose my love this way
now you come begging me to stay
you , you are so yesterday
i won't let you rain on my parade
i don't wanna hear a thing you say , so yesterdayy
so yesterday , so yesterday
so yesterday , so yesterday
just because of yesterday
so yesterday , so yesterday
so yesterday , so yesterday
