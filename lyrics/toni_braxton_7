if i never feel you in my arms again
if i never feel your tender kiss again
if i never hear i love you now and then
will i never make love to you once again
please understand if love ends
then i promise you , i promise you
that , that i shall never breathe again
breathe again
breathe again
that i shall never breathe again
breathe again
and i can't stop thinking about
about the way things used to be
and i can't stop thinking about
about the love that you make to me
and i can't get you outta my head
how in the world will i begin
to let you walk right out my life
and blow my heart away
and i can't stop caring about
about the apple of my eye
and i can't stop doing without
without the center of my life
and i can't get you outta my head
and i know i can't pretend
that i won't die if you decide
you won't see me again
and i can't stop thinking about
about the way my life would be
no i can't stop thinking about
how could your love be leavin' me
and i can't get you outta my mind
god knows how hard i tried
and if you walk right out my life
god knows i'd surely die
and i can't stop doing without
without the rhythm of my heart
no i can't stop doing without
for i would surely fall apart
and i can't get you outta my mind
cause i know i can't deny it
and i would die if you decide
you won't see me again
