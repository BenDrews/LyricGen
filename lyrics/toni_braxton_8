since you been gone
i been hanging around here lately
with my mind messed up
jumped in my car
tried to clear my mind
didn't help me
i guess i'm all messed up now , baby
soon as i jumped into my ride
those memories start to play
a song comes on
on the radio
and there you are , baby
once again
it's just another sad love song
racking my brain like crazy
guess i'm all torn up
be it fast or slow
it doesn't let go
or shake me
and it's all because of you
since you been gone
i keep thinking about you , baby
gets me all choked up
this heart of mine
keeps dreaming of you
and it's crazy
you'd think i'd had enough , yeah
soon as i get you out my head
i'm in my car again
ooh , darling
just one request from the radio
i'm back in love , sugar
once again
just another sad love song
racking my brain like crazy
guess i'm all torn up
be it fast or slow
it doesn't let go
or shake me
oh , babe
here comes the strings
then somebody sings
only takes a beat
and then it starts killing me , darling
only takes one note
i tell ya
from that radio
it's just
another
lonely
love song
it's just another sad love song
racking my brain like crazy
( you know you had me going )
guess i'm all torn up
( going crazy , babe )
be it fast or slow
it doesn't let go
or shake me
oh , yeah , yeah , yeah
so sad , so sad
so sad
so sad , sad love song
ooh
i heard it on the radio last night
so sad , so sad
so sad
so sad
sad love song
ooh , you got me singing
another love song all night
it's just another sad love song
racking my brain like crazy
ooh
and i'm all torn up
be it fast or slow
it doesn't let go
or shake me
ooh
and it's all because of you
so sad
so sad
so sad
sad love song
and it's all because of you
so sad
so sad
so sad
sad love song
