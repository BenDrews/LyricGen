should i even listen ?
should i even try ?
will i just be hearing
the same old lines , baby ?
see , it doesn't matter
what you say this time
cause our whole relationship is built on one lie
you say things aren't the way they seem
but still
you can't come straight with me
how can you think that you're in love ?
when you don't know the meaning of
love shoulda brought you
brought you home last night
you shoulda been with me
shoulda been right by my side
baby
if you cared anything for me
then love woulda brought you to me last night
gotta hand it to you
you had me there for a while
i was so in love with you
i couldn't see past your smile
now i smell the coffee
i got a wake up call
and it left the message
that you just don't care at all
you can't expect me to believe that
she doesn't mean anything
you say that you love only me
you're kinda loving , my darling
i just don't need
love shoulda brought you
brought you home last night
you shoulda been with me
shoulda been right by my side
baby
if you cared anything for me
then you woulda been sincere
and i wouldn't be in tears
and love woulda brought you to me last night
oh , baby , why ?
why do men think
that love's just for the moment
not overtime
please tell me why ?
why should i think
that you're gonna be sincere
are you deserving ?
don't blame me if
i just don't believe
i just don't believe
that you'll always be here
