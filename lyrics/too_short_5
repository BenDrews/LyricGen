i'm single in the streets 'bout to get it in
talkin' 'bout some drinkin' and some mingling , woh
can't believe what i'm seeing , man , all these girls , look , look
hmm , get in the car ya’ll , i just wanna make her feel hot
let me smell your sin girl , damn you look so...
no groupies , see a blonde girl with a brunette
see a nigga cruisin' in the red benz
now that’s a one , two , double up , triple up
so many surprises , oh , so many colors and sizes
love them , i want them , they need me
i'm rollin' coastin'
i see pretty girls everywhere i go
every , everywhere i go , every , everywhere i go ( x4 )
( so many colors and sizes , so many surprises )
guess what ? a nigga turnt up
all the windows closed for the roast up
club club letting out for the post up
all i need is somebody to fly with and smoke this tree
down for doing acid
sit up on that waist let that ass fit
let me feel your skin on mine , unwind , what’s on your mind ?
and tell me somethin’ that moves me
seen all types , different continents
nothing more intriguing than an accent
that's a one , two , double up , get it up
so many surprises , so many colors and sizes
love them , hmm , they're so dope , they're so dope
we're rolling , coasting
when you live like me , you get used to fun
there's an endless supply of the beautiful ones
so i opened up those exotic thighs
the baddest little bitch half black half thai
don’t be prejudice , ‘cause she’s mixed
i'd still fuck the blackest bitch
that's how it is , if you in my world
light skin , white momma , you a white girl
and i got that fever and a big dick , you know what i wanna feed her
met a girl named maria , " it's yo' turn ! " , i love them señoritas
i'd like to fuck them , but then i said : " fuck ‘em "
lil' momma can get a little somethin’
og , too $hort , don't stop
all the pretty girls call me todd
they love me. yahm
