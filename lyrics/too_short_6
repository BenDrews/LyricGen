yeah , rich , homie , quan
yeah nigga
i left the car runnin’ outside
all my bitches pussy ballin' ( too short , too short )
money long , i like tall bread ( too short , too short )
i call all my hoes bitch , just like i'm too short
going broke , i never get
like too short too short
money longer than a freeway
i'm in the foreign car and i'm speedin’
never listen to what he say
you broke nigga that the reason
and then i ran it up like a relay
i won nigga , now i'm eating
and y'all niggas , can't beat me
y'all niggas , can't see me
cause my money up and my tummy tucked
it’s gettin’ colder , by the season
and 100 bucks , it was fronted first
but now i'm older and i see it
money growin' , no teacher
had to teach myself how to get me some money
going broke ? i don't see it
a gotta couple hustles , gotta keep me somethin
you might beat me down but can't beat this gun
ridin’ round with that ski mask on cause i need me some
told 12 fuck him around the right , don't read me nothin'
and i keep me a gun , i need my money
pockets got the mumps now
left the car runnin , jumped out
when i
pulled up , new car
old money , got a new broad
been the same nigga since day 1
we’ve been kicking it since we were newborns
talking spaz nigga i got two warnings
you ain't hot nigga , you lukewarm
and i got it girl , what you gonna do it for it ?
my money long never too short..
i front you them bands , you came up too short with my money
yes , i came up to get my cash
cause like too short , i hold them grudges
and i smell with you when everything pretty
take off when it get ugly , disgusted
can't even look at you when i'm in public
but that's nothin’
i done seen my partners kill some niggas just over discussion
and those same partners held it down , none of them got busted
never changed partners , stick to the g code
that's why i trust you and love you
its only one thing i'll always put above you
and that’s that money baby
ben frank , i done made more then 100 baby
i'm on the come up baby , i can't fumble baby
even though wishin’ on me
brand new car , window still got the sticker on it
