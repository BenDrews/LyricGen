i used to have a lot of bitches , straight down for me
doing anything i said even hoeing the street
" aye , okay , pasadena in here
you already know how we get down "
you can't stop me once i'm flowing like a clock i keep it going
you drop a beat i go in never drop it neither owens
i'm just dropping the opponent my pockets need a bonus
yo copying and cloning done got these niggas droning
you zoned in to sleeping and hope and believing
you throw me an mc i know i'm gon' eat him
smooth when i move yo i flow like i'm speaking
bright like a light so i glow like a beacon
these hoes i release them we don't like to keep them
the bong and the weed have me gone like deceased man
strong as a beast i can dunk on your defense
don't fuck with me i can honk at policeman
walk like a g but i talk like i'm me
yo the dog that i be has me bark like a tree
a nigga trip on me the homie spark him like the weed
i'm far from nice you see the way i carbonite the beat ( gone )
gone like the wind so we go all in
have a house party tell the girls go call a friend
the hoes that attend yo fa sho they all 10's
and we gon' be facing l's like we don't like to win
i'm all about that paper what the fuck you thinking
ounces of that og and you know what i'm drinking
i interact with criminals it's just in my instincts
hit it from the back she likes the way my shit be swinging
my loot multiplying while you still dividing
i'm striving to the top that's how far a nigga's climbing
a gram of that prescription until i look like yao ming
i go deep when it's wet like i'm scuba diving
money come quick but she cums faster
niggas stole my style my shit has been mastered
and crafted mixing hashes thinking i can do magic
i'm happy cuz she throw it back with that ass clapping
she ain't ratchet she just had a lot of practice
balling like kobe 81 points on the raptors
marijuana ashes on yall assets
and if she throw it back ima get that ass wet
gone like the wind so we go all in
have a house party tell the girls go call a friend
the hoes that attend fa sho they all 10's
and we gon' be facing l's like we don't like to win
but i'm a dog and i dog my broads
gorilla pimping driving 4 door cars
