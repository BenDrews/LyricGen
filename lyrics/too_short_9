when rearranged , my thoughts of you explain
just why i'm only here to claim
i've gotta make you famous
you're the starring role inside my mind , nicole
if i could only find your purpose , i could take control
i'm sure we belong somewhere , not sure if we'll share
moments , months , or lives i'd like you by my side
enjoy your conversation , abbreviations
i can't focus with a lens when you're in sight
who knew i'd miss the pleasure , heal me from myself
who knew i'd know too much , what's pressure to my health ?
i'm coughing 'cause i'm anxious , anxious 'cause i know
my future's inching close and where am i to go i just don't know
someday , you'll know my styles lame
when i can't provide champagne , will you still say hello
someday , you'll change , it doesn't matter anyway
locked up and say i'm framed , will you still say hello
life's too short to survive , too short for goodbyes
take direction toward concern , i'll be patient in return
who knew i'd miss the pleasure , heal me from myself
who knew i'd know too much , what's pressure to my health ?
i'm coughing 'cause i'm anxious , anxious 'cause i know
my future's inching close and where am i to go i just don't know
someday , you'll know my styles lame
when i can't provide champagne , will you still say hello
someday , you'll change , it doesn't matter anyway
locked up and say i'm framed , will you come say hello
who knew i'd miss the pleasure , heal me from myself
who knew i'd know too much , what's pressure to my health ?
i'm frightened cause i'm fainting , fainting 'cause i know
your future's inching close and where are you to go you don't quite know
someday , someday
someday , you'll know my styles lame
when i can't provide champagne , will you still say hello
someday , you'll change , it doesn't matter anyway
locked up and say i'm framed , will you come say hello
someday , someday , someday
