a dangerous plan , just this time
a stranger's hand clutched in mine
i'll take this chance , so call me blind
i've been waiting all my life
please don't scar this young heart
just take my hand
i was made for loving you
even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through
every bone screaming i don't know what we should do
all i know is , darling , i was made for loving you
hold me close through the night
don't let me go , we'll be alright
touch my soul and hold it tight
i've been waiting all my life
i won't scar your young heart
just take my hand
cause i was made for loving you
even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through
every bone screaming i don't know what we should do
all i know is , darling , i was made for loving you
please don't go , i've been waiting so long
oh , you don't even know me at all
but i was made for loving you
i was made for loving you
even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through
every bone screaming i don't know what we should do
all i know is , darling , i was made for loving you
