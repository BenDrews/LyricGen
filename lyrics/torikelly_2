i like being independent , not so much of an investment
no one to tell me what to do
i like being by myself , don’t gotta entertain anybody else
no one to answer to
but sometimes , i just want somebody to hold
someone to give me their jacket when it's cold
got that young love even when we’re old
yeah sometimes , i want someone to grab my hand
pick me up , pull me close , be my man
i will love you till the end
so if you’re out there i swear to be good to you
but i’m done lookin’ , for my future someone
cause when the time is right
you’ll be here , but for now
dear no one , this is your love song
i don’t really like big crowds
i tend to shut people out
i like my space , yeah
but i’d love to have a soul mate
god will give him to me someday
and i know it’ll be worth the wait
so if you’re out there i swear to be good to you
but i’m done lookin’ , for my future someone ( oooh )
cause when the time is right
you’ll be here , but for now
dear no one , this is your love song
but sometimes , i just want somebody to hold
someone to give me their jacket when it's cold
got that young love even when we’re old
yeah sometimes , i want someone to grab my hand
pick me up , pull me close , be my man
i will love you till the end
so if you’re out there i swear to be good to you
but i’m done lookin’ , for my future someone
cause when the time is right
you’ll be here , but for now
dear no one , this is your love song ( dear no one )
no need to be searching ( dear no one )
( dear no one )
dear no one , this is your love song
