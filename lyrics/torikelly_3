walk around with my head down
but i can't hide with these high heels on
downtown in the thick crowd
but it’s just you that my mind is on
dressed up , got my heart messed up
you got yours and i got mine
it's unfair that i still care
and i wonder where you are tonight
thinkin it could be different , maybe we missed it
thinkin it could be different
it could , it could
it should've been us
should've been a fire , should've been the perfect storm
it should've been us
could've been the real thing , now we'll never know for sure
we were crazy , but amazing
baby , we both know
it should've been us , us
it , it , it should've been us
back and forth like a tug o’ war
what's it all for ? do i want it back ?
still got a little flame for ya
even though you drove me mad
now and then , i pretend
that it's you when i close my eyes
you got yours , i got mine
but i wonder where you are tonight
it should've been us
should've been a fire , should've been the perfect storm
it should've been us
could've been the real thing , now we'll never know for sure
we were crazy , but amazing
baby , we both know
it should've been us , us
it , it , it should've been us
oh oh , oh oh
it should've been us
oh oh , oh oh , oh oh oh
oh oh , oh oh
it should've been us
it , it , it should've been us
oh oh , oh oh , oh oh oh
oh oh , oh oh
oh oh , oh oh , oh oh oh
oh oh , oh oh
thinkin it could be different , maybe we missed it
thinkin it could be different
it could , it could
it should've been us
should've been a fire , should've been the perfect storm
it should've been us
could've been the real thing , now we'll never know for sure
ooh , we were crazy , but amazing
baby , we both know
it should've been us , us
it , it , it should've been us
oh oh , oh oh
it should've been us
oh oh , oh oh , oh oh oh
oh oh , oh oh
oh oh , oh oh
it should've been us
it , it , it should've been us
oh oh , oh oh
it should've been us
oh oh , oh oh , oh oh oh
oh oh , oh oh
oh oh , oh oh
it should've been us
it , it , it should've been us
