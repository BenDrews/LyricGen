i don't wanna be the last man standing
i don't wanna be the lonely one
picking petals when the party's over
no , it's not any fun
cause i'm fragile
and you know this
so hold me
wrap me in love , fill up my cup
empty and only your love can fill up my cup
cause i'm hollow
yeah , i'm hollow , oh oh oh
cause i'm hollow
yeah , i'm hollow , oh oh oh
i don't wanna be the first one folding
i don't wanna be the joker heart
tell me , darling , will you understand me ?
and not show me your cards ?
cause i'm paper - thin
and you , you make me whole again
so hold me
wrap me in love , fill up my cup
empty and only your love can fill up my cup
cause i'm hollow
yeah , i'm hollow , oh oh oh
cause i'm hollow
