goodbye love
you flew right by love
remember the way you made me feel
such young love but something in me knew that it was real
frozen in my head
pictures i'm living through for now
trying to remember all the good times
our life was cutting through so loud
memories are playing in my dull mind
i hate this part , paper hearts
and i'll hold a piece of yours
don't think i would just forget about it
hoping that you won't forget about it
everything is gray under these skies , wet mascara
hiding every cloud under a smile , when there's cameras
and i just can't reach out to tell you
that i always wonder what you're up to
pictures i'm living through for now
trying to remember all the good times
our life was cutting through so loud
memories are playing in my dull mind
i hate this part paper hearts
and i'll hold a piece of yours
don't think i would just forget about it
hoping that you won't forget
i live through pictures as if i was right there by your side
but you'll be good without me and if i could just give it some time
i'll be alright
goodbye love
you flew right by love
pictures i'm living through for now
trying to remember all the good times
our life was cutting through so loud
memories are playing in my dull mind
i hate this part paper hearts
and i'll hold a piece of yours
don't think i would just forget about it
hoping that you won't forget
