everybody's looking for that something
no one ever wants to pay the price
everyone is scared of going nowhere
but we ain't going anywhere tonight
i should be more cynical and tell myself that’s not okay
( to feel this good when i'm with you )
i try my best to fight it , say " i hate you " , but i always stay
woah , oh , oh , cause
ain't nobody love , ain't nobody love like you do
ain't nobody love , ain't nobody love like you do
ain't nobody love , ain't nobody love like you do
ain't nobody love , ain't nobody love like you do
everybody's talking bout the next thing
feel like what they got ain't good enough
but all i wanna do is release the tension ( all right , all right )
bring the conversation back to us ( oh yeah )
i should be more cynical and tell myself that’s not okay
( to feel this good when i'm with you )
i try my best to fight it , say " i hate you " , but i always stay
woah , oh , oh , cause
ain't nobody love , ain't nobody love like you do
ain't nobody love , ain't nobody love like you do
ain't nobody love , ain't nobody love like you do
ain't nobody love , ain't nobody love like you do

i try my best to fight it , say i hate you but i always stay

oh oh oh , oh oh oh

ain't nobody love , ain't nobody love like you do
ain't nobody love , ain't nobody love like you do
ain't nobody love , ain't nobody love like you do
ain't nobody love , ain't nobody love like you do
