since i don't like you i just thought you were cute
that's why i kissed you
got a flying jet i don't get to fly it thought i'm lying down thinkin bout ya
you know know know

we'll go down this road till it turns from color to black and white
or do you not think so far ahead ?
cause i been thinkin bout forever
or do you not think so far ahead ?
cause i been thinkin bout forever
ooooh na na na oooh na na na ooh
