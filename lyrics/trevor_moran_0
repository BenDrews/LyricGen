i like to mess with the people
the ones that don't have the ego
we want to feel good and be bold
we like the best of the best times
the ones we don't have to rewind
all we want is just to be fine
oh yeah , got me feeling like i don't know ya
your head is bigger than the ocean
you got me feeling like , oh
the earth does not revolve around you
stop and drop that stupid attitude
yeah yeah , you're getting way too comfortable
you play me as a fool and you will lose
don't give me things that you can't see
don't really care what you fancy
don't bring the bullshit around me ( around me )
i like to roll with my people
we like to cut up where we go
only the best is what we know
only the best is what we know
oh yeah , got me feeling like i don't know ya
your head is bigger than the ocean
you got me feeling like , oh
the earth does not revolve around you
stop and drop that stupid attitude
yeah yeah , you're getting way too comfortable
you play me as a fool and you will lose
oh yeah , got me feeling like i don't know ya
your head is bigger than the ocean
your head is bigger than the ocean
oh yeah , got me feeling like i don't know ya
your head is bigger than the ocean
you got me feeling like i don't know ya
the earth does not revolve around you
stop and drop that stupid attitude
yeah yeah , you're getting way too comfortable
you play me as a fool and you will lose
