pulling up in black cars , looking like a star
it's about to go down
cameras flashing everywhere
cuz we don't even care , bitch , we're living right now
walked up to the front gate
tipping like a runway , 'bout to go down
well it's not even my birthday , midnight on a thursday
we 'bout to get loud
baby , baby i just dropped to my knees
i don't wanna feel the lights off me
you can follow if you just trust me , woah , woah
baby , baby i just dropped to my knees
i don't wanna feel the lights off me
you can follow if you just trust me , woah , woah
tonight , we're on fire , you can't hide - let's roll , roll
tonight , you and i , we're aligned - let's roll , roll
i'm getting impatient , getting sick of waiting , you already know
tonight , we're on fire , you can't hide - let's roll , roll
take a look at me now
got everyone around and we're shutting it down
no worries anymore , cause what we have in store
we about to get loud
got me walking on a runway , baby
cause i'm dressed to impress you , baby
it's not even my birthday , 1 a.m. on a thursday
we 'bout to get loud
baby , baby i just dropped to my knees
i don't wanna feel the lights off me
you can follow if you just trust me , woah , woah
baby , baby i just dropped to my knees
i don't wanna feel the lights off me
you can follow if you just trust me , woah , woah
tonight , we're on fire , you can't hide - let's roll , roll
tonight , you and i , we're aligned - let's roll , roll
i'm getting impatient , getting sick of waiting , you already know
tonight , we're on fire , you can't hide - let's roll , roll
now let's roll
now let's roll
baby , baby , just trust me
baby , baby , just trust me
baby , baby , just trust me , woah , woah
tonight , we're on fire , you can't hide - let's roll , roll
tonight , you and i , we're aligned - let's roll , roll
i'm getting impatient , getting sick of waiting , you already know
tonight , we're on fire , you can't hide - let's roll , roll
