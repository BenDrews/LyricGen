you and i , we were on to something
now i'm left with nothing at all
and i wanna hear your echo
got to be the name you call
every time i do it like that
turns out you'll crawl right back
don't wanna put your heart into cracks
love is not red , it's black
i love it , so what are we gonna do ?
your mind is running on
oh , i love it , so what are we gonna do ?
your mind is running on
you and i , we were on to something
now i'm left with nothing at all
and i wanna hear your echo
got to be the name you call
( whoa ! wanna hear your echo. wanna hear your echo. )
i see trouble and i know
every thing i do is one big show
even though you make me glow
i have to move on and grow
i love it , so what are we gonna do ?
your mind is running on
oh , i love it , so what are we gonna do ?
your mind is running on
you and i , we were on to something
now i'm left with nothing at all
and i wanna hear your echo
got to be the name you call
( whoa ! wanna hear your echo. wanna hear your echo. )
i love it , so what are we gonna do ?
your mind is running on
i love it , so what are we gonna do ?
your mind is running on
( whoa ! wanna hear your echo. wanna hear your echo. )
