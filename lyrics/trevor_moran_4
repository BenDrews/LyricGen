i've been tryna find when to cross the line
when it's okay to see the bright side
when it's okay to see the limelight
i be thinking in my bed , i be thinking in my bed
lot of things on my head , contemplating in my head
and if we gon' go steady , then we gon' go steady
let me know if you're ready , if you're ready
i be thinking in my bed , i be thinking in my bed
lot of things on my head , contemplating in my head
and if we gon' go steady , then we gon' go steady
let me know if you're ready
i wanna fly , but i just can't live without you
yeah , you make me cry , but i know that i just can't hurt you
i wanna fly ( oh )
i wanna fly ( oh )
i'm glad to call you mine
you're a one of a kind
let me cross that line
you know i'm gonna get there
to that other side
i be thinking in my bed , i be thinking in my bed
lot of things on my head , contemplating in my head
and if we gon' go steady , then we gon' go steady
let me know if you're ready , if you're ready
i be thinking in my bed , i be thinking in my bed
lot of things on my head , contemplating in my head
and if we gon' go steady , then we gon' go steady
let me know if you're ready
i wanna fly , but i just can't live without you
yeah , you make me cry , but i know that i just can't hurt you
i wanna fly ( oh )

on my way , on my way right now
to breakaway , breakaway right now
on my way , on my way right now
i wanna fly
i wanna fly , but i just can't live without you
yeah , you make me cry , but i know that i just can't hurt you
i wanna fly ( oh )
i wanna fly ( oh )
