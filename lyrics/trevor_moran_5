you already know , you already know
i'm coming after you , so you better go
you're losing control , you're losing control
i can see the coldness inside your soul
i can feel it now , i'm holding it down
and if you try to stop me , you'll never know how
you already know , you already know
i can see the coldness inside your soul
so sick of the games that you're playing
i don't really get it , i just tune you out
you're talking like you know your information
you should be ashamed of your shade right now
i thought he would be so kind
you thought i would be so blind
you're crazy with your state of mind
you're crazy with your state of mind
you already know , you already know
i'm coming after you , so you better go
you're losing control , you're losing control
i can see the coldness inside your soul
i can feel it now , i'm holding it down
and if you try to stop me , you'll never know how
you already know , you already know
i can see the coldness inside your soul
did you have to ruin what's created ?
once i get a chance , i'mma shut you down
why you gotta be so pretentious ?
you started from the bottom and you're here right now
i thought he would be so kind
you thought i would be so blind
you're crazy with your state of mind
you're crazy with your state of mind
you already know , you already know
i'm coming after you , so you better go
you're losing control , you're losing control
i can see the coldness inside your soul
i can feel it now , i'm holding it down
and if you try to stop me , you'll never know how
you already know , you already know
i can see the coldness inside your soul
i can see the coldness inside your soul
i can see the coldness inside your soul
you already know , you already know
i'm coming after you , so you better go
you're losing control , you're losing control
i can see the coldness inside your soul
i can feel it now , i'm holding it down
and if you try to stop me , you'll never know how
you already know , you already know
i can see the coldness inside your soul
