there's always been a need to get rid of this grief
it's what i call " xiat "
been in highs , been in lows
feel like there's nowhere to go
is there something wrong with me ?
trying to do normal things i used to pursue
so fired up , but now rotting inside
i do my hardest to break out of this shell
without a crack , i'm still stuck in this hell
whoa oh , i've been falling lately
thinking maybe life's just a merry - go - round
whoa oh , i've been thinking lately
thinking maybe life's just a merry - go - round
if there's an out i need a way , maybe an escape
i wanna be at top : grade a
been up , pushed down , face in the ground
i've been trying to find my way
trying to do normal things i used to pursue
so fired up , but now rotting inside
i do my hardest to break out of this shell
without a crack , i'm still stuck in this hell
whoa oh , i've been falling lately
thinking maybe life's just a merry - go - round
whoa oh , i've been thinking lately
thinking maybe life's just a merry - go - round
life's just a merry - go -
whoa oh , i've been falling lately
thinking maybe life's just a merry - go - round
whoa oh , i've been thinking lately
thinking maybe life's just a merry - go - round
life's just a merry - go -
x.i.a.t. - this is what describes me
x.i.a.t. - this is what describes me
x.i.a.t. , x.i.a.t. , x.i.a.t

whoa oh , i've been falling lately
thinking maybe life's just a merry - go - round
whoa oh , i've been thinking lately
thinking maybe life's just a merry - go - round
whoa oh , i've been falling lately
thinking maybe life's just a merry - go - round
whoa oh , i've been thinking lately
thinking maybe life's just a merry - go - round
life's just a merry - go - round
