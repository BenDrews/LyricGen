if you wanna get down tonight
baby , we just might
well , don't be scared , yeah
i'm right here , it's just me and you tonight
the night's going slower as i look over my shoulder
well i gotta leave and flee the scene
babe , i gotta hit the road
temptation in your eyes
betrayer in disguise
oh , i can say just go away before i lose my mind
temptation in your eyes
betrayer in disguise
just disappear right in the clear , i'll politely decline
i , oh i , i just wanna be alive , - live
i , oh i , i just wanna be alive , - live
not having lots of motivation on my mind , on my mind
i'm gonna have to come and conquer one more time , one more time
temptation in your eyes
betrayer in disguise
oh , i can say just go away before i lose my mind
temptation in your eyes
betrayer in disguise
just disappear right in the clear , i'll politely decline
i , oh i , i just wanna be alive , - live
i , oh i , i just wanna be alive , - live
temptation in your eyes
betrayer in disguise
oh , i can say just go away before i lose my mind
temptation in your eyes
betrayer in disguise
just disappear right in the clear , i'll politely decline
i , oh i , i just wanna be alive , - live
i , oh i , i just wanna be alive , - live
