it should be outlawed
what you can do to me
can't take me eyes off you
in too deep
you can't control who you love in your soul
there's a force that will pull you back again
oh , you can't control who you love in your soul
there's a force that will pull you back again
baby , i feel you pull me to the dark side
one look , and you control me from the inside
i'm just a puppet on your string
you can make me do anything ( oh )
baby , i feel you pull me to the dark side
you're like a monster
you're trying to swallow me
i'll never conquer you
you're all i need
you can't control who you love in your soul
there's a force that will pull you back again
oh , you can't control who you love in your soul
there's a force that will pull you back again
baby , i feel you pull me to the dark side
one look , and you control me from the inside
i'm just a puppet on your string
you can make me do anything ( oh )
love is a drug , is a drug
it makes you feel good , it makes you feel good
can't get enough , get enough
baby , i feel you pull me to the dark side
and you control me from the inside
i'm just a puppet on your string
you can make me do anything ( oh )
baby , i feel you pull me to the dark side
i feel you pull me to the dark side
