what if , what if we run away ?
what if , what if we left today ?
what if we said goodbye to safe and sound ?
and what if , what if we're hard to find ?
what if , what if we lost our minds ?
what if we let them fall behind and they're never found ?
and when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
and the stars exploding , we’ll be fireproof
my youth , my youth is yours
trippin' on skies , sippin' waterfalls
my youth , my youth is yours
runaway now and forevermore
my youth , my youth is yours
a truth so loud you can't ignore
my youth , my youth , my youth
my youth is yours
what if , what if we start to drive ?
what if , what if we close our eyes ?
what if we're speeding through red lights into paradise ?
cause we've no time for getting old
mortal body ; timeless souls
cross your fingers , here we go
and when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
and the stars exploding , we’ll be fireproof
my youth , my youth is yours
trippin' on skies , sippin' waterfalls
my youth , my youth is yours
runaway now and forevermore
my youth , my youth is yours
a truth so loud you can't ignore
my youth , my youth , my youth
my youth is yours
my youth , my youth is yours
trippin' on skies , sippin' waterfalls
my youth , my youth is yours
runaway now and forevermore
my youth , my youth is yours
a truth so loud you can't ignore
my youth , my youth , my youth
my youth is yours
my youth is yours
my youth is yours
