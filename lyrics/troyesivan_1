trying hard not to fall
on the way home
you were trying to wear me down , down
kissing up on fences
and up on walls
on the way home
i guess it’s all working out , now
‘cause there’s still too long to the weekend
too long till i drown in your hands
too long since i’ve been a fool
leave this blue neighbourhood
never knew loving could hurt this good
and it drives me wild
cause when you look like that
i’ve never ever wanted to be so bad
it drives me wild
you’re driving me wild , wild , wild
white noise in my mind
won’t calm down
you’re all i think about
running on the music
and night highs
but when the light’s out
it’s me and you now , now
‘cause there’s still too long to the weekend
too long till i drown in your hands
too long since i’ve been a fool
leave this blue neighbourhood
never knew loving could hurt this good
and it drives me wild
you make my heart shake
bend and break
but i can’t turn away
and it’s driving me wild
you’re driving me wild
you make my heart shake
bend and break
but i can’t turn away
and it’s driving me wild
you’re driving me wild
leave this blue neighbourhood
never knew loving could hurt this good
and it drives me wild
cause when you look like that
i’ve never ever wanted to be so bad
it drives me wild
