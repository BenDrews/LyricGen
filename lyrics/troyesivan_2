i am tired of this place , i hope people change
i need time to replace what i gave away
and my hopes , they are high , i must keep them small
though i try to resist i still want it all
i see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
i see a little house on the hill and children’s names
i see quiet nights poured over ice and tanqueray
but everything is shattering and it’s my mistake
only fools fall for you , only fools
only fools do what i do , only fools fall
only fools fall for you , only fools
only fools do what i do , only fools fall
oh , our lives don’t collide , i’m aware of this
we've got differences and impulses and your obsession with
the little things you like stick , and i like aerosol
i don’t give a fuck , i'm not giving up , i still want it all
only fools fall for you , only fools
only fools do what i do , only fools fall
only fools fall for you , only fools
only fools do what i do , only fools fall
i see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
i see a little house on the hill and children’s names
i see quiet nights poured over ice and tanqueray
but everything is shattering and it’s my mistake
only fools fall for you , only fools fall
only fools do what i do , only fools fall
only fools fall for you , only fools fall
only fools do what i do , only fools fall
only fools fall for you ( only fools )
only fools do what i do ( only fools )
only fools fall for you ( only fools )
only fools do what i do , only fools fall
( only fools )
( only fools )
( only fools )
( only fools )
