we are runnin' so fast
and we never look back
and whatever i lack
you make up
we make a really good team
and though not everyone sees
we got this crazy chemistry
between us
jump starting your car cause this city's a bore
buying e - cigarettes at the convenience store
making new clich√©s on our own little tour
let's ride
you don't have to say i love you to say i love you
forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
we've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
sickeningly sweet like honey , don't need money
all i need is you
all i need is you
we try staying up late
but we both are light weights
yeah we get off our face , too easy
and we take jokes way too far
and sometimes living's too hard
we're like two halves of one heart
you don't have to say i love you to say i love you
forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
we've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
sickeningly sweet like honey , don't need money
all i need is you
all i need is you
eat a pill , stay and chill , you don't need to go
i'm about to bring emo back if you leave my home
i'd panic at the disco and you'd rather watch a tv show
then i'll squeeze your booty real hard like i'm kneading dough
pizza boy , i'm speeding for ya
we canna get married tonight if you really wanna
me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer
and if you break this lil' heart , it'd be an honour
you don't have to say i love you to say i love you
forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
we've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
sickeningly sweet like honey , don't need money
all i need is you
all i need is you
