the truth runs wild
like a tear down a cheek
trying to save face , and daddy heart break
i'm lying through my teeth
this voice inside
has been eating at me
trying to replace the love that i fake
with what we both need
the truth runs wild
like kids on concrete
trying to sedate , my mind in its cage
and numb what i see
awake , wide eyed
i'm screaming at me
trying to keep faith and picture his face
staring up at me
without losing a piece of me
how do i get to heaven ?
without changing a part of me
how do i get to heaven ?
all my time is wasted
feeling like my heart's mistaken , oh
so if i'm losing a piece of me
maybe i don't want heaven ?
the truth runs wild
like the rain to the sea
trying to set straight the lines that i trace
to find some release
this voice inside
has been eating at me
trying to embrace the picture i paint
and colour me free
without losing a piece of me
how do i get to heaven ?
without changing a part of me
how do i get to heaven ?
all my time is wasted
feeling like my heart's mistaken , oh
so if i'm losing a piece of me
maybe i don't want heaven ?
so i'm counting to fifteen
counting to fifteen , counting to fifteen
so i'm counting to fifteen
counting to fifteen , counting to fifteen
without losing a piece of me
how do i get to heaven ?
without changing a part of me
how do i get to heaven ?
all my time is wasted
feeling like my heart's mistaken , oh
so if i'm losing a piece of me
maybe i don't want heaven ?
