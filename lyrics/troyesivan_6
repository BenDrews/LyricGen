i wanna sleep next to you
but that's all i wanna do right now
and i wanna come home to you
but home is just a room full of my safest sounds
cause you know that i can't trust myself with my 3am shadow
i'd rather fuel a fantasy than deal with this alone
i wanna sleep next to you
but that's all i wanna do right now
so come over now and talk me down
i wanna hold hands with you
but that's all i wanna do right now
and i wanna get close to you
cause your hands and lips still know their way around
and i know i like to draw the line when it starts to get too real
but the less time that i spend with you , the less you need to heal
i wanna sleep next to you
but that's all i wanna do right now
so come over now and talk me down
( talk me down )
so if you don't mind , i'll walk that line
stuck on the bridge between us
gray areas and expectations
but i'm not the one if we're honest , yeah
but i wanna sleep next to you
and i wanna come home to you
i wanna hold hands with you
i wanna be close to you
but i wanna sleep next to you
and that's all i wanna do right now
and i wanna come home to you
but home is just a room full of my safest sounds
so come over now and talk me down
( talk me down )
