i'm down to my skin and bone
and my mommy , she can't put down the phone
and stop asking how i'm doing all alone , alone
but the truth is the stars are falling , ma
and the wolves are out c - calling , ma
and my home has never felt this far
but all this driving
is driving me crazy
and all this moving
is proving to get the best of me
and i've been trying to hide it
but lately
every time i think i'm better
pickin' my head up , getting nowhere
take me back to the basics and the simple life
tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
your touch , my comfort , and my lullaby
holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
now i'm down to my skin and bones
my baby listens to me on the phone
but i can't help feeling like i'm all alone , all alone
the truth is , the stars are falling , babe
and i'd never ever thought that i would say
i'm afraid of the life that i've made , i've made
but all this driving
is driving me crazy
and all this moving
is proving to get the best of me
and i've been trying to hide it
but lately
every time i think i'm better
pickin' my head up , getting nowhere
take me back to the basics and the simple life
tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
your touch , my comfort , and my lullaby
holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
i've been lyin' to them all
i don't need it anymore
don't you worry about me
i'll be fine if i can breathe
i've been out here for too long
taking shit for how i'm wrong
how i'm wrong
always wrong
take me back to the basics and the simple life
tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
your touch , my comfort , and my lullaby
holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
( take me back to the basics and the simple life )
holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
( tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease )
holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
( your touch , my comfort , and my lullaby )
holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
