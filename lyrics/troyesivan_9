sweet life living
pools and swimming
drinks in bars and
boys in cars and
rooftop sinning
skinny dipping
shooting stars with you
fat cigars and
and that weekend up in the islands
they stop and stare
flashes filling the silence
of a hollywood love affair
waking up in the islands
cause i saw you there
lost and trying to be
i was just trying to be cool
i was just trying to be like you
i'm a spark and you're a boom
what am i supposed to do ?
mansion debut
love it , do you ?
absent father
pays his daughter
and her mama withdrew
from the life they once knew
she had a heart
but she sold it off for
and that weekend up in the islands
they stop and stare
flashes filling the silence
of a hollywood love affair
waking up in the islands
cause i saw you there
lost and trying to be
i was just trying to be cool
i was just trying to be like you
i'm a spark and you're a boom
what am i supposed to do ?
when i've got that cigarette smoke
and saint laurent coat , but nothing is feeling right
i drink but i choke
i love but i don't
i was just trying to be cool
i was just trying to be like you
i was just trying to be cool
i was just trying to be like you
i'm a spark and you're a boom
what am i supposed to do ?
when i've got that cigarette smoke
and saint laurent coat , but nothing is feeling right
i drink but i choke
i love but i don't , yeah !
i was just trying to be cool
i was just trying to be like you
i'm a spark and you're a boom
what am i supposed to do ?
