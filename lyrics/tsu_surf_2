from the cocaine paradise , brick city
newark , waddup !
they thought i wasn't comin' back
rest in peace to newark , man
shotgun , waddup ?
i'm from a cocaine paradise , a heroin city where
gang members , fake niggas , snake bitches—plenty there
loyalty is really rare , you could die anywhere
mac's clap , clips rip , automatic semis flare
fuckers want you gone , gotta live with your gun
niggas'll die for they set but won't live for they son
got time for they bitches , show neglect to they daughter
ain't beefin' for work so they get it by the quarter
see the dark clouds cover us , no gettin' out for some of us
if you ain't know better you'd think god didn't fuck with us
little bit of money so the whips got 'em hatin'
gotta watch for the phonies and the fake salamu alaykum's
a lot of questions unanswered and we don't know why
nigga 12 years old throwin' his gang in the sky
i don't judge him , i don't judge him
that could be my lil cousin
told him , he don't live for somethin' , he could die for nothin'
i can still hear the shots fired , screams in my head
got a " rest in peace daddy " tat—he ain't even dead !
left us thinkin' these immature ways got mommy hurtin'
and these triple stacked pills got tsunami surfin'
scrape up the rent money , gotta get diapers
when i'm sittin' downstate , playin' monopoly with lifers
been a shooter since a kid , i'm hittin' 9 out of 9
jail taught me one thing : out of sight , out of mind
lil' rel wanted to ball , but jay - jay popped him
kesha got kids , but dyfs done got them
reek was out robbin' , but reek done got ten
the king had a dream and you see they shot him
so i'ma grind 'til i'm a victim of a homicide
but i'll be damned another man make momma cry
two of yours , one of mine : somebody gotta die
.40 cal baarracckkk ! i'm lettin' that obama fly
cold sweat nightmares , dreams from a bad book
they ain't really bangin' , they just likin' how them flags look
play the corner like champ out in denver
flip keys by the season , january 'til december
got max in the summer , tall cans in the winter
see them turtle niggas snitchin'
‘cause they runnin' with the splinters
i been nice since , street lights , curfews
nick at nite , pillow fights , rugrats , urkels
the ones that know you the best , the ones that'll hurt you
protect me from the squares and i'll handle my circle
i'm out ridin' for the team , boy , it's dinner time
heart of a leo , them twin 40's geminis
clip on maximum , this block'll get minimized
hood what i stand for , pain what i symbolize
100 round double grip , shotgun drivin'
add a few slugs and i'll divide the whole problem
the niggas that be talkin' ain't the ones ridin'
early morning kitchen whippin' , i ain't makin' omelettes
fuck the police , see , i'm just bein' honest
think he runnin' from me ? shit , he better be sonic
true trap star , connect front thirty birds
‘cause he know i'm matt ryan with them dirty birds
time to get it crackin' , chopper make that " prattt " sound
men in black flash : i'll clean this whole background
got enough for all nine lives , lay a cat down
aaron rodgers on the field : can't let my pack down
not my daughter , not my mother , not my fuckin' hood
would they kill me if they could ? yeah , they fuckin' would
i was young and fell in love with the strip
man , this hood a dirty broad , i'm still fuckin' with the bitch
see , if i don't make it out ? cool , i'ma die here
‘cause i bang , ‘cause i trap and i ride here
pussy , money , weed , dead bodies what they find here
good wherever i'm at , i'm feelin' like lebron here
tell them niggas come get me , i'll be waitin' on 'em
two rondos , mask like jason on 'em
hood been sleepin' on him , niggas been hatin' on him
tim duncan with the bread ; surf been bankin' on 'em
any problems , man , that gauge will clap
maybe they'll love me when i fade to black—tsunami !
