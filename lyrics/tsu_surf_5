light a blunt and see visions while i'm recordin'
long nights and early mornings , rain sleet , shit , it was pourin'
i was grinding , they was yawnin'
some of them was still snorin'
had the black and silver 9's , but couldn't afford jordans
alright , alright , believe in upstairs
down here some sinning happen
tried to move e's , the result of that was sending 'matics
bright lights , big bangs
mobbing to that old dedication , that real wayne
however many the truck fit deep
you die in your dreams , you die for real
so the pills kill the sleep
sun coming up , we still wide - eyed
and couldn't tell my brother shit when his mom died
swore i had all the answers till that night
he said they gotta fix it , they'll bring her back , right ?
wrong , some found a better way , some lost
wonder what you got to lose to win , and at what cost
you don't believe in god , tell me what you see then
there's gotta be something that you believe in
i hate to ( ? ? ) , but it's made me strong
hardest money to be made , i'm just trying to make it all
tell me what to do , tell me what i need
how to be a man , and succeed
show me the reason , the reason to be
optimistic 'bout life , with pessimistic dreams
i stand out , why would i work hard to fit in between ?
why would i kill your rook when i could kill your queen ?
cool with my castle , fuck a ring , with a different team
see , i'd lose with them before i win with y'all
love that nigga , shit , i'd die for my nigga fall
anticipating the worst that could possibly come from sinnin'
i know what we doing wrong
but chillin' seem wrong when you winnin'
who's the judge ? man , we all wildin'
telly stravie's with my bitches from out long island
they get it for the low , they drop it lower
sound like a plug to me so i got to know her
wonder if the buzz got 'em chirping
or the swag got him twerking , or the pills got him working
or the hate got him lurking , or maybe i am perfect
shit , or maybe i am perfectâ€¦ till we find out , i just nod out
rap & drugs , praying i don't amy winehouse
till we find out , i just nod out
rap & drugs , praying i don't amy winehouse
i could take you through my troubles , shit be too real
xannies or mollys be like red pill or blue pill ( matrix ! )
can't see shit until you look close
didn't think twice , didn't blink , shit , i took both
long nights up equals long day sleep
stomach for my team , i ain't full if they ain't eat
i'd die just thinking of my downfall
them square niggas rule 1 , stay from around y'all
they pray for me , i pray for the haters
just waiting on that check , please , somebody call the waiter
just blew another quarter , bitches think i'm changin'
just copped another nickel , still down for sprayin'
if i had a penny for every dime bag
i could cop a whole dime bag
if i had a penny for every dime bag i'd cop a whole dime bag
