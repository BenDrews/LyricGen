broken dreams lost in the night
pieces fallin’ , pick ‘em up again
if i don’t win i swear i’ll die trying
die trying
this long term shit real , check my motherfucking résumé
while they was getting fly , i was trying to levitate
dabble through my catalogue , and after all you better say
i done keep it funky from the jump , but it doesn’t stank
and that might not register with he or her
who doesn’t think , who doesn’t think he hasn’t earned
his spot in history without a body burned
it’s not that i’m an alchemist but i can turn
any metal into gold , nothing into something
and when it feels like hell , i know that heaven’s close
and it ain’t up for debate so change the subject
sometimes i feel more awake with my eyes closed
everybody needs somethin’
they see my show and it’s sold out
wrists rocky , so the money i still loan out
niggas buggin’ out , need an exterminator
i leave your body covered in chrome ; the terminator
i’ll change a hater’s concerns to be concerned with paper
then he’ll produce like erik sermon , hear the sermon later
for now , i read they comments , i browse
supreme , i’m on my taxes , i’m rasing they eyebrows
you might be jumping out the window ; ron browz
coming at me simple with my style , nah
broken dreams led to fixed realities
i was trained like the santa fe , fatality
i’m lost dreamin' , the walls screamin’ , see y’all demons
room spinning in hell and sin , what y’all breathin’ ?
precautious paranoia keep me boxed in
and i ain’t lock a soul out , i got locked in
blunt of loud to make light of my current fame
current game , trio trippin' me molly in this current day
overseas women , i’m sinnin’ , but that’s a current change
still got a shot ; steve kerr at range
no bullshit , you a victim at this current range
wonder when i thrashed the concept that i was insane , or that them and i was the same. block full of candles , seen what’s - his - names turn to " what’s his name ? "
closet full of problems that’s irrelevant by every bid
layin’ next to the skeletons in the evidence
