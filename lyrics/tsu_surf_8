'em dollar signs , why i get this shit straight
i was raised by guns and 'kiss mixtapes
trap or die , goddamn , that's a sick fate
learn from the best so i stretch when i flip weight
see , you could lose a lot chasing bitches
but you never lose bitches with your eyes on the riches
paper cuts on my fingers , razor cuts on the dishes
red bag , blue stamps , so the dope say clippers
and don't plan on eating if you not with us
i send shooters for the green ; i'm so doc rivers
niggas mad , cops hate , they cannot get us
bricks by the burr , i can make the hole block shiver
every night re - up , days all flip
dead presidents ; i'm trappin' on the graveyard shift
i can see , smell , taste me a dollar sign
he outta line , that whole block getting columbine'd
no offence , you not eating if you not with mine
they say i run this whole strip ; i'm the power line
toast to the niggas that's a fiend for the guap
and send a shot to every cop that's tryin' to jenga the block
niggas die for this life , shit , believe it or not
the og's planted seeds , meet the cream of the crop
see , niggas rob , niggas steal , niggas snitch for it
some pray , some dream , some wish for it
kids turn men , men turn bitch for it
bush went to war , alpo killed rich for it
i'm looking at this world we call life
tryin' to turn something pretty into a girl i call wife
but i might just go and find something for the night
got a couple days left , so i guess it's only right
all the hating ass thoughts , you can keep those
whole team turnt , shit , we surfin' till the beach closed
momma say i'm changing , i think she right
i text shorty " let's fuck " , i think she might
i'm learning how to live in the game
and i swear i'm going crazy , but the ends keep me sane
please don't judge me by the flag , or the swag
or the tats , or the team , or the hood , or the habits
or these slick ways , and this probably concealed ratchet
‘cause i'm cool , but never ever hesitate to clap it
they say " wife her ! " , i say , " what's the point when
y'all friends and you seen as many tats as her boyfriend ? "
i don't love her , i don't love her on my mother
and her name ain't pants , so why should i cuff her ?
difference between us , well , a lot of shit
grind hard , paper stack ; this is what i gotta get
coke , weed , cd's – i'm making all kind of flips
black and silver spur speedin' , bitches screamin' , " popovich ! "
i guess i'm tony parker in that damn thing
three , threes , straight , crowd jump and then the band scream
spent 40 , so 60 what i'm looking at
jersey shore white girl ; i'm giving out snooki packs
hit the mall , blow bands till the guap gone
been making movies , this just butter on the popcorn
beach swag , but i move a little goonish
ain't the cutest nigga she seen , but damn sure the coolest
surf's up , anything else foolish
actually this turquoise look a little blue - ish
dolphin got me flippin' through the city
cîroc boy for real , man , somebody call diddy
do you dig me ? she got a nice ass and some titties
go to school upstate , but got a condo in the city
from the hood , but my bitches on the upscale
grown shit , got her pinned up without the thumbnail
so what you doing with your life watching me ?
you know what niggas doing with your wife ?
time is money , that means it's time to go though
catch another plane flight , add another show though
triple stacks , got this life looking so slow - mo
surf's up , don't forget the hoe though
