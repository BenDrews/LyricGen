one time for the niggas that see my vision clear
â€˜cause we ain't watching it in the movies , we was livin' there
kitchen full of plastic shit , room full of silver wear
shit way better now , but i still care
told momma we would make it , shit , we makin' it
these dope lines , i'm just tryin' to get to the base of it
ridin' by myself , smokin' something loud
thinking of some shit beyond life , like grandmama proud
who would've thought we would've made it past
most of them jail cells and shoot outs ?
this a game we wasn't 'posed to win
them snake hoes still rattle when you close to them
i gotta let it out , i'm tryin' to hold it in
take a flight across the world , that's a nice nap
then gotta land in the hood , and come right back
to the fake friends , the phony hoes
to the leprechauns feeling like you owe 'em gold
but i love this place like i love my mother
love that thing on my waist like i love my brother
ironic , the crazier the bitch , the more you love her
so when the hood open her arms , what you do but hug her ?
most prayers sent don't make it up around here
survival's first , getting out is like a plus around here
you ever been addicted ?
hustle hustle , got quotas for christmas ?
my daughter wrote " my daddy freedom " on top of the wish list
preachers scream we street demons , and they need us out
no telling where i'm headed
but it damn sure ain't the scenic route
man , this strap ain't for showin'
some niggas come and some go , and
if they comin' i'm throwin' everything that i'm holdin'
my heart colder then a frozen aisle
niggas came through shooting , god chose a child
and i won't question his reasons
but momma standing there screamin'
and daddy booked for some seasons
karma's still going 'round
a lot of lost souls on these back blocks
bangers , junkies , crack rock ; watch out for the matlock
you're nobody until somebody kill you
you're nobody until somebody kill you
