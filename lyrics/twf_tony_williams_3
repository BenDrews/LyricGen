girl i wanna show you a unique feature
down in every man lives a two headed creature
if you don't know that this is true
well darling it do , it's the king and the fool
now it all depends which approach you appeal with
the one you pick that's the one you gon' deal with
ooh i hope you feel this
you know i'm only talking real shit
i'll show you a game
you're in school
only two plays
just one rule
think before you raise
think before you move
you want the king or the fool
ante up baby
first you wanna lead
grab your cards on the dealer
know what you need
drop your trump like it's fever
got all you could , the necessary tools
now get a clue to king or the fool
i'll show you the way baby , i'm on your team
now watch him play , he's coming back with the queen
now you're living love supreme
he'll buy you bling , got your ring
flying off to far away , places you ain't never seen
just a playing partner , ain't trying to be a preacher
the more i watch girl i really need to teach ya
if you say no , i will assume
you know the rules , the king or the fool
there ain't nothing hard , i ain't trying to make it seem
but one mistake it could really get obscene
sure to see the tables swing
it's looking mean , patience lean
you don't hear me when i see it
girl i swear i gotta see
