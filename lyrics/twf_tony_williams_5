heard you found a new shiny treasure
tell me what is true
everyone says you can do better and it
tears me right in two
it's more than a want
girl i need you
it's more than a want
girl i'll please you
give me one more time , i'll make you mine
don't want no drama late at night
sugar one more time , i'll make you mine
mama , the way you do , you got me thinkin i'll
i'll do ya , do ya , do ya girl , you're so good baby
( you're so good , you're so good )
i'll do ya , do ya , do ya girl
( you're so good , you're so good )
i'll do ya , do ya , do ya girl , you're so good baby
( you're so good , you're so good )
i'll do ya , do ya , do ya girl
was it just an innocent moments crush
was it much too much
or was it never nothin there at all ?
i just want to feel your touch
baby , i know what i feel
and baby , i know that it's real
you know i'm blinded , baby , look i'm flyin' , baby
bout to jump without a parachute to be with you
now i'm drownin' , baby , only you can save me
it's more than a want , girl i need you
more than a want , sugar i plead you
you're so good , you're so good
