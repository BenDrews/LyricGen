" i think you're on to something scoob "
i remember days when i use to stay at the days inn

i need a vacation

i'm chasing these dreams
i keep the high beams
cause my future is bright
turn on the lights
i just copped the cement 3's in white
i'm jack black , and i snort white
kung fu panda
i remember when i was poe , like allen
edgar , frankie , fuck rats , no master splinter
i keep the shredder , go ham , chasing cheddar
the rap game tiago splitter , i split the rello
i grind the nuggets , like carmello
im high like mellow , i bring the hype
im on skype , roll the dice , yahtzee
free mason ; crosby , i'm not a nazi
i'm the white bill cosby , chasing cash like johnny
in all black , black shades , johnny cage or nick , st. nick
im sick , and i spit like i got aids , but i don't , i get financial
your bullshit is substantial
can you skip to the next stanza ?

my deceased uncle , i will never forget your chuckle
crack my knuckles like sonic , the hedgehog , hegemony
shout out to joseph no kony , fuck sony
my bitch wears a halo , jerod mayo
bite the mango , alpha , tango , romero
athletic training , stain the glass
bong rips for the nightcap
i want caps and stems , fuck math and chem
i got more gems then spyro or ash , cattch'em
pass the legacy and the ash catcher , like harrold
i have no merritt or morals
coldblooded check my dorsil fin , i'm here to win
windex and bong rips , clean that shit , like manure
i should know , i'm a piece of shit , she got the manicure for free
free guwop , 39 months is too much , like a drake song
nothing was the same , but not much has changed
except the dime bags , i keep the quarter
pass the sage , i'm not a mage , i am a sorcer
the torch burns , so does the lighter
highly flammable like the hindenburg , heisenburg
i got that walter white , rowdy roddy i don't touch the white
running down the sidelines , till i slip and slide into the end zone
after this i promise i will not get slept on , ever again
feather in hat , heather in hand , whoop ass in a can
cookin' up beats on fruity loops , tucan sam , uncle sam
can kiss my ass , if he thinks i will not distribute
fine art institue , substitute , the only teachers i have are golden
i'm from the upper echelon , not a goalie , i do not defend
i only win , like ma$e do , i keep the jackson's , samuel , adams , light the l
you don't need hockey sticks to see hell , after this they goin' feel me like brail
check the mail , stamp return to sender , mortal kombat finish her , fatality , assault
