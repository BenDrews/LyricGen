you were that whiskey running through my veins
you were that first sweet taste of mary jane
all alone in the darkness watching my hands shake
but they don’t have a rehab for heartbreak
it’s your blue sundress with the strap falling off of your shoulder
it’s that all night moonlight drive , you saying baby pull over , pull over
it’s that long kiss barely coming up for air
had to have you anytime and everywhere
so hooked on you probably never get clean and sober
whoa , i bang my head against the moon
i bang my fist against the wall
you always used to get me high
now all i do is crash and fall
i’m going through withdrawals
i’m going through withdrawals
i’m going through withdrawals
yeah you got me going through ‘em
it’s the rain on the window with your body wrapped tight around me
it's that lightning flash in your eyes make me want you so badly , madly
you’re the ghost that’s still sleeping in my bed
a song i can’t turn off in my head
you’re the perfect storm , yeah baby , and i’m still drowning
whoa , i bang my head against the moon
i bang my fist against the wall
you always used to get me high
now all i do is crash and fall
i’m going through withdrawals
i’m going through withdrawals
i’m going through withdrawals
yeah you got me going through ‘em
i’m going through withdrawals
i’m going through withdrawals , yeah
i bang my head against the moon
i bang my fist against the wall
you always used to get me high
now all i do is crash and fall
i’m going through withdrawals
i’m going through withdrawals
i’m going through withdrawals
i’m going through withdrawals
i’m going through withdrawals
i’m going through withdrawals
yeah you got me going through ‘em
