you’re drivin’ back home down 246
you almost hit a deer and you end up in a ditch
you can’t pull forward and you can’t back out
you’re sittin’ there thinkin’ whatcha gonna do now
you’d be a little nervous if a cop showed up
‘cause you drank a little maybe just a little too much
waitin’ on a tow truck takes too long
it’s two in the mornin’…who you gonna call
friends…damn good friends
seven minutes later they’re pullin’ you out
you know the ones i’m talkin’ about
friends…damn good friends
you can count ‘em all on one of your hands
you got a hundred buddies
a couple of damn good friends
so you’re all shootin’ pool on a saturday night
this little brunette keeps givin’ you the eye
so you buy her a drink , before too long
you’re out on the floor in the middle of a song
about that time her ex shows up
he’s starin’ you down getting’ all bowed up
he’s a big ol’ jacked up s.o.b
that’s alright he’s about to meet your…
friends…damn good friends
a few seconds later he’s startin’ to see
it ain’t one on one…it’s one on three
friends…damn good friends
they do it for you ‘cause you’d do it for them
you got a hundred buddies
but a couple of damn good friends
they’re there even when you don’t see ‘em as much
cause you moved away or you fell in love
but they’re wearin’ a tux when you’re sayin’ your vows
and if you crash and burn you can crash on their couch
friends…damn good friends
they love you like a brother there ain’t no doubt
you know the ones i’m talkin’ about
friends…damn good friends
you can count ’em all on one of your hands
you got a hundred buddies
and a couple of damn good friends
oh damn good friends
