girl you know i love this town , lived here all my life
right up ‘til you left me , figured this would be where i’d die
now i’m thinkin’ ‘bout a u - haul , selling everything i can’t haul
get a load of you off my chest move out west , maybe utah
find a little cabin in the hills , in the middle of nowhereville
irish setter , my old guitar , 22 rifle , and a rod and reel
read that bible mama gave me
maybe stumble on some words to save me
think i’d really like the sound of a mountain breeze
and being somewhere where i can suffer in peace
saw you last saturday and i just about lost my cool
you were sittin’ in his car at the tiger mart by our old high school
back to square one again , gettin’ over you over again
girl i need to be somewhere else , ‘cause i don’t trust myself around you and him
i’m thinkin’ cabin in the hills , in the middle of nowhereville
an irish setter , my old guitar , a 22 rifle , and a rod and reel
thumb through that bible mama gave me
maybe stumble on some words to save me
you know i’d really like the sound of a mountain breeze
and being somewhere where i can suffer in peace
no tv , no telephone
hang this heartache on a rainbow
and find a little cabin in the hills , in the middle of nowhereville
my irish setter , an old guitar , 22 rifle , and a rod and reel
thumb through that bible mama gave me
maybe stumble on some words to save me
you know i’d really like the sound of a mountain breeze
and being somewhere where i can suffer in peace
i can suffer in peace
suffer in peace
