yeah , you know i love you in a tight dress
but you’re , oh my god , slippin’ out of it
you turn me on , girl you know you do
but you tear me up even better in boots
we ain’t gotta worry ‘bout gettin’ dirty
we can do whatever we want
baby put your luccheses on
you know you want to
‘cause we got a full moon
and it’s friday night
girl you got me so hooked
ain’t nothin’ ever looked better in boots
fair , girl it ain’t even fair
when all it takes is you lettin’ down your hair
to drive me wild like you know you do
it works every time but even better in boots
we ain’t gotta worry ‘bout gettin’ dirty
we can do whatever we want
baby put your luccheses on
you know you want to
‘cause we got a full moon
and it’s friday night
girl you got me so hooked
ain’t nothin’ ever looked better in boots
we ain’t gotta worry ‘bout gettin’ dirty
we can do whatever we want
baby put them luccheses on
you know you want to
‘cause we got a full moon
and it’s friday night
girl you got me so hooked
ain’t nothin’ ever looked better in boots
girl you got me so hooked
ain’t nothin’ ever looked better in them boots
