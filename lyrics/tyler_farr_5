the joke's on me and it ain't funny
everybody but me could see the punch line coming
a mile away
i've heard it so many times i can tell it
to the t , believe me i could sell it
all day
it goes...
a guy walks into a bar , orders a drink
sees a girl that catches his eye
asks her if she wants another
they fall for each other and end up lovers
they laugh , cry , hold on tight
make it work for a little while
then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
and a guy walks into a bar
i'd laugh too if my heart would let me
keeping it light will probably help to get me
over you
i'm walking , talking , drinking proof
a clich√© in a corner booth
ain't nothing new
sees a girl that catches his eye
asks her if she wants another
they fall for each other and end up lovers
they laugh , cry , hold on tight
make it work for a little while
then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
and a guy walks into a bar
sees a girl that catches his eye
asks her if she wants another
they fall for each other and end up lovers
they laugh , cry , hold on tight
make it work for a little while
then one night her taillights fade out into the dark
and a guy walks into a bar
