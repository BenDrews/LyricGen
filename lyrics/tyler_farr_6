been on this binge for way too long
ain’t been sober since you’ve been gone
they say this time i’m in too deep
there’s a man in the mirror but it ain't me
here i am getting tore up on a tuesday
sittin’ here lettin’ her get to me
tryin’ to make the pain and another one disappear
i oughta be dialin’ up her number
sayin’ i’m sorry can i come over
makes me wonder what the hell i’m doin’ here
i don’t even want this beer
i wonder if she’s alone tonight
thinkin’ bout all i didn’t do right
or is she out on the town in my favorite dress
with some ole boy tryin’ his best
to get her buzzin’ just enough that she might say yes
and here i am getting tore up on a tuesday
sittin’ here lettin’ her get to me
tryin’ to make the pain and another one disappear
i oughta be dialin’ up her number
sayin’ i’m sorry can i come over
makes me wonder what the hell i’m doin’ here
i don’t even want this beer
don’t want this high
all i want is you tonight yeah
here i am getting tore up on a tuesday
sittin’ here lettin’ her get to me
tryin’ to make the pain and another one disappear
i oughta be dialin’ up her number
sayin’ i’m sorry can i come over
makes me wonder what the hell i’m doin’ here
i don’t even want this beer
i don’t even want this beer
