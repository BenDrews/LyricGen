i thought i had it locked up tight , had the only key to my life
thought i built the walls up high enough
i was king of the neon lights , wore the crown on friday nights
i was winning the losing fight ‘til you showed up , yeah
you kicked my door in and stole my heart away and
took all my lonely nights and ran off with my bad days
girl you didn’t leave nothing but the wonderful
you’re a beautiful criminal
how’d you get away with this , i thought it was just a kiss
i ain’t been the same since you laid it on me
yeah baby you wrecked this place with just a smile on your pretty face
it’s all changed didn’t leave a trace of the old me , baby
you kicked my door in and stole my heart away and
took all my lonely nights and ran off with my bad days
girl you didn’t leave nothing but the wonderful
you’re a beautiful criminal , yeah
you’re a criminal
so take it all girl , i won’t stop you
oh and i’m so glad that i caught you , now i got you
you kicked my door in and stole my heart away
took all my lonely nights and ran off with my bad days
you didn’t leave nothing but the wonderful
you’re a beautiful criminal
