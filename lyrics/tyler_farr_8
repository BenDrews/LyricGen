got an alright house and a pretty nice yard
a screen door dog that stays on guard
got a buddy up the road that’s got my back
‘round here it ain’t hard to find folks like that
got a gun and a bible by my bed
try to live by the words in red
i ain't got a lot but i got enough
by god i believe in god we trust
that’s why , why we live here
damn right we ain’t going anywhere
home of the brave , baseball , and cold beer
it’s pretty clear
that’s why we live here
right now there’s a man serving overseas
seeing things he wished he didn’t see
picture of his wife tucked in his vest
fighting a fight we ain’t finished yet
that’s why , why we live here
damn right we ain’t going anywhere
home of the brave , baseball , and cold beer
it’s pretty clear
that’s why we live here , yeah
whether your road is dirt or paved
red , white , and blue , we’re all the same
that’s why , why we live here
you damn right we ain’t going anywhere
home of the brave , baseball , and ice cold beer
it’s pretty clear
that’s why we live here
