when i get down on my luck i hide behind my eyes in hollywood
they say ain't what you know but who you know
you need to know someone to know no one
when i get down on my luck
i roll one up and roll around all by my lonesome
lost some years , i used to know
i know my fate like bullets in a shotgun
when i get down on my luck i hide behind my eyes in hollywood
they say ain't what you know but who you know
you need to know someone to know no one
when i get down on my luck
i roll one up and roll around all by my lonesome
lost some years , i used to know
i know my fate like bullets in a shotgun
she loves to dream , living in and off and out her mind
in space and time , she takes a line & lies her life
away you might just say she stays to go nowhere
midnight scenes from an old romantic movie
usually you'd be there today i say was different
i can take you with me wondering , if you wanna go there
down on my luck
down on my luck
do you think about the things you say you don't ?
i know you do , white wine she over cool
ooh look at you , look at you
do you think the things you do or who you know ?
cause they told you to , why you listen to 'em ?
hands up , middle finger to 'em
fuck that , get down
