to get you what you need
make you love it , make you want it
cause baby you are so amazing
pack the bong , pack the bong , pack the bong , pack it
i'm pacquiao on the track , flow the tempo you should tap it
tap out or black out , black is beautiful say yes indeed
leave my demons in the dust , conducting electricity
i'm silkk the shocker with a fifth of vodka
bag of drugs in my knickerbockers
bach on the staff sheet , trying to pen an opera
sounds so beautiful
fogging my bifocals window shopping at the gucci store
know when you want it , but just can't have it
especially as an artist , don't that shit make you mad
just breathe , breathe , breathe , it's all in your head
know these labels wanna sign me for an arm and a leg
cut my publishing in half like i have to fold ( origami )
for a dollar , what's a half of a half a whole
quarter water or courvoisier , complicate things
when money's what you conversate , but this is just so that you know
hold up , hold up , hold up , yo wait up
wait up , i'mma let you finish
but finna be famous one day just really ain't where i fit in
fell in love when i was fifteen
i guess you could call it tennis
my tendency for this music
is so much deeper than business
i build a beat in the morning
record it before the evening
why is it what seems important
seems always to be misleading
i wish i could see the future
just wish i could see the future
tell me everything be okay just like my momma used to
my youths unfolding before me
be twenty before i know it
i'm trying to write my illmatic
get tvs that's panoramic
was riding around in a rental
and i don't mean it was rented
totalled my momma's prius , i vaguely remember spinning
i fell asleep from the studio , must've been saved cause no one hit me
they made a list about chicago rappers and they skipped me
maybe because i'm so much more
forget what you not , this is about what you are
