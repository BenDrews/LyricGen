yeah , this just my life
front to back , top to bottom
everything's changing around me
these days don't feel the same
we all lost faith and lost family
why must we play this game ?
lord have mercy on me
i've been a sinning man
pull out my wings , jump off the bridge
and crash in a plane , if i never land
know i never die
we live forever in my mind
and i sanctify
we live forever , still alive
there's a lot going on but i stick to the ones i love
i never claimed to be a perfect man but name a great man who was
consequences of my actions in the past years had me stressing out
it was like , may , i just moved to l.a. , i was tryna figure it out
medication for depression that i cut cold turkey , had the kid manic
in an episode out in hollywood , wilding out like nick cannon
railing adderall pills out a dollar bill , on the bathroom floor
clean the whole mess up with my nose , what the fuck i need a vacuum for ?
new york city on my birthday , june 6th , 2014
i had that first meeting with hov , plus i brought out the whole team
i drank that whole bottle of d'usse ty ty gave me that night
when we left the club , at the rap genius house me and shorty got into a fight
she came out the room swingin' , hit me in the jaw
i was really tryna fend her off
but i ended up in the closet with my hands around her neck
i was tripping , dawg
too proud to apologize or empathize , i blamed it all on her
saying that she hit me first , even though she was the one hurt
i was really just reflecting all the hurt that i was feeling from the band's rejection
when kids these days split , that shit felt like a c - section
and my infidelity and jealousy with natalie on top of the amphetamines
and the ecstasy had me tryna drown face down in the chesapeake
the next month i dropped " down on my luck " and had europe going nuts
but i couldn't even appreciate it at the time , i was going through too much
now i had to leverage million dollar label deals on the table for my records
in ibiza eating paella on the roof , tryna choose over breakfast
hov wasn't with the bidding war , but i knew the roc just felt right
when i saw kanye at wireless , without t - pain , still a good life
felt so close when mr. hudson introduced me to him backstage
he prolly don't even remember that shit... like a bitch off backpage
but at that stage , i was ready to swing for the fence like a batting cage
at the same time , i was winding down a low point in my addict phase
the adderall started wearing off and i went into a deep writer's block
all over a song that i couldn't finish that i wrote about signin' to the roc
isn't that ironic ? i was feeling so psychotic
with the whole world excited for me and my idol saying i got it
shit got bad out in l.a. , so i moved back home to my mom's basement
linked up with smoko and papi beatz and took it back to basics
then i wrote " rage , " that was me screaming out through the pain
and " u mad , " addressing my relationship with natalie , it was too bad
the violence and the lies slipped suicide into my mental health
i did acid in the studio one day and almost killed myself
as i started to fall apart , certain stars started to align
om'mas came to chicago in january at the perfect time
he said kanye was working on an album , and uzi played him one of our songs
he was tryna fly me out , nigga , it was goin' down like the dow jones
pulled up to westlake , first day i was there , i recorded " wolves "
i knew i was the one , like neo meeting with the oracle
but i had to get a handle 'fore the door was pulled
crawled out on snl
all the niggas hating on me back home lookin' at me like , " fml "
a lot of people coming out the wood like , " let's work , " tryna network
all the pressure making my head hurt , the molly wouldn't let the meds work
at this time it's like feb. 1st to the 15th , and i'm still addicted
frustrated , writing shit for ye , tryna visualize someone else's vision
then he laid that verse on " u mad " and we made the shit the single
ye and hov getting into it over me , tryna do a joint venture
and g.o.o.d. music still fam , but it's that roc boy savemoney life
took the bus out on the road for the traffic tour , did a hundred nights
cleaned out my closet , i got rid of all of my demons
if you learn one thing from my journey , nigga it's don't stop believing
when this shit got so suffocating i could barely even keep breathing
wrote my wrongs all in this song now i'd like to welcome y'all to my season
nigga i'm gone
know i never die
we live forever in my mind
and i sanctify
we live forever , still alive
