what i’mma hit you with you motherfuckers better duck
i’m a bull in a china shop , watch how the uzi spit
who we with , bros with hammers and they like too legit
i ain’t got any time for your foolishness
raw raps from the same place where the kufi sits
he the mo’fucker always sippin’ goose and shit
stomp a rapper out , timberland boots and shit
the left hand is what i give you the contusions with
the right hand is where i write all of the ruthless shit
survival of the fit on my lil' boosie shit
my hands are made of stone cut from that medusa shit
big gold chains , we was on that dookie shit
still run with the kids i stole the gucci with
i punch you dead in the face so fuck the music shit
the guns commando , hollywood movie shit
y'all are weird , y'all on that lollapalooza shit
let the beard grow alhamdulelah , sofi shit
y’all are scared when i step inside the booth and shit
cuttin’ mo’fuckers cell roll on some sushi shit
y’all are cowards , y’all only talk on computer shit
this a haitian ritual , i’m on my voodoo shit
find out who’s the realest ( vinnie )
rock it not quick
what i’mma hit you with you motherfuckers better duck
death before dishonor , tiger blood y’all are fake
i let the .45 blocka blocka rob his cake
dead sea overlook the view from inside a grave
the dictionary definition of dominate
ya'll weed germantown brown lord , lots of shake
fat bull , but my pockets never out of shape
you a bitch , security guards lock the gates
the louis vuitton bootleg , prada fake
i’m tryin’ to make the same money that madonna make
eyes never lie , i’m surprised that you not with jake
rhymes in one take , record an album in an hour straight
you a pile of waste , i see a sucker and salivate
cutting motherfuckers off , time to consolidate
a thousand pounds of weight’ll force your heart to palpitate
it’s armageddon for you motherfuckers , lock the date
any bitch i meet means that i’mma copulate
my revolution will be met with peter tosh’s fate
that’s the reason that the god is tryin’ to populate
a connoisseur , i can tell you how the vodka taste
the .45 lift you , send you into outer space
