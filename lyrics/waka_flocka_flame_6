my partners sick up kids , they take what they gon tie in
in the bushes they lied in all night , that's my word
by the end of the month , they left with them birds
and i'm gone off that purp , and i'm slurring my words
i swerve in my benz , banged my forgi's on the curb

2 pints of lean'll have me slurring on my words

stomach full of money , so hundreds i'mma burp
all the hoods love us like the 15th and the 1st
2 pints of lean'll have me slurring on my words
undertaker car , triple black drop bird
stomach full of money , so hundreds i'mma burp
five grand for a head shot

triple red drop , bouncing through the parking lot

half a million dollars and the jury forget that bird
niggas screaming they want beef , i'm like " roger that ! "
my album didn't sell , so i'm laying niggas down
shooting every nigga that burps , sneezes or fucking frowns
40 carats on my bracelet , my polo black
niggas talking like they want beef i'm wanting that
7 grams in this swisher , i'm gon solo that
riding around with my strap like " where they at ? "
all these rap niggas hold us on my philly hat
you will never be a legend like the gucci man
you will never be turnt up like my partner flock
