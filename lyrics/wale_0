monogamy or whatever you call it
i'm startin' to think it ain't for er'ybody
most of us is rushin' into it anyways
you know what i'm sayin' ?
you ain't rushin' for love , and i ain't up here to judge
let's neglect the what if's
and make it do what it does , let's get it
is it bad that i never made love ?
no , i never did it
but i sure know how to fuck
i'll be your bad girl , i'll prove it to ya
i can't promise that i'll be good to ya
'cause i had some issues
i won't commit , no , not havin' it
but at least i can admit
that i'll be bad , no , to you ( to you )
yeah , i'll be good in bed
but i'll be bad to you
bad that i never made love
no , i never did it
but i sure know how to fuck
( let's get it ! )
bad girls ain't no good , and the good girls ain't no fun
and the hood girls want a smart nigga
college girls all want a thug
so it seems that we fiend what we don't need
got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
i ain't bout to judge you , don't judge me
you ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'cause i heard you ( bad , nooo )
in the literal sense i mean that
rough sex , sayin' i love ya
but to kiss them is sayin' you mean that ( bad , nooo )
i know , i just be callin' her mean - ass
oh the irony , got the bomb indeed
but the problem is probably a deep past
still i'm feelin' of somethin' i need bad
thinkin' if i get her , i get her to need this
i don't need emotions to open your deep sea
i conceive an ocean by goin' between legs
beg ? nope—bed , floor , dope ; go for it , couch now
slow motion around , put it down
lord knows she was gone ‘fore the morn' , hold up
is it bad that i never made love ?
no , i never did it
but i sure know how to fuck
i'll be your bad girl , i'll prove it to ya
i can't promise that i'll be good to ya
'cause i had some issues
i won't commit , no , not havin' it
but at least i can admit
that i'll be bad , no , to you ( to you )
yeah , i'll be good in bed
but i'll be bad to you
( yeah , let me tell you 'bout her , look ! )
she hurt feelings , she break hearts
she stay quiet , she play smart
she take pride in goin' out
and gettin' hollered at , and sayin' nah
she no saint , but she don't pose
she don't wear make up by the boatload
ridin' through lake shore with the nose up
she don't really date much , but it slows her up
she got haters , but we all do
heard you're winter - time cold , shawty , fall through
baby , look at they approach , how they court you
all those minds games
nevermind , 'cause they all lose ( bad , nooo )
in the physical sense i mean that
i ain't tryna kiss up , suck up , feed gas
i ain't like them nigga you suckin' your teeth at , nope
play big , trust me i'll humble yo' mean - ass
look , shawty is actually in prevent
'cause the one in front of her is workin' with deep threat
yep—bed , floor , couch , more
more , shower , lord , perm , done
love ? nah , called in the morn'
cell number wasn't on , goddamn !
is it bad that i never made love ?
no , i never did it
but i sure know how to fuck
i'll be your bad girl , i'll prove it to ya
i can't promise that i'll be good to ya
'cause i had some issues
i won't commit , no , not havin' it
but at least i can admit
that i'll be bad , no , to you ( to you )
yeah , i'll be good in bed
but i'll be bad to you
bad that i never made love
no , i never did it
but i sure know how to fuck
