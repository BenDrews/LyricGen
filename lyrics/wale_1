navigating through her eyes , destination to her thighs
and i hate to tell you too much , cuz i stay with too much pride
and we way too young to know love , maybe not but we don't need no rush
don't believe in love at first sight , but i believe in love at first huh
can i be with you just one night , i could wear you out inside
i could tell you like persistence , but i make you cum in tri's
i just think we need one night , can't decide if i came right
easy baby my thing tight , but that lotus flower just ain't right
i ain't thinking i ain't right , can't decide but i can't fight
easy baby. you the bomb and all , but i be damned if i do not land mine
or at least try , can i speak up ? was it peace out ? can we eat lunch ?
can we take shots ? what's your flavor ? flat drinks we call a cups
i just think i need one night , slightly more if it's done right
with that gorgeous face , i don't know your name , it ain't important babe cuz i'mma call you mine
we're living in a fantasy
i feel it when you dance with me
it's feeling like you need to be
my lady , my baby , yeah
can't you see
i'm talking about eternity
tell me would you care to be
my lady , my baby
cause i don’t know you , you don’t know me
the clock keeps ticking baby what's it gonna be
i don’t know you , you don’t know me
let me teach you all the sounds of love
ahhhh , ayyyyy , eeeeee , ahh ohh ooo
