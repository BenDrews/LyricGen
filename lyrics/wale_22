i apologize i don't recollect your name
but lemme tell you that them heels really complement your frame
girl lemme get them ooh aahs then i gotta catch my plane
say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time girl how could we get that way ?
look , another day another dollar
she hate me when i leave cuz when i leave i never call her
that's life shit alright , shit , i could call you right quick
but if i call you gone be like " boo why we haven't skyped yet ? "
and on skype bet you say " le where my flight at ? " , if i decline
then you inquire on where i spend my nights at
shit this life gets overwhelming and more then hectic
but a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
just look closer my life is quite deceptive
women'll sell they soul just to buy some attention
i need something to hold fuck that passive aggression
and when im back from off that road dont ask me no questions... please.. fear watchu dont know
don't remember how i met her but i know i won't forget her
and if loving her is wrong then i just know i won't see heaven
she say she from seattle , she twenty and some change
before i get to t.i.a. i'm sure to make her rain
then i'm back up on my plane chi - town o'hare
we spend some time and get some wine have some milds from harold's
i told her this here's overrated but i love your city baby
gotta get back to the d , you know we finally famous
driver drop me off at dulles im headed to some money
tsa be laughing all them rubbers in your luggage
i know ima always leave em but i swear ill always love em
tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another

air baggage claim awaiting miss thang outta st. louis

brings alotta joy buggati boy thats lane to lane
our faucets used to drip , i used to ride the bench
but it was written in cursive for this king to exist

gianni versaci connoisseur a carnivore
accountable for a half a million unaccounted for... boy
