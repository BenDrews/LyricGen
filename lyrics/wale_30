shawty no joking
and i'm hoping
'cuz i'm not slowing
gotta just keep on rolling..
i’m joking ( young boy moving fast )
and i’m hoping ( praying that i don’t crash )
( all i know is ) i’m not slowing
gotta just keep on rolling
gotta keep at it , gotta stay focused
moving fast
and i’m hoping , praying i don’t crash
all i know is i’m not slowing
gotta just keep on rolling
gotta keep at it , gotta stay focused
only live once , i'mma live mine up
fill up the cup , lemme light my blunt
i don't really know what the fuck's in my cup
but a couple shots of it got a nigga on stuck
i'm just here to have a good time
a little white chick , a little white wine..
out of town , spent a couple nights at taos
smoking weed in the suite 'til we out of towels
and don't bother me , high as shit from my broccoli
fly as shit for no goddamn reason
and y'all aiite - but y'all not like me
mmg and that's my clique
that's boa , see that's my set
cdg shit match my kicks
an apostrophe i'm behind that s
or the black beemer back to pick me up
back wood , the tree i’m ashing out
see i be kicking my raps good , with or without sales
i'm killing these blackheads , my rap is noxema
light it up for a nigga
one or two hoes ain't enough for a nigga
one or two bottles ain't enough for a nigga
red berry everywhere , got puff getting jealous
i’m joking ( young boy moving fast )
and i’m hoping ( praying that i don’t crash )
( all i know is ) i’m not slowing
gotta just keep on rolling
gotta keep at it , gotta stay focused
one night love : i'mma need that
he could own that , shawty , i'mma lease that
i'mma put you in the game where your cleats at
i'mma sign that work and release that
i don't be where the crabs or police at
i just be where the cash and the freaks at
smoking green bay nigga , i'm a cheesehead
in a lambo , see me where the g's at
$10k in my camos
word. 10 js and i can't move
shades : lv was a little dough
i'm going hard for the days i was piss poor
and go hard cause i feel it's only right to
maybach. g.o.o.d music : the right move
girls say everything that i write smooth
fuck rap , i'm getting pussy off a haiku
one time for the girls with the right shoes
fuckin with a dude probably the right move
two times for the chicks with the right bag
if it's right tonight , i might bite that
3 times , show me your peace sign
not with your hand girl
open your knees out !
look , money what we 'bout
stuntin when we out
double m - g - out !
