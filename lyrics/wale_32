in the grand scheme of things
we never were supposed to have shit
born to lose , built to win
folarin , let's get it in
we ain't supposed to never have nothing
we ain't supposed to never have shit
see the growth in my rhymes
see my focus ain't on them
nah , at the top is just us , right
let's get it
prps or some dunks you ain't on
givenchy , but no kilt , mi amor
we can't leave , for we love the allure
hold mine down and stay above what you on
on , i'm appeased and obliged
scorpio freaks quantity gemini
i'mma need me a light
ridin' through the cap , cap steez on the mind
i ain't know him but i wish i did
each one , teach one , may the youth live
on that , joey bad please hold your head
lost one last summer , livin' ain't fair
while them niggas scared , we forever here
hate to see you smile , money everywhere
dream killers out , i see them in the rear
before i put them in a song , put them in a prayer
amen
yeah , i'm focused , it's folarin here
i reckon your barbershop talk of this
heavenly father , may the spirit of god
help whoever at odds get your guidance quick
all we need keisha , all we need becky
all we need is god , and fed free fetti
my little buddy livestrong , young nigga peddle
he ain't make it in the leagues , so the streets wet him
gettin' wet up on the corner in whatever weather
before see the jail again , he gonna see the devil
been a week since he seen his mother
and 18 since he seen the other
i'mma pray for him
it's safe to say , he got some pain within
it ain't too much that i can say to him
cause my bank statement don't relate to him
i was so fresh , so clean when i stepped on that scene
pulled up aston martin , you could ask them ya'll seen
when i came through this bitch
paper tagging on lean
baddest bitch in the game
nigga that was ya'll dream
hold up , let me get a feel
like jackson , hold up
i don't feel these niggas , nah

when i was dead broke used to always tell myself i'mma still be the shit
told my p.o " she locked me up
