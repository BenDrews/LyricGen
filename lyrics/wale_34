ambitious girl , your drive , drives me crazy
i'm tryna stay with you , lay with you
i'll pay your tuition , and pray with you if you ain't in to wishin
i'm tryna fuck the shit out your aspirations
see , the last one i dated , i hated
we wake up , i go to work , she leave out
come back with some make up , high heels , and a purse , or
worse i ask , " babygirl , what you aspire to be ? "
she reply to me like , " why you perspiring me ? " bitch..
pardon me if i'm sweating you but
i wanna see something else in you before i invest in you
ambitious girl , ( what its hittin for ? )
i'd rather you tell me to hit you later
because you gotta finish a paper
then to be in my face asking for a rose cup
see these bitches can't cut in yo business
i'm in love with your business
and your productivity is the reason i interest , ambitious girl
see , i like the person that you are
but i'm in love with the person that you have potential to be
and all your dreams sharing with me
and your secrets baring with me
and the flaws , you ain't even got to mention to me
ambitious girl , you just wanna win , and you'd rather chase your dreams
then to try to chase these men
that try to chase these skirts
that try to chase these shots with flavors that ain't even as sweet as her
my ambitious girl , i won't forget you
i just reflect on how i ain't met you , yet boo
you somewhere , getting your life in order
so for this time being , i hope this open scribe might support her
support her , or work her , she worth it
i just want you to have something to listen to...
maybe in the morning
