fame has made me more foolish , uh
what would you do with all these lusty groupies ? uh
and i know that god has made me only human
but i'd like to take the time to describe to y'all my favorite woman
look , teeth , white and bright and still talk to me like we back home
and the weave ? that's optional
cause my only concern's that her head's strong
and her feet ? lemme see ; course you know i like them clean
and i can understand a little bruise

and ooh , i won't od , you'll get d , young as 19
i believe age is for math , all i need is chemistry , yeah

and i like a good story , i bet she got a mean tail

her emotions at peace , let's walk the shoreline ( huh ! )
statuesque as can be , we're spending more time
