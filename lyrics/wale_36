yeah , see , breaking up is hard
to move along , it's even harder
it's over , she got colder , now
can't locate where her heart is
and i'm just being honest
since we not even talking
my mind won't let you go
shit , even consider stalking now
you know i be teasing , though
you know that my ego won't
thought this was forever love
guess that was just seasonal
she got back with her old boy
she probably had a reason though
although thought that we would grow
guess that wasn't feasible
but we ain't gonna be beefing , no
i miss you at my recent show
i speak to cj often and sometimes
i just want to speak you up
yeah , hit you up
or call you up , or send a text
your new man got my respect
so if i do call it's just a check
heard that you alright though
my nigga for life though
it's funny how this life go
we love for a while then a light goes
took me a while just to write those
pride , i had a fight so
i'mma stop right there and i know you don't care
but i hope you got that bite , boo , ay
yeah , tell me about the love of ours
" contemplate " , i wrote about her
we no longer close or nothing
that's why she ignore my flowers
and my call and my text
spending her time with him i guess
i regret some shit i did
but darling , is y'all intimate ?
who was better ? i know i was
don't you lie , don't blow my buzz
you ask me who i'm stroking now
i say that the pool is closed
can we stay broken up ?
and all these pages , close them up
i hope we both do learn from this
so my next joint don't got to be so rough
huh , got to get better with time
relationships should never rewind
better leave it all behind
guess that means you can never be mine
well , um , there's a but
without your love it's cold as fuck
life is a movie we both say " cut "
but most times darling the sequel sucks
