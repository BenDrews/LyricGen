jerry : oh so there's still hope ?
george : i don't want hope , hope is killing me. my dream is to become hopeless. when you're hopeless you don't care , and when you don't care , that indifference , it makes you attractive
a nigga feelin' hopeless
who am i to change perception ?
if a nigga kill a nigga he's another statistic
if his skin's a little different they gon' say it was self defense
nigga feelin' hopeless
starin' at the idiot box , riddle me this
if a killer was a nigga would niggas still really care
cause niggas worser than zimmerman livin' life everywhere
niggas hopeless
small niggas with big tools
couldn't get to harvard , hard work , he hard whipped
cause them hardy har's and hard nights are hard to live through
when you hopeless
what we gotta do to be winnin' ?
cause all the schools gettin' closed
dribble a little , coach , shootin' at a foe
cause they chargin' them to hoop at community center
my nigga , hopeless
25 bands , he was shootin' not a damn givin'
cousin threw a couple grand at some dancers
throwin' back their fat ass , is my glasses confused ?
we're the hopeless
america's dream and nightmare in the same being
even when being polite here
niggas try to bring me down , the life of a pioneer
lightyears worth of hopeless
celebrity celebrated disgusts me
the cerebellum invaded with all these fresh things on
watchin' " love and hip hop : atlanta " as we speak
nigga we hopeless
okay , the steebie show is on
and so my broad rollin' weed now she's mad at me
cause she seen a scene with rasheeda baby father
said , " you niggas all hopeless "
got a pocket full of lint again , but it make no difference to me
fallin' out with my friends again , but it make no difference to me
goddamn i'm hopeless , hopeless , hopeless , hopeless
oh man , i'm hopeless , hopeless , hopeless , hopeless
got no gas in my tank again , but it make no difference to me
overdraft at the bank again , but it make no difference to me
goddamn i'm hopeless , hopeless , hopeless , hopeless
lord knows i'm hopeless , hopeless , hopeless , hopeless , still i pray
nigga feelin' hopeless
like a penny with a hole in it
we as empty as a coraz√≥n of a widow
from a soul that she don't know when he's comin' home
he don't got no limit , hopeless
what's a purple heart to a hurt head ?
he done done 12 years , he was told 6
prolly go back in a minute , ain't shit here
nigga so hopeless
thoughts are ravaging in the whole crib
now he post - traumatic and always on the edge
on the pills , some bills , two kids , one leg
nigga so hopeless
a lot of black cops always clap back
and some foul white cops always on deck
playin' race card , guarantee you'll make a blackjack
nigga so hopeless
cause we ain't 'posed to ever have shit
and we ain't vocalise rap
niggas cause we don't promote unless we drop hits
nigga hopeless
look at what i go through to show you
niggas respect money , money respect power
and power , we never given unless a nigga catch , shoot or dribble
we are hopeless
nah you ain't out here for the culture
you finna riot , without a purpose
you ain't a mothafuckin' rider , you a fuckin' token , posin'
nigga hopeless , of course not literal
but why complain about the man when a nigga want my skin
the same problems with them i had is out there killin' niggas too
eat your food , nigga
got a pocket full of lint again , but it make no difference to me
fallin' out with my friends again , but it make no difference to me
goddamn i'm hopeless , hopeless , hopeless , hopeless
oh man , i'm hopeless , hopeless , hopeless , hopeless
got no gas in my tank again , but it make no difference to me
overdraft at the bank again , but it make no difference to me
goddamn i'm hopeless , hopeless , hopeless , hopeless
lord knows i'm hopeless , hopeless , hopeless , hopeless , still i pray
