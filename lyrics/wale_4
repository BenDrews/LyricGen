the time is now , on everything
took my heart away from money
i ain't interested in fame
and i pray that never change
ambition is priceless
it’s something that’s in your veins
and i put that on my name
uh , only hope i had was selling dope
was on my grind cause times was harder than a cellar floor
my momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
i grew up looking up to niggas that was selling coke
oh , i was raised by the stop sign
no religion i was getting saved by the glock nine
by the minute i was getting paid like a hot line
servin' raw and , fiends was calling , we was dot com
well connected , well respected and well protected
ain't get accepted , was rejected and now they regret it
ain't get my message , was no signal when i was texting
the niggas i was calling was fraud and i learned my lesson
now i move with aggression , use my mind as a weapon
cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
so throw that pass , i’ll be the cornerback
me and folarin mmg gon' bring that warner back
for my ambition
easy to dream a dream , though it's harder to live it
they gon' love me for my ambition
easy to dream a dream , though it's harder to live it
they gon' love me for my ambition
easy to dream a dream , though it's harder to live it
look , they gon' love me for my ambition
beautiful music , painting pictures that be my vision
it speaks for itself
define ambition for me
my ambition to win , just to get me some ends
help me pay my little rent , maybe sit in a benz
i saw momma praying as she wait on results
it was hot in the kitchen can i wait on the porch
my father was missing , war lord oliver north
life was diggin’ me deeper , i kept on coming up short
breaking so many laws , waking up in the dark
who cut my power off ? it’s time to move that powder soft
not too many options when you coming from the projects
sittin’ in the trap now you moving cyndi lauper
girls wanna have fun , and a nigga with some change
and i doubt that ever change
ambition is priceless that’s something that's in your veins
and i doubt that ever change
ambition is my shit and i put that on my name
and i doubt that ever change
for my ambition
easy to dream a dream , though it's harder to live it
they gon' love me for my ambition
easy to dream a dream , though it's harder to live it
they gon' love me for my ambition
easy to dream a dream , though it's harder to live it
look , they gon' love me for my ambition
beautiful music , painting pictures that be my vision
well wishes to my opposition
you niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol
i got nothing against them , they got fucking potential
but every nigga who can read gotta get his issue
subscribe , niggas reside where all the lions and killers be
and i ain't spend a minute up in the streets
but i’m limitless mentally , i’m lyrically zmt
lebron shit , i was in that 6 after 23
and family is everything , and money is less important
long as your mama love you , don’t ever love a woman
i got a lot of bitches , they got a lot of feelings
but i got that green on my eyes
and that ain’t no donnie simpson
i retire you niggas : fuck you and your position !
they placeholding so slippery niggas can’t even kick it
y’all rambling , talking shit to these bitches
you know you real you don’t say it
you know you real , we gon feel it
ralph !
beautiful music , painting pictures that be my vision
they gon love me for my ambition
easy to dream a dream , but much harder to live it
look , they gon love me for my ambition
beautiful music , painting pictures that be my vision
they gon love me for my ambition
