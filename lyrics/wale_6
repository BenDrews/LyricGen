shawty , can i fill your tank , yeah ?
i start off with that , " what you drinkin' ? "
pardon if i'm road raging
but i know you heard my drive is crazy
yeah , let me pace that with some patience
let me do it till i fill every void
you're like a maybach , thinking damn
they ain't even make 'em like you no more
it's like a high beam gleaming through your eye ( bling )
i adore you up , baby suicide
a little wordplay , i'm hoping i can make you smile
least until i'm out of line like a dui
girl , you remind me of my jeep
can i see what's up with that g - wagon ?
can i take you off of these streets ?
to the side of me , i'm trying to see your hazards
trying to be with the baddest , won't be the fastest
gotta make it last , i hope you comfortable
i need to get to you , you're like a '62
a little work then it's curtains when i'm skrrting through
came through in the group , trying to leave in the coupe
that mean i gots a few , but i believe in you
trying to chase the cat , know i'm killing it , dawg
you ain't feeling me naw , that mean i don't need the roof
you remind me of my jeep , i wanna ride it
you something like my car
i got the keys to them , i need the keys to you
you put on a show , you don't need no clothes
give me little bit more , always take it slow
i know you don't wanna stop , i'm trying to make it go
now speed it up like a maserati , and look at me and pose
baby , you got a body like a benz
and i'm just trying to drive it once again
baby , you got a body like a benz
and i'm just trying to drive it once again
a good woman is scarce to us
and i wasn't prepared to love
i know it sound crazy , but your miles scare me
i'm just here cause your character good ( truth be told )
a good nigga is rare to her ( truth be told )
you heard it all , but hear this love
one night with dude , i be the reason you cool
so let me know am i clear enough , yeah , what's up ?
way i , way i , that's the way i think
shawty straight like a concept on bayonne street
in the morning i slide over , she needs a ride i'm like
" tight , let's keep it amg "
sliding down , precipitating is straight
top down , let me kiss your physique
i'm digging your fleek , i'm checkin' your gear
can tell you had a good year , spent a grip on your feet
she like when i drive it , i like it in park
pull that thing over you likely to sore
i got her floating like riding on stars
so i keep it gps , see where this going
nothing will stop it , i slide in no prob
ch - ch - chop it , my swipe your parts
sex is her weapon , my snake in her garden
so know when i'm not here the viper is on
you put on a show , you don't need no clothes
give me little bit more , always take it slow
i know you don't wanna stop , i'm trying to make it go
now speed it up like a maserati , and look at me and pose
baby , you got a body like a benz
and i'm just trying to drive it once again
