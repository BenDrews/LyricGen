i guess maybe some little problems could arise
( there are always a few )
if anything happened and we couldn't be friends the way we are now , that would really be bad
( devastating )
because this is very good
( and that would be good )
that would be good too , the idea is to combine this and that
tryna keep it low
keep 'em on that need to know
tell everybody that we're just friends
but to be honest that platonic shit's for tv shows
same place , we're with different folks
case closed if they crack the code
is it me , or is you cold ?
cause the feelings you ain't showin' pokin' out your clothes
go put a sweater on or get a room
forbidden fruit , swimmin' in your juice
lot of ways i can get to you
but my train of thought is tryna get you out your ch - ch - choo
still we keep it low
keep 'em all on that need to know
could somebody tell somebody
i'm somebody and i'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go
work
i'm not tryna pressure you
just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
you ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend
i just wanna know your name
and maybe some time , we can hook up
we can hang out , we can just chill
tryna keep it low
keep 'em all on that need to know
tell 'em all that we're just cool
as far as me and you , we got a simple code
spendin' nights , well that's optional
no telephones in the afternoon
i know that overthinkin' only leads to subtweetin'
every time your ass in the mood
sharin' thoughts when we share a room
though we barely talk when we share a room
in the dark , still see your curves
body like what , swear to god you're a miracle
still we keep it low
keep 'em all on that need to know
could somebody tell somebody
i'm somebody and i'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go
i'm not tryna pressure you
just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
you ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend
i just wanna know your name
and maybe some time , we can hook up
we can hang out , we can just chill
i mean let's say , what if we did ?
( what if ? )
is that like the end of the world or something ?
( certainly not ! )
why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to ?
( i know ! )
i mean really , what is the big deal ? we go in there , we're in there for a while and then we come back out here. it's not complicated
( it's almost stupid if we didn't ! )
it's moronic
( absurd ! )
i'm not tryna pressure you
just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
you ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend
i just wanna know your name
and maybe some time , we can hook up
we can hang out , we can just chill
