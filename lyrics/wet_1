...it's just not right , it's
i don't wanna be your girl no more , no more
i just wanna see your face at home , home , home
you can't do me right
so i... decide that
i don't wanna be your girl no more , no more
i just wanna see you up and out , out of the door , no
i'm not living right
so i... decide that
i don't wanna be your girl no more , no more
i won't hide the ways , i've tried
it's just not right
it's killing me tonight
so , so
