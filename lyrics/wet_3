all i know is
when you hold me
i still feel lonely
lonely when you hold me
all i know is
i can't focus
on these arms around me
think of how you found me
found me in those arms
so large and dark and holding on
all i know is
when you hold me
are you thinking rosalie
or is she in me ?
and all the rest
well , baby , you're the best
we'll figure out the rest
and maybe it's a test
i think we'd better quit while we're ahead
all i know is
when we're sleeping
our friends , they creep in
and all the rest
all i know is
you hardly know me
but you still owe me
and all the rest
well , baby , you're the best
we'll figure out the rest
and maybe it's a test
i think we'd better quit while we're ahead
