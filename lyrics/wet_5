tell me , baby , tell me slowly
all the things you couldn't show me
tell me one more time before i leave
now i see you never knew me
look at you , you look right through me
tell me one more time before i go
i don't believe you when you
say you love me most
and when you tell me i'm the only one
and i can't feel you when you're
touchin' me and tellin' me
that this time you want all of me
and you won't hear me when i'm
tellin' you it's all or nothin'
all or nothin' , baby please
let go of me , let go of me
when you say you love me , baby
let me see your face
and when you say you'll never leave me
know it's all in vain
and these memories , they haunt me
wherever i go
tell me , baby , say it slowly
all the things you never showed me
tell me one more time before i leave
now i see you hardly know me
i learned your way , i learned so slowly
take another shot , but you'll miss me
i don't believe you when you
tell me that you love me most
and when you tell me i'm the only one
and i can't feel you when you're
kissin' me and tellin' me
that all my fears are in my head
and you won't hear me when i
tell you that it's all or nothin'
all or nothin' , baby please
let go of me
when you say you love me , baby
let me see your face
and when you say you'll never leave me
know that it's all in vain
and these memories , they haunt me
wherever i go
