if i had to pick
my money , my bitch
bye bye , bitch
i gotta get rich
in it
if it come down to it , i don't love that ho
if i gotta pick , i'ma pick my dough
drop it in the pot
whip it up and get mo'
you know i gotta do it
got a couple checks and i ran right through it
got a couple hoes and i ran right through it
the only thing that hurt was the money when i blew it
if it come down to it , you know what i pick
mob , money over my bitch
grind hard cause i gotta get rich
and , i'ma keep ballin' cause i love this shit
and , i'ma keep thuggin , cause i love this shit
money gon' always pull me a bitch
press a button in the benz and the seats do tricks
we be gettin' to the money
on the road hittin' licks
keep it one hundred
i'm never gonna switch
money train , no politics
and if i ain't got money , i ain't got funds
if i ain't got funds , then i can't buy guns
if i can't buy guns , then these niggas try to jack
if it come down to it , would you have my back ?
no , i ain't think so
i'ma leave it just like that
i'ma chase the money
i don't chase these hoes
i stack , they slack. i'ma stack the dough
you don't work , don't eat
my nigga , all the time
you better stack you paper , be 'bout yourself
fuckin' with these hoes'll have you by yourself
i'm laid back , but still paid up
i just grind and recline , no change ups
i said , i'm laid back , but still paid up
i just grind and recline , no change ups
i'm in the cut , still stackin' bucks
don't worry 'bout me , just know i came up
y'all know my name , y'all know what i claim
make way , all aboard for the money train
make way , all aboard for the money train
make way , all aboard for the money train
