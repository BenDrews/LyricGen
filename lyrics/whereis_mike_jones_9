tie an army to your bootstraps , coffee in your cup
walking with an ancient boombap , screaming
what the fuck
in 2009 critics line is net form and kids want fans before they even sweat for em
forced into a basement that's baking in the sun
with million other vagrants , they pay us just to run
see , planet earth's a treadmill , i'm tryna get my gun
before they drop flights and stop air travel to my lungs
dial an operator , got a problem with the matrix
tired of being overlooked because we never say shit
some might even go as far to say i lack passion
that's probably because i stowed it on a friendship that's crashing
asking for a little respect and ration
while we get the lashing for seeking compassion
i once begged to use compuserve as a teen
yesterday i saw a murder on my computer screen
you see , fads and phases have swept the ages
turning real places into a digital day trip
the basic nature is a devilish component
that forces us to capture the moment , and own it
but have you ever reached out on your own
for a dream that you could hold ?
looked 'round at what was going down
seemed just out of control
and if you ever looked down deep inside but couldn't even find a soul
then you know that this truman show is like stumbling down a winding road
got friends having kids in a world that don't support them
picking up the paper , point of view is post - mortem
each breath's a gift , wrapped in all kinds of boredom
so i contort them , then deport them in the morning
exhale , flying through a tunnel with a set sail
playing miami heat and hope to god that i don't get hail
feeling the blues because my hip hop mood is just not true
i'm lost , which door do i choose ?
one side is underground hip hop fans
too stubborn to raise his hands or support sound scams
the other side is nickelodeon
teenie - bopping jonases
where you make popcorn with some big fucking bonuses
but it's too late , i left my theater camp
and plus i cheer for a chance to leave your ear in a slant
putting me inside a strange lame - brain purgatory
where i can't go back to basement , so move the further stories
unbe - fucking - lievable , flesh wound is bleeding through test tubes
and needles to get through ; what's eating you ?
my view is retro , motown switched around
type of shit to make you say , " bitch , get down , " like you're chris brown
i'd love some pot money but the rules are domestic
making independent moves that fill your groove with asbestos
so here we are , locked late and top shape
breaking my cuffs , still stuck between a rock and a hard place
