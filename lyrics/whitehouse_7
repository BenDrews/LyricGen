donovan slack , politico : i just want to return to beyonce and jay - z. jay - z released a rap today , i know the other day you said that treasury was the one that cleared their trip , he suggested that he got white house permission – that he personally spoke with the president. i’ll just quote : “i turned havana into atlanta. boy from the hood , i got white house clearance. obama said chill you gonna get me impeached. you don’t need this expletive anyway , chill with me on the beach. "
jay carney : i guess nothing rhymes with treasury , because treasury offers and gives licenses for travel , as you know , and the white house has nothing to do with it.
slack : so are you saying that he did not , the president , did not have a conversation with jay - z ?
jay carney : i am absolutely saying that the white house , from the president on down , had nothing to do with anybody's personal - - anybody's travel to cuba. that is something that treasury handles.
