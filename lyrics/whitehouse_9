can i suggest you :
get fucked
while you lie about child - molesting gropes
and parkbench flashers and pervert creeps
and anal virginity and polaroid snaps
and verbal abuse and bathroom rapes
i don't know how well you can :
remember your own pointless glue - sniffing adolescence
that fumbling floppy sex
in between fags
those pathetic fistfights
all those pathetic petty thefts
and this and that and this and that and this and that
and every other fucking adidas - clich√©d cringe
can i suggest you :
pose
while you take another frantic glance at your shopwindow reflection
ensuring the stinking lie is maintained
because that's the difference between you
yes , that's the difference between you
you'll let a leering scumbag beerdrinking rat
raise your nostrils for a close - up smell
of fingertip nicotine and animal fat
and force an open dead mouth
lap up ounces of semichem sweat
so can you feel that :
would be a truly truly disgusting thing ?
and that's the difference between me
i'll open the package
i'll watch the show
i'll enjoy perfectly well - made art
i'll get in line behind stupidity
i'll let you lie through your teeth
i'll make you feel special
i'll not pick out the mistakes in public
i'll just put it down to passion
and feigned memory lapse
what did you want to be when you grow up ?
certainly not raped
that's the difference between you
a drunk ? a drug addict
a motherly protector of the young ?
another bed - staining cunt ?
a child molestor that needs to be told ?
or just a craven lust - driven artist
channelling confusion and fear
into a sickly limp repetitive craft
yes , that's the difference between you
you'll act late and surprised
you say you loved sex ?
you'll love being hated for the act
the filthier the abuse and the desperate underage details
the fatter the payback
so rather than just listen
be altered by what's been said
now that's the difference between me
i'll show you emotional truth
i'll show you the fucking source
i'll show you yet another fucking liar
and this is for the you
i'll show you that something that makes you :
feel different
feel special
i'll give you :
thoughts
images
sounds
i'll give the you something
even more interesting than the last one
and i'll tell you why it's the best one yet
and then you can look back on it all
and say :
this is the best thing that ever happened to me
and see :
why you never became a dancer
