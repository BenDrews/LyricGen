i'm in the deep end , cannonball jump
thinking of your love and my heart beats like a drum
not feeling guilty , cause the water's just right
oh , it might be wrong , might be the time of your life
so jump on in with me
let me set you free
i'll make you feel like you're dreaming
try try try , to follow the rules
i break every one of them with boys like you
my oh my , doing what i always do
yeah i'm crossing every line to get to boys like you
boys like you , you , tripping , freaking falling over boys like you
it's getting hot out under that summer sun
i'm not playing games , i'm just a girl having fun
i need to cool down , cause i know we're just friends
but one look from you baby then i'm falling back in
what's a girl to do ?
i got it mad for you
you make me feel like i'm dreaming
try try try , to follow the rules
i break every one of them with boys like you
my oh my , doing what i always do
yeah i'm crossing every line to get to boys like you
boys like you , you , tripping , freaking falling over boys like you
i get a feeling , looking you in the eye
know you wanna take a bite of my cherry pie
get so excited , boy youâ€™re making me blush
let's just take our time now , there ain't no need to rush , no
why don't you make a move ?
you got nothing else to lose
just make me feel like i'm dreaming
try try try , to follow the rules
i break every one of them with boys like you
my oh my , doing what i always do
yeah i'm crossing every line to get to boys like you
boys like you , you , tripping , freaking falling over boys like you
i got that something i know you can't resist
i'm gonna make you feel it when i blow you that kiss
