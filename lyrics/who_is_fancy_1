i was a hot mess , in my sunday best
black tears in my eyes
you were my first love , you were my only one
i can't believe your lies
once we were like bottle rockets
now i know i have to stop it
please believe me , this isn't easy
i just need to say goodbye
goodbye , goodbye
losing my mind
goodbye
you got a new friend , you like to play pretend
i'm just keeping my cool
turn on that smoke machine , magic and make believe
she'll never know you like i do
once we were like fire burning
now you're just a lesson i'm learning
please believe me , this isn't easy
i just need to say goodbye
goodbye , goodbye
losing my mind
goodbye
i know that i can find somebody
you won't ever find nobody else like me
once we were like bottle rockets
now i know i have to stop it
please believe me , this isn't easy
i just need to say goodbye
goodbye , goodbye
losing my mind
goodbye
