i wish could tie you up in my shoes
make you feel unpretty too
i was told i was beautiful
but what does that mean to you ?
look into the mirror , who's inside there ?
you see the one with the red hair
same old me again today ( yeah )
my outsides look cool
my insides are blue
every time i think i'm through
it's because of you
i've tried different ways
but it's all the same
cause t the end of the day
i have myself to blame
and now i'm just trippin'
you can buy your hair if it won't grow
you can fix your nose if he says so
you can buy all the makeup that m.a.c. can make
but if you can't look inside you
and find out who am i too
be in the position to make me feel so
damn unpretty
ohh , ohh , ohh
was never insecure until i met you
but now i'm bein' stupid
i used to be so cute to me
now i just wanna be skinny
why am i doing all these things
just to keep you happy
maybe i get rid of you and then i'll get back to me
