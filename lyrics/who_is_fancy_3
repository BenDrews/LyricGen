whatever happened to romance ?
cause i'm a sucker for a slow dance
whatever happened to just taking time ?
i'm always looking for a wild night
but always falling for the wrong guy
yes i'm praying for the change of tide
won't anybody call me family
and say to me , yeah
baby this is our time
we can take it fast or slow
we can do whatever we want
so long as it feels good and the moment is right
so come and let your guards down
you can't let them in my house
we can do whatever we want
so long as it feels good and the moment is right
ah - ooh , ah - ooh , ah - ooh , ah - ooh
we're all surrounded by the quick love
but i'm done sleeping in the bad lights
oh , i'd rather wish above the hours
you bring me wine and bring me flowers
will my heart before you split in half
won't anybody call me family
and say to me , yeah
baby this is our time
we can take it fast or slow
we can do whatever we want
so long as it feels good and the moment is right
so come and let your guards down
you can't let them in my house
we can do whatever we want
so long as it feels good and the moment is right
ah - ooh , ah - ooh , ah - ooh , ah - ooh
when i find you , when i find you
