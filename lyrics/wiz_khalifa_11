it's young khalifa , man
2 chainz !
money's the motivation , money's the conversation
you on vacation , we gettin paid so
we on paycation , i did it for the fam
it's whatever we had to do , it's just who i am
yeah , it's the life i chose
gunshots in the dark , one eye closed
and we got it cooking like a one - eyed stove
you can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed
perfecting my passion , thanks for asking
couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
you used plastic , we 'bout cash
i see some people ahead that we gon' pass
i never feared death or dying
i only fear never trying
i am whatever i am
only god can judge me , now i'm
one shot , everything rides on tonight
even if i've got three strikes
i'mma go for it
this moment , we own it
and i'm not to be played with
because it can get dangerous
see these people i ride with
this moment , we own it
and the same ones that i ride with
be the same ones that i die with
put it all out on the line with
if you looking for me you can find wiz
in the new car or in the crown with
my new broad , thats a fine chick
and the wonder squad , i'm down with
ain't no way around it
what you say , tell me what you say
working hard , reppin for my dogs , do this every day
takin' off , looking out for all , makin sure we ball
like the mob all you do is call
catch you if you fall , young khalifa
i never feared death or dying
i only fear never trying
i am whatever i am
only god can judge me , now i'm
one shot , everything rides on tonight
even if i've got three strikes
i'mma go for it
this moment , we own it
and i'm not to be played with
because it can get dangerous
see these people i ride with
this moment , we own it
( i ride or die for love )
this the biggest day of my life
we got big guns , been graduated from knives
it's the day in the life and i'm ready to ride
got the spirit , i'm feelin like a killer inside
financial outbreak , i'm free but i ain't out yet
ridin with the plug so i'm close to the outlet
at the red light , rims sittin off set
i look better on your girl than her outfit
stuck to the plan , always think that we would stand up , never ran
we the fam and loyalty never change up
been down since day one , look at where we came from
jumpin out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it
got a problem , i got the same one
money rolls , we fold
plently clubs we closed
follow the same code
never turn our backs , our cars dont even lose control
one shot , everything rides on tonight
even if i've got three strikes
i'mma go for it
this moment , we own it
and i'm not to be played with
because it can get dangerous
see these people i ride with
this moment , we own it
i ride or die for mine
iâ€™m ride or die material
only one life to live , so here we go
( this moment , we own it )
