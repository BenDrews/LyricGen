i done kept it real from the jump
livin' at my mama’s house , we'd argue every month
nigga , i was tryin' to get it on my own
workin' all night , traffic on the way home
and my uncle calling me like " where ya at ?
i gave you the keys told ya bring it right back”
nigga , i just think it's funny how it goes
now i’m on the road , half a million for a show
and we...
boys tell stories about ya man
say i never struggled , wasn't hungry , yeah , i doubt it
nigga , i could turn your boy into the man
there ain't really much i hear that's poppin' off without us
nigga , we just want the credit where it's due
i’mma worry about me , give a fuck about you

you smell it as soon as i blaze
burnin' a pound , burnin' a pound , burnin' a pound
yeah , it’s goin' down , it’s goin' down , it’s goin' down

all black trucks when we pull up to the lear
all black coupe , i look like bruce when i’m steerin'
hope the homie drake don’t get pissed
but niggas never ever put your man on songs like this
and i probably said no to it before
but i made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour
and i just seen waka the other day
