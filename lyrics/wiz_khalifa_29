damn , we back in business
uh , wakin' up the neighbors , you could hear the headboard shakin'
i leave all your body parts achin'
speedin' up the pace while i look right into your face
you tell me that's that good shit you're tastin'
and i know you like it from the side
but tonight i'mma just unwind and let you ride and watch you take it
cause i'm tryin' to get you so wet , i mean so wet
if there's a record for this shit then i'mma break it
it's goin' down no matter the place or time my car
i got enough space
think anything you think you want , no prob i got enough cake
all up in it in the mornin' , knowin' damn well that i had you up late
ain't buyin' it you ain't spendin' it , you keep throwin' it back so i'm givin' it
you love when i get up in it
you love when i get , you love when i get ( x4 )
wake up when i bake up that's just somethin' that i do
pick your favorite sex scene , that's what i'm gon' do to you
up in my bed's where you probably belong
givin' you all that i got 'til it's gone
sexy as fuck you still got them heels on
favorite position , we tryin' them all
once i get in can't get out of my zone
fuck you so good you won't pick up your phone
and when your girlfriends or whoever do call
you fuckin' with me so you tell 'em you gone
you don't smoke so i break it down , you roll it up
you poke it out , your face down so i hold it up
you don't give a shit that my money so big i can't fold it up
plus i ain't tired 'til you finish , this ain't a race but i'm winnin'
you don't even gotta name a place where we can go
cause we already goin' , goin' , goin'
don't nobody gotta ask or even got to know
baby we already goin' , goin' , goin'
