i built this family on loyalty
count another grip , smoke another zip
let them young niggas tell it i be on my shit
make a hundred k , spend it all today
what can i say , my dna is givenchy
what my swag is ? retarded , what i'm driving ? ferrari
what i'm rocking , armani , gianni , versace , huh
fuck around and i'll buy one of you broke niggas
my change , insane , my chain , oh that thing ?
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
stackin' cheese till my bread right
smokin' weed till my head right
did it all on my own so , i'mma spend all my bread like
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
oh , stackin' cheese till my bread right
smokin' trees till my head right
did it all on my own so , i'mma spend all my bread like
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
my hair longer than your girl , go shawty , it's your world
sub - zero flow , when i spit , i see snow flurries
scarface , all out , all i want in this world
i mean all i want for lunch , is a blunt , and your girl
it ain't nothin' to me but it's somethin' to you
count money like it's somethin' to do
summer time , i'm like fuck the roof
winter time , i'm in 'lo boots
and uh , it's nothin' , i like being high because it's a better view
and , i told your ho my chain so cold it's on theraflu
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
stackin' cheese till my bread right
smokin' weed till my head right
did it all on my own so , i'mma spend all my bread like
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
oh , stackin' cheese till my bread right
smokin' trees till my head right
did it all on my own so , i'mma spend all my bread like
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing

party in south of france when it's cold
used to rock all that old shit till it got old
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
stackin' cheese till my bread right
smokin' weed till my head right
did it all on my own so , i'mma spend all my bread like
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing , it's nothing
