when this song come on , i'm spending money
play something i can spend some money to
when this song come on , i'm spending money

highly faded , but i'm highly paid so i just live my life
that shit you niggas tryna do , i guarantee i did it twice
they say life's a gamble , hit my joint and roll the dice
when you living this high , you can't be afraid of heights
book my flight to vegas , will , 20 thou - to stay the night
another 10 on champagne , my money long , i pay the price
tired of niggas saying they in my gang cause dog , we ain't alike
i'm throwing money , when i walk up in this bitch , they know it's money
money in my arms , other table full of money
pocket full of joints i rolled , dropping ashes on my clothes
balling super hard , smoking 'til i overdose
hardly ever sober , bitch we party 'til it's over
when this song come on , i'm spending money
play something i can spend some money to
when this song come on , i'm spending money
play something i can spend some money to
niggas always hating on me , talking 'bout i'm balling too
get your money up and quit your hating's what you oughta do
i been going hard since i was young when i was in my teens
i knew when i got older i'd be on , so now i do my thing
spending money , popping hella bottles , making niggas mad
going places , rolling js , i live the life you wish you had
throwing out dollars bills , putting shit on my tab
got a joint full of that og , got a clique full of them ogs
trippy nigga hit the club , you know i be fucked up
chasing after model chicks , tryna get my fucks up
niggas handcuffing hoes , but them niggas know what's up
y'all came to the club together , but that ho gon' leave with us
break out the blue dream , e'rybody rolling up
where the lean ? where the cups ? ho , it's time to po' it up
tell the owner we ain't leavin' , we gon' buy the whole club
( now my dollars to the ceiling , and my card ain't got no limit )
when this song come on , i'm spending money
play something i can spend some money to
when this song come on , i'm spending money
play something i can spend some money to
