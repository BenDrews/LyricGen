searching for the thrill of it , thrill of it
say that it's love , but to me it's looking counterfeit
i get done with one , and move right on to another bitch
yeah , college educated , she graduated
any bill she can't front , her parents paid it
the show was far , you the only one with a car
and your girlfriends , but being that she's a big fan , of course she made it
most girls wanna hide the fact that the thrill , they chase it
but you , just wanna get drunk tonight and fuck someone famous
so i just name a time and a place and your game for it
value player , hotel room , meet you there
walking on a dream
how can i explain
talking to myself
will i see again
we are always running for the thrill of it , thrill of it
always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
on and on and on we are calling out and out again
never looking down , i'm just in awe of what's in front of me
and i'm addicted to champagne
fuck the room , we buy the whole wing
bitches i taylor gang that
they just wanna know where the planes at
wake up drunk , go to sleep fucked up
we both amazed at what we just done
mixing drinks , knowing we'll regret this
ain't been asleep yet , room service bringing us breakfast
all this money , darling , what else is left to do
but smoke and enjoy my presidential view
got a swimming pool in my living room
on stage , interviews , tons of sour , let's consume
don’t stop ! …
just keep going on
i’m your ! …
shoulder to lean upon
so come on ! …
and deliver from inside
all we got is tonight
that is right , till first light !
