i looked in the mirror today
and seen the realest nigga i ever met in my life
hahahaha , uhh
i done smoked weed where they said i can't
got rich when they said i can't
got high and got on the plane
and brought all my niggas when they said i can't
went shopping places they said i can't
bought some shit that they said i can't
jumped on the road and did all them shows
cause i was poppin' places they said i ain't
went hard in places they said i can't
promoters call and try and set up dates
bought the car with that yellow paint
go to parties now and they set up drinks
and it's first class so i'm private plane
nudie jeans with my get up mane !
rolling papers and mary j
i made eleven mill and i'm still the same
what's with all these niggas and their feelings , man ?
all of this and i'm still the man
thought of this when i was just a fan
but all this money wasn't in the plan
now it's all about them benjamins

started underneath the floor
now my money through the ceiling
always staying on my grind , turned nothing to a million
used to just tryna live , now a nigga make a killin'
gold rollie on my arm , ten rings like a don
cuban links in my chain , zigzag on my charm
champagne on ice , good weed in the jar
everything hermes , chanel seats in the car
when you all know them fuck niggas start hatin'
talkin' bout what they gon' do but i'm waitin'
when you getting rich they doubt you
