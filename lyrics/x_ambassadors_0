hold , hold on , hold on to me
'cause i'm a little unsteady , a little unsteady
hold , hold on , hold on to me
'cause i'm a little unsteady , a little unsteady
mama , come here
approach , appear
daddy , i'm alone
'cause this house don't feel like home
if you love me , don't let go , woah
if you love me , don't let go
hold , hold on , hold on to me
'cause i'm a little unsteady , a little unsteady
hold , hold on , hold on to me
'cause i'm a little unsteady , a little unsteady
mother , i know
that you're tired of being alone
dad , i know you're trying
to fight when you feel like flying
but if you love me , don't let go , woah
if you love me , don't let go
hold , hold on , hold on to me
'cause i'm a little unsteady , a little unsteady
hold , hold on , hold on to me
'cause i'm a little unsteady , a little unsteady
hold , hold on , hold on to me
'cause i'm a little unsteady , a little unsteady
