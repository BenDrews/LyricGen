run away - ay with me
lost souls in revelry
running wild and running free
two kids , you and me
and i say
hey , hey hey hey
living like we're renegades
hey hey hey
hey hey hey
living like we're renegades
renegades , renegades
long live the pioneers
rebels and mutineers
go forth and have no fear
come close and lend an ear
and i say
hey , hey hey hey
living like we're renegades
hey hey hey
hey hey hey
living like we're renegades
renegades , renegades
all hail the underdogs
all hail the new kids
all hail the outlaws
spielberg's and kubrick's
it's our time to make a move
it's our time to make amends
it's our time to break the rules
let's begin...
and i say
hey , hey hey hey
living like we're renegades
hey hey hey
hey hey hey
living like we're renegades
renegades , renegades
