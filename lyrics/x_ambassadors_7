i'm nothing but a low life
thinking 'bout my own life
i can't help myself from falling
can't help myself from falling
i'm nothing but a low life
thinking 'bout my own life
i'm trying to fight the good old fight
but after it all , i'm still just a low life
wanna be a better man , but it's a hard life
without that love inside you , it's a cold bind
i started to reflect on all that's been before
started to wonder , but , but you can't be sure
now please tell me i'm broke
it's much easier that way cause i just let you down
it's much easier that way
i'm nothing but a low life
thinking 'bout my own life
i can't help myself from falling
can't help myself from falling
i'm nothing but a low life
thinking 'bout my own life
i'm trying to fight the good old fight
but after it all , i'm still just a low life
there are words in my mind in the candlelight
cold hands on my heart keeping slow time
and i started to reflect on all that's been before
started to wonder , but you , you can't be sure
now please tell me i'm broke
it's much easier that way cause i just let you down
it's much easier that way
i'm nothing but a low life
thinking 'bout my own life
i can't help myself from falling
can't help myself from falling
i'm nothing but a low life
thinking 'bout my own life
i'm trying to fight the good old fight
but after it all , i'm still just a low life
oh , oh , oh , ooooooh
i'm still just a low life
nothing but a low life
i can't help myself from falling
i can't help myself from falling
still just a low life
i'm nothing but a low life
i'm trying to fight the good old fight
but after it all , i'm still just a low life
i'm nothing but a low life ( nothing but a low life )
thinking 'bout my own life ( thinking 'bout my own life )
i can't help myself from falling ( can't help myself )
can't help myself from falling ( can't help myself )
i'm nothing but a low life ( nothing but a low life )
oh , i'm thinking 'bout my own life ( thinking 'bout my own life )
i'm trying to fight the good old fight
but after it all , i'm still just a low life
