feeling overexposed
i wanna be naked with you
all my faults , all your stars
who i am , who you are

no more waiting in the wings

i just wanna say
from my head to my toes
feeling overexposed
i wanna be naked with you
all my faults , all your stars
who i am , who you are
i wanna be... oh , naked with you , naked with you
