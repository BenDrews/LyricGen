i need to sleep more
i need to eat less
i need to work out
i need to de - stress
i need to work hard
i cannot slack off
school & a real job
funds are still not large
enough for me
future is up to me
look up to me
this view is lovely
i swear that , hol up
get back , you lames
so wack , i just
spit facts , how you
hate that , i just
get cash , and blow
that bag , like wait
too fast
like wait
too fast
like wait
too
properties
ain't nobody joking me
remember back in 8th grade
when niggas tried to copy me
ain't no swatting me
i'm something like a pesky flea
you can't get rid of me
poetic shit a part of me
recollecting every property
nothing of poor quality
and these are words of symphony
and this is me collectively
what'chu know about this ?
young nappy headed kid from the 706
tryna make it in this music shit
and i'm faking like i'm happy to amuse the kids
the ones you hate and it's a shame but that's the way it is
put my problems on a boat and then they set adrift
relax myself with metaphors instead of lighting spliffs
learning how to play guitar so i practice rifts
yo
tryna see what i been up to
tryna see who i look up to
tryna steal a couple bucks too
and you know you out of luck too
yeah you know you out of luck too
mas tragam l√∫cifer pra mim
em uma bandeja pra mim
em uma bandeja pra mim
em uma bandeja pra mim
it's too bad your favorite rappers ain't inspired
that's why a nigga came to light the fire
now the game is on my oscar - mayer
i'm the nigga kids admire , labels trying to sign me
speculating my identity , good luck you'll never find me
am i okay ?
well , the question seems rethorical
when i say i'm really dead , my statements metaphorical
i don't quite feel alive
and no i don't quite feel alright
because i'm staying up at night
with all these lyrics that i write
i feel the sensation
my mind is filled with temptation
for a permanent vacation
to an unknown location
you dont know my situation
you hear all of these problems that i'm faced with
but while you listen all your time is being wasted
this is fear , now , can you taste it ?
