do you see that star above the moon ?
yes , the star that we both share
it's the one that leads me home to you
then i pray god leaves it there
for i'm useless as a broken heart without you
and i'm empty as my pockets without you
someday , edmond , you'll be captain
and then i'll be the captain's bride
sooner that you think , mercédès , dear
maybe on this evening's tide
for monsieur morrel has hastened our tomorrow
is it true , mon dieu ?
a captain you shall wed
when love is true
nothing stands in your way
god in his heaven smiles and then
the where and when of stars and men
suddenly fall in place
no one could ask for more
diamonds and rubies can not buy
what will not die is never through
never when love is true
like the wind that fills a sail
true
like a light that will not fail
hold me
let me memorise your face
when i’m lost in your embrace
for eternity
when love is true
true as the star we share
constant and always waiting there
the undertow that won’t let go
now and forever
let it be you i'll see
and let it be no - one but me who
runs to you each time you call
let me be the one who shows you
all love can do
when love is true
