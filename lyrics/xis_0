who's afraid of the dark ?
responsible for the murders in the park
when i bark , they hear the boom , but you see the spark
and i seen the part of your head which used to be your face
was replaced by nothing for bluffing , what a waste
niggas wanna see me taste my own medicine , picture that
get on some old second grade shit , i'ma get you back
retaliate , if it hates for you to think i took a loss
when all i did was shook it off
yeah , you heard me , shook it off
man , if we was up north , niggas would have been fucked you
but then we in the streets , niggas should haven been stuck you
plucked you like a chicken wit' your head cut off
they'll find you wit' your back open and your legs cut off
and as for your man , don't you ever in your mothafuckin' life
know when i gotta gun come at me wit' a knife , a'ight ?
and forgetting you ever saw me is the best thing to do
don't give a fuck about your family , they'll be resting with you
you got yourself in a predicament , that you can't get out of
you already in some shit , but it's about to get hotter
fucking with a nigga like you running your mouth
will , have that same nigga like you , gun in your mouth
but won't be like the last time when you run in the house
cause i ain't knocking on the door
i'm coming in the house
and i'm gunning for your spouse , trying to send the bitch back to her maker
and if you got a daughter older then 15 , i'ma rape her
take her on the living room floor , right there in front of you
then ask you seriously , whatchu wanna do ?
frustrating , isn't it ? when they kill me , but i'ma kill you
now watch me fuck just a little while longer , please , will you ?
this is revenge , no time before you die
and despite how much i hate to see a grown man cry
i'ma make you suffer , see your ass in hell , motherfucker , click , boom - boom
see your ass in hell
when i speak you better listen , the harder it gets , the more follows
and i'm hitting them with shit that they can't all swallow
i keep my slugs hollow , keep families with sorrow
keep motherfuckers like you , not seeing tomorrow
i will borrow a gun , then run 'til i catch you
let you slip up , just once , then i'ma wet you
stretch you out like a limousine
cause where i catch you is where i catch you , that's what killing means
fuck whoever's standing there when you get what you got coming
cause once i hit you in your head , the witnesses start running
niggas started something , but they chose not to finish it
so i'ma wrap it up , for real , dog , cause i'ma winner , shit
fuck it yo , let's end this shit , i don't need the plaques
and i ain't a dj , nigga , so i don't need the wax
gimme slugs from my gats
gimme hoods from my rats
gimme wood from my bats
then they meet where the fuck i'm at , for real
