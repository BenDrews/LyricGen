you know it wasn't all good a few years ago
the fact that i'm here right now is a miracle ( aye )
i just wanna make music for your stereo
but no matter where we go
they hate to see you smile , have a good time
can't fit my shoes , can't walk the miles
they mad at my grind , head in the clouds
i'm on my way though no time to waste
i'm outer space , ain't on my level
we're not the same you can't stop my shine
not today
no not today , no not today , not today
no not today
you won't get me down , not today
no not today , no not today , not today , no not today
you can't stop my shine , not today
no more hot dogs and baked beans
damn dog , you doing great things
and they think they can fill these shoes ?
who ? i don't even know who made these
a little money in my jeans
so i don't got to pose when somebody say cheese
they created a monster
a sleeping giant with an american dream
is it true your step cousins with macklemore ?
i don't know but you stepping on my patrick mohrs
and i've been giving all my money to the pastor lord
i'm trying to make it all back with these tracks and tours , but as soon as i step outside
i can feel the hate before i get in the ride
look at how they mess with ya mind
making money off american genocide
today we ain't taking suggestions
we are more than pedestrians
having a hard time trying to change the world
cause these people can be so negative
i pay the bills with these ted talks
so my adventure time is so excellent
salty as hell so pepperidge
no wonder the bouncer didn't let you in boy
they hate to see you smile , have a good time
can't fit my shoes , can't walk the miles
they mad at my grind , head in the clouds
i'm on my way though no time to waste
i'm outer space , ain't on my level
we're not the same you can't stop my shine
not today
no not today , no not today , not today
no not today
you won't get me down , not today
no not today , no not today , not today , no not today
you can't stop my shine , not today
can't a young black man get comfortable
ooo , in something new ?
getting money off my two cents
too sick , boy you the shit
number 2 with a number 2
aye i bust a move
you know we came to party
but hey , you never know we might save somebody
last year we lost a whole lot of soldiers
salute , god must be making an army
put the gun down , pick a book up and read
then pick the gun back up for your freedom of speech
and tell em' we ain't never going quietly
people praying that they babies gotta enough to eat
so , i put faith in a mustard seed
hustling , trying to escape custody
and while i'm on the subject
middle finger in the air like fuck police
police man , police man , you killing our future
no peace man , no peace man , hands up and they shoot ya
we say black lives , they say all lives
but we just worried about our lives
way too many rips , black blood under cop lights
i'm a thug cause i'm not white
i probably sell drugs on the block right ?
how the hell could we not riot martin ?
everybody ain't non - violent
so i don't listen what they tell me
i'm too busy taking selfies
i'm really feeling myself today
hope i feel the same way next week
the sun is out
left the whip at the crib and i hopped on a ten speed
haters , let em run they mouth and take shots
ha ! you missed me
you know it wasn't all good a few years ago
the fact that i'm here right now is a miracle aye
i just wanna make music for your stereo
but no matter where we go
they hate to see you smile , have a good time
can't fit my shoes , can't walk the miles
they mad at my grind , head in the clouds
i'm on my way though no time to waste
i'm outer space , ain't on my level
we're not the same you can't stop my shine
not today
no not today , no not today , not today
no not today
you won't get me down , not today
no not today , no not today , not today , no not today
you can't stop my shine , not today
