i gotta get you outta my head
and in my bed , baby
make your way into the crib
don't be shy , there's no one here
follow me into a room
ain't no telling what we'll do
just me and you
ain't no telling what we'll do
just you and i
apple jack , new jack , g money style
got a stone in her wrist worth 20 thou

til my next , we're never loving the deuces
i was blessed with a young thing
met me in the city
i'll keep it secret if you let me in your vickie's
just you and i here , ain't no eyes here
everything private til we fly lear
shake that ass in the mirror
going to the club , tight - fitting dress
time to come up out of that..

you gonna love the way i'm hitting , ah !
make your way into the crib
don't be shy , there's no one here
follow me into a room
ain't no telling what we'll do
just me and you
ain't no telling what we'll do

get it poppin in there
throw em all over like a cop in the rear
have em locked in the bed
yeah , skipping the kissing , kissing
your kitten. switching positions
stick the key in ignition
and she ride until she run out of gas
and she a spurter , so literally
she cumming out fast
put my palm on that ass , turn that
waist back around. before i come she
turn her face back around
say i tell that her lay down
open your thighs , til that boy go
back inside
