man , you got it all worked out , don't you ? old pair of shoes
never wear your heart on your sleeve cause it don't go with the suit
you got a bad , bad woman with a young little pretty face
they told you not to go get married
but you went and did it anyway
singin' , oh sweet sounds of american you
never miss a sunday service , never got tattoos
every time we drive by wavin' , i see right through
doo doo doo doo doo doo , fuck you too
mama said steer clear of the devil so you never played in the road
always lookin' on the bright side , so you never see the potholes
you got a house on a hill , big news , that's a big deal
big party with your big time friends , man , imagine how that feels
singin' , oh sweet sounds of american you
never miss a sunday service , never got tattoos
every time we drive by wavin' , i see right through
doo doo doo doo doo doo , fuck you too
i believe in the modest dream , ain't lookin' for a pot of gold
a 6 pack and some good marijuana , i can watch my mama roll
i believe i could buy a few things like a house with a nice pool
invite my nobody friends to the party and weâ€™ll pee in it , fuck you
you got a blue - collar father who drinks budweiser out the bottle
20 dollars , an old impala , a baby's mama
you work hard , you don't beg , you don't borrow
night at the factory , daytime job at mcdonald's
your daddy told you that girl was nothin' but a problem
but you fell in love 'cause to you she was like a supermodel
and they told you not to go get married
but you went and did it anyway
it ain't no problem
you make somethin' out of nothin' , you make money for a livin'
pushin' buttons , diggin' ditches , flippin' burgers in the kitchen
with the vision , you've been dreamin' , you've been savin'
you've been given nothin' but shit
but you take it cause you're patient in this prison
fuck everybody dissin' , it ain't them who gotta live in this skin
with all these tattoos that you got that fuckin' offends them
if it's you that i'm speakin' to , you must be my extension
i take my drink up and sip it , take my hat off and tip it
slumerican
singin' , oh sweet sounds of american you
never miss a sunday service , never got tattoos
every time we drive by wavin' , i see right through
doo doo doo doo doo doo , fuck you too
singin' , oh sweet sounds of american you
never miss a sunday service , never got tattoos
every time we drive by wavin' , i see right through
doo doo doo doo doo doo , fuck you too
