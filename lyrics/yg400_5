it's yg , 400
the flow cold got these hoes' nose runnin'
the rap game a bakery , i'm getting dough from it
and i shop with it , i got something to show from it
i got this white girl , she's like my snow bunny
these niggas choke in they raps , so funny !
it's mr. young gangsta , these niggas so wanksta
like don't sleep on em' , these niggas better wake up
candle lit money , nigga get ya cake up
bullets like makeup , they switch your face up
i'm like an airplane , girl you know what's up
niggas we blowing money quick like we blowing blunts
red chucks like my bitch's lipstick
i'm taking bitches down , like the hit stick
push in an nigga , motherfucker go hard
these niggas baller blocking , i call em' bo gaurds
whatever it is , they're getting it straight
i'm too obsessed , too dedicated , never escape
i ain't scared , i'ma go in , looking like i'm glowing
running on beats , you show me your feet
if you ever be down to flowing
and now , i got a notion , i'm a put this into motion
speeding through the present
trying to get there and coach , man
hopes the dope man will be there soon
for now the music up loud and the beat on smooth
i'm just rhyming , spitting so efficient
keeping the tradition , while seeking to be different
just dropped k.i.d.s. , but i'm a man of many words
you had to do it big , but couldn't never stop the work
now you heard my words so your bubbles gonna burst
yeah we're on third but say what's up to the homies on first
if i can , i'm a kick it , rip it just cause i love it
now they see me , ask me if i can spit it right out in public
hey , yo , rappers got time that they're wasting , hating
when they could focus on their own grind , skating
they mad i got fans and they mad i got love
cause me and music fit like a glove , so snug
all you angry mother fuckers can go on and form a club
cause when you come around me , it ain't nothing but love
i got girls giving hugs , people dapping me up
and you in the corner , like , " oh man , mac sucks ! "
been a long grind and a little bit of luck
feeling blessed everyday for the way i'm coming up
i can promise you this : i ain't even close to done
just pray to god that i'm safe when the soldiers come
they hear me , they forgetting if i'm old or young
got this music on lock , but i open up
all the time , cause my bars and my rhymes be my lifestyle
blowing white clouds , you getting high right now
live from the apple slicing the american pie
with dope lyrics watch me get america high
by your appearance i can get a glimpse of your vibe
they say you are what you wear , i am yves saint laurent
maison martin margiella
catch me at the montreyon fella
i'm getting money thats why you all jealous
this ain't a rap song , this is a rap some
immaculate so i'mma be the first to cast on
in kindergarten i was filling out my tax form
while my other class mates was learning jimmy crack corn ?
how can i go broad , riding shot gun with lupe through chicago hood
hat tilted to the side like a gd
bumping a pac cd
picture me rollin' , holla when you see me
this easy , sorta like my abc's
it'll take em' to the pillar nigga 1 , 2 , 3
know my name when i spell , it's d - i two g's
rather die before i'm telling see i'm too g
diggy !
beatin' up the beat like it's a high school drumline
i got the teachers like " what has he become now ? "
a young genius , homie i'm like and einstein
i'm balling now , we go to belize and i'll shine
no deportion , split the dough in proportions
grown man money these kids partial abortion
go to the mall , they playing round and they horseing
they beef while twizzy be dropping stacks in nordstrom
porky pig pull , but that ain't all folks
i ain't kidding with y'all folks
sound like a kid but i ain't kidding at all though
so don't mistake me
and one more thing : it's young mula baby
