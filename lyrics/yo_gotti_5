started from the ground , building to the sky now
watch it fall down , but how you gon’ survive now ?
yeah , it’s cold blood in a nigga
the streets left no love in a nigga
( in a nigga , yeah , no love in a nigga )
if i could paint a picture , i'd show a image
of a dog ass nigga , yeah , a raw ass nigga
popping pain killers , riding for the cause
four dogs with them pistols , natural born killers
he sold crack to his mother , turned his back on his brothers
killed his partner for the plug , he think everything a hustle
cold mufucka , holmes numb
black heart , no feelings , just a gun
he was raised in the trenches
not to mention all the hoes that had dissed him
so holmes think the whole world against him
played ball , coach benched him
grandpa , klan lynched him
he was raised in mississippi but he moved up to memphis
kinda hard to adapt
so holmes turned to a strap
didn't succeed , tried rap , couldn't fight , got slapped
shot dice , do crap , did time , back out , damn
and from the ground , we build it to the sky now
watch it fall down , how you gon’ survive now ?
it’s cold blood in a nigga
the streets left no love in a nigga
started from the ground , building to the sky now
watch it fall down , how you gon’ survive now ?
yeah , it’s cold blood in a nigga
the streets left no love in a nigga
( hey , no love , no love
how you gon' survive now ? no love , no love
yo gotti , lemme paint a picture for these niggas )
here’s a voice for the voiceless
my words like multiple choice to the choiceless
emerge like a search light in the darkness
for this young , black carcass
my niggas either join the armed forces or they corpses now
in god we trust , but it’s bucks that we worship now
boy , that root of evil gon’ forever rule the people
see , i seen just what that fast money gon’ come and do to people
hit a lick , it was a hit , he said , “let's go and do the sequel”
but his , nigga wasn’t ‘bout it , nigga wasn’t ‘bout it , now
feeling guilty , what would momma think about me ?
told 'em , think about it , nigga , won't you think about it now ?
but he was money hungry , plus he trigger happy
so they hopped up in the caddy , burners packed just like a stadium
thirty minutes later , blood is leaking at the atm
momma in denial , like her baby boy on trial
for a murder that he ain’t commit , tears soak the handkerchief
and from the ground , we build it to the sky now
watch it fall down , how you gon’ survive now ?
it’s cold blood in a nigga
the streets left no love in a nigga
started from the ground , building to the sky now
watch it fall down , how you gon’ survive now ?
yeah , it’s cold blood in a nigga
the streets left no love in a nigga
fo real , fo real
lights off , no candles , roaches all around the kitchen
nigga hungry , mom embarrassed , so she don't want us to mention it
grandma wanna help but momma ego kicking in
she a hustler , she don’t need no help raising her kids
bills came , got evicted , stayed strong
square business , she ain’t never shown weakness , real shit
that created the hunger , and that make the monsters
got the game from our momma , that’s some ill shit
thirteen on the block , he was a lookout
in the kitchen , on the stove like it’s a cookout
young nigga doctored the game , could put a book out
right when he thought it was over he got took out
brains leaking , nigga sneaked him , he ain't even seen it coming
he a hitta , he wasn't focus so he died over nothing
no revenge , with his friends shooting dice
bet again , win or lose , take it all , took out by his own men
they say the good die young , that’s the truth
my nigga floating up in heaven now , and that’s the proof
i ain’t make it to the funeral , but homie rest in peace
if this world get too cold , i hope one day you rescue me
nigga , maybe we can fly someday
oh , we can fly someday
yeah , up in the sky someday
do real niggas get to heaven ? that’s that shit i ask the reverend
