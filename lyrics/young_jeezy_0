smack it up , flip it down , weigh it up , break it down
lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya who’s ya daddy now
ain't even gotta open your eyes , know what your looking at
and i ain't even have to open my eyes when i was cooking that
guess it was love at first sight , eye contact
remember the night we first met , i caught a contact
now she's my ride or die , it’s us against the world
you know we both hustlin’ so hustlin’ is our world
said i must've had too much to drink i’m in my g - mode
so all the ladies repeat after me cause it’s the g - code
promise if i get locked , you’ll come and pay my bond
if you hear some niggas plotting on me , you’ll ring the alarm
and everytime you give it to me it’s gon be the bomb
and in these unlucky streets you’re gon’ be my lucky charm
i said i see some ladies in here tonight i might marry ( marry )
gone off the belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary ( scary )
baby you can have whatever you like , the tooth fairy
i’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you , cherie
i said i do , i do , i do , i do , i do ( you know i do )

honor the code , not bring drama to mama’s peephole
life’s a bitch but she's the only love that i know - ow - ow
so la - a - dee , after the “i do’s” lets do mercedes
lets tie the knot , lets grab us a pot , lets make a baby
looking back , i don’t know who threw this bouquet to me
but i walk down this aisle faithfully , cut that cake for me
i , jay - z , take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
and til the task force roll
to hug her every corner til i get ash from the cold
or until i’ve amassed a fortune , too much cash for me to fold ( fold )
fold under pressure i would never , ever , ever , ever ( ever )
your secret’s i treasure , for better or worse
you’ll always be my first love til death do us part
pull a hearse up , my verse up
i said i see some ladies in here tonight i might marry ( marry )
gone off the belvey and ‘tron it’s too scary ( scary )
baby you can have whatever you like , the tooth fairy
i’ll do anything to leave here tonight with you , cherie
i said i do , i do , i do , i do , i do ( you know i do )
i said i do i do i do i do i do ( you know i do )
i said i do i do i do i do i do ( you know i do )
i said i do i do i do i do i do
( yeah )
nothing's more attractive than a heavy praying woman
to a him when those and them been defecating on me ( ughh )
her would sense the heaven , and him when andre omen
baby i’m hell , save me , don’t bail
crazy i tell you all of this in the middle of a club
where words tend to get thrown around lightly like like , like - like , love
" friend , " " rock star " and " so and so’s a genius "
so him vow to never utter him do unless him mean it
her proud like her mother and ooohh momma’s sweet
so you just know that juicy fruit ain't gon’ fall too far from tree
so if we ever woopty woop
i want all that bleepty bleep
on this nasty carpet bixby fresh on one knee
say i do i do i do i do i do
so we can float up outta here in this hot air balloon
lets put a baby butterfly up in your lil’ cocoon
and maybe 2030 our baby , she’ll be nerdy make the whole club swoon
she'll love books and cook and look just like you
and when she's done being young , she'll dress like you
we'll call her love 22 , she'll tote a 22 , the laser version
