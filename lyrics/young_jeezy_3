that i can run through the city spend this cash with
that i can run through this city spend this cash on
wake up in the morning get my smash on
i don't want much baby egg whites
keep your stomach and your thighs and your legs right
while i’m out here focus getting this bread right
but if the head right , jeezy there every night
wake up in the morning and i'm still here
wake up in the morning and i ain’t gone
all i ask , let me just do me
and maybe just me and you can get along
had them other bitches mad when they seen us
had them matching rolexes baby , team us
yeah the earth is our turf we can share the world
maybe even go half on a baby girl

and when i’m done with the front , hit it from behind

and maybe we can kick it when i got the time
be my back bone every nigga need a spine
gotta know you ride with me if i’m right or wrong
case i wake up in the morning and it’s all gone
best believe i’ma get it right back
thats the hustler in me i know you like that

always talking about she gonna leave me
but she don’t
but maybe this time might be different
cause she shed so many tears

but as soon as we get done , i swear this is all i hear , yeah
