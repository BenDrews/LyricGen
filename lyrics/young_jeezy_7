today was a good day , hope i have me a great night
i don't know what you fishin' for , but catch you a great white

i cannot believe this , who knew it came in bales ?
who knew what came with jail ?
who knew what came with prison ?
just 'cause you got opinions

bush robbed all of us , would that make him a criminal ?
and then he cheated in florida
would that make him a seminole ?

buy all these school shoes , buy all these school clothes
for some strange reason my son addicted to polo's
love me some spinach dip , i'm addicted to houston's
and if the numbers is right i'll take a trip out to houston
an earthquake out in china , a hurricane in new orleans

yeah , our history , black history
no president ever did shit for me
had to hit the streets , had to flip some keys
so a nigga won't go broke
then they put us in jail , now a nigga can't go vote
so i spend dough on these hoes strippin'
she ain't a politician , honey's a pole - itician
my president is black , rose golden charms
22 - inch rims like hulk hogan's arms
when thousands of peoples is riled up to see you
that can arouse your ego
we've got mouths to feed , so
gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
'cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
no matter how big you can ever be
for whatever fee or publicity , never lose your integrity
for years there's been some prize horses in this stable
just two albums in , i'm the realest nigga on this label
mr. black president , yo , obama for real
they gotta put your face on the 5000 dollar bill
my president is black , my lambo's blue
and i'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
my mama ain't at home and daddy's still in jail
tryin' to make a plate , anybody seen the scale ?
my president is black , my lambo's blue
and i'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
my money's light green and my jordans light grey
and they love to see white , now how much you tryin' to pay ?
