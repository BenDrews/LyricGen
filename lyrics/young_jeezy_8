fuck these haters , i’d kill them all if i could
ain't scared of none of y’all , so you know my aim good
blowing bin laden in my porsche 911
just left ground zero , on my way to kush heaven
can’t slow down , too much evil in my rearview
sometimes you wanna scream to god , but he can’t hear you
and even if you did , this’ll probably be his answer :
" fuck you ‘plaining about ? it ain’t like you got cancer "
do it for my niggas on the block that got it worse
first the love , then the hate , that just a trap nigga’s curse
i bet you feel like the whole world hating on you
but what’s the hold up ? the whole world waiting on you
( the fame… )
i wake up and feel empty
shit make you want to squeeze your glock until it’s empty
i’m already standing on the edge , so don’t tempt me
fake motherfuckers envy
you mean to tell me from running my big mouth
that i could chill here in this big penthouse ?
all elevatored up , black hardwood floors
just to sit around and feel like it ain’t yours
your conscience got you feeling like you done something wrong
but the flatscreen saying motherfucker , we on
pardon me , nigga , do you see this view ?
see ruth’s chris from here , what the fuck’s wrong with you ?
looking at my rollie , yeah , it’s almost 7
bill gates state of mind with an automatic weapon
you might remember from putting on for the city
or back when it was on 2 , going for the 50
opened up a few squares , opened up a few tours
just to show niggas keys open up doors
“oh , we don’t fuck with young no more” why not ?
the only thing i can figure , because he on top
( the fame… )
i wake up and feel empty
shit make you want to squeeze your glock until it’s empty
i’m already standing on the edge , so don’t tempt me
fake motherfuckers envy
lately , i been often out of sight , seldom out of mind
ay , getcha bidne’ right , and stay the hell up out of mine
i’m out my mind , tryin’ to fix it ‘fore i’m out of time
don’t worry ’bout me , god got me , bruh , i’m doin’ fine
another year in prison , promise this is it for me
tryna make it through the storm , should be makin’ history
no feelin’ sorry for me , keep ya pity and ya sympathy
good or bad , take it like a man , whatever meant for me
how i did it make ‘em hate my spirit , they wish they could kill it
and they’ll take it however they can get it
wanna see me fulla misery , walkin’ wit’ my head down
“let’s decapitate him , then we’ll see if he can wear his crown”
( the fame… )
i wake up and feel empty
shit make you want to squeeze your glock until it’s empty
i’m already standing on the edge , so don’t tempt me
