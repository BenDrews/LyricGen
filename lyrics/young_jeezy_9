guess who's back ?
still smell the blow in my clothes
like krispy kreme , i was cooking them o's
like horseshoes , i was tossing them o's
time to re - up gotta recycle the flow
i'm emotional ! i hug the block
i'm so emotional ! i love my glock
cash rules everything around me , so what's realer ?
about the scrilla , call me a ghostface killa
it's kinda hard to be drug - free
when georgia power won't give a nigga lights free
switched hustles , been killin' em ever since
it pays to tell the truth , dog , it only makes sense
when they play that new jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
and watch the dope boys go crazy
i pop my collar then i swing my chain
you can catch me in the club , pimping , doing my thang
more than a hustler , i'm the definition of it
master chef , lord of the kitchen cupboard
more than a street legend , homie , it's hova
more than a relief pitcher , i'm the closer
the mariano of the mariott
if money talks , the whole world's about to hear me out
see , i'm a hustler's hope , i'm not his pipe dreams
so when they speak of success , i'm what they might mean
attract money , my worst color is light green
my favorite hue is jay - z blue
don't follow me , young'un , follow my moves , i'm not a role model
my bad influence got the world drinking gold bottles
when puff was in that tub spilling mo'
i was at my video , cris' on the speedboat
" in my lifetime , " nigga , go through your research
st. thomas , my nigga , that was me first
chrome - shoe'd the gs , i came feet - first
in the game like a baby born to breech birth
i got the keys if you need work
i can kingpin you a line , a dime at a time
my niggas love it when i talk like this
my corporate people start buggin' cause i talk like this
the corporate thugs is like " nah hov , talk that shit
the dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy jay - z ! "
see i'ma '80s baby , master of reaganomics
school of hard knocks , every day is college
you ain’t did nothing i ain’t did , nigga pay homage
or pay the doctor , i sprayed lami's
still , the time’ll reveal , you know i’m being honest
ya ain’t pull my coat yet and i keep my shit in coat check
they say the truth shall come to the light
so everybody grab your shades cause your boy that bright
goodnight !
buy 18 the hard way
have a humble nigga thinking about gun play
now who the fuck wanna play with guns ?
a lot of holes , a lot of blood , dog...the shit ain't fun
so i suggest you don't play with my chains
i'll send these hollows atchya , let em play with ya brain
the streets is watching , the name is warm
the product's white , a star is born ( yeah ! )
and i'm so fly , if i take this parachute off , i might fall and die
wrap the work like spandex with the latex
then we ship it out of town , call it safe sex
when they play that new jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
and watch the dope boys go crazy
i pop my collar then i swing my chain
you can catch me in the club , pimping , doing my thang
