he listens to azealia banks
and suddenly because i do he thinks im tryna hang
and suddenly because i do he thinks im ready to bang
and yes i am but only cos i dont think w/ my brain
another white boy quite like me if i may
blogging on tumblr queued up night and day
pictures of black girls scattered in between all the gay
porn and shirtless selfies you dont say
his favoritest blog is ratchet mess
he's got a lot of followers all his friends are impressed
his autoplay's set to liquorice
he's known all the words by heart since when
1 9 9 1 ep released
he was still on pink friday when 212 appeared
but he says confidently that she is the queen
and the other rap bitches ain't shit to me
queen azealia banks queen azealia banks
i really love all of your music i am such a fan
but your other fans especially the stans
some of them are fucking awful queen azealia banks
he's never heard a lil kim song in his life
and who on gods green earth is mc lyte
it doesnt matter , bambi ? best of all time
no clue who you dissed in succubi
not that it really matters it just looks so dumb
and minimizes every kind of music it came from
he listens to you late at night even while he cums
gay porn soundtrack : fuck up the fun

and suddenly because he does he thinks he's part of the fame
and suddenly he has become an expert on the game

but your other fans especially the stans
some of them are fucking awful queen azealia banks
