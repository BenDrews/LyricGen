we should've listened to each other's hearts
fall in love and never part
we can make it happen , if you 'bout that action
now here we go again , here we go again
you know you wanna be my baby
now here we go again , here we go again
you know you wanna be my baby
still we beat , that's how i'm feelin'
let 'em know we in the buildin'
from the floor up to the ceilin'

doing movement , we can party
who’s in our business ? everybody
but it’s alright , cause i’m still living

lemme tell you little somethin' , little somethin'
that you might wanna know 'bout me

lemme tell you little somethin' , little somethin'
that you might wanna know 'bout me
