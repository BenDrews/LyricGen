whenever i was frightened or ever felt alone
i turned to the night sky at a star i call my own
somewhere i could run to , just across the milky way
if you like , i could take you
it's just a lightyear and a day
we can sail away tonight on a sea of pure moonlight
we can navigate the stars to bring us back home
in a place so far away
we'll be young , that's how we'll stay
every wish is our command
when we find ourselves in never , neverland
through all my make believe , there's some reality
in your reflection there's much more than you see , yeah !
all that you hope for , you hope for today
it's the love someone gives you in an unconditional way
we can sail away tonight on a sea of pure moonlight
we can navigate the stars to bring us back home
in a place so far away
we'll be young , that's how we'll stay
every wish is our command
when we find ourselves in never , neverland
picture a land you'll never have seen
where life is eternal and evergreen
future of happiness all in your hands
all in this place i created that i call neverland
we can sail away tonight on a sea of pure moonlight
we can navigate the stars to bring us back home
in a place so far away
we'll be young , that's how we'll stay
and with your hand in my hand
i am closer now to finding neverland
and with your hand in my hand
i am closer now to finding neverland
