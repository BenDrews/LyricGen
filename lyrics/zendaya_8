sparks turn to flames
when hearts start to chase
you'll fall if you run , right into the smoke
the lights start to dim when it's almost enough
but flames light this place
fireflies tonight
cause love , lights the sky ( hey , yeah ! )
so , put it up in , put it up in the air
put it up in , put love in the air
so , put it up in , put it up in the air
put it up in , put love in the air
baby , it's only right that you share
pass the love , and put it in the atmoshpere
( here we go )
if you want keep it warm , living in the air
just keep your rotation so the clouds go nowhere
just please light this place , woah - woah - woah - woah
fireflies tonight
cause love , lights the sky ( hey , yeah ! )
so , put it up in , put it up in the air
put it up in , put love in the air
so , put it up in , put it up in the air
put it up in , put love in the air
so , put it up in , put it up in the air
put it up in , put love in the air
so , put it up in , put it up in the air
put it up in , put love in the air
let it burn , burn
let it burn , burn
let it burn , burn
let it burn , burn
fireflies tonight
cause love , lights the sky
so , put it up in , put it up in the air
put it up in , put love in the air
so , put it up in , put it up in the air
put it up in , put love in the air
so , put it up in , put it up in the air
put it up in , put love in the air
so , put it up in , put it up in the air
put it up in , put love in the air
