i got ten fingers to the sky
my back to the wall , my white flag high
hair , lips , just like a gun
she’s got silver bullets on that tongue
he’s deep under her spell
i’m screaming out but it just won’t help
i think i’m cursed , i had him first
oh adeline , have mercy , you don’t wanna break my heart
take what’s mine , don’t hurt me , steal my money , steal my car
don’t take my man , don’t take my man , i said don’t take my man
‘cause you know you can , put the gun down ooh , put the gun down ooh
she stole my man , took him from me
she’s got crimson eyes , a screaming body
face is young , she must taste sweet
she drops those panties to her knees
walking on my happy home
she won’t give up until i’m gone
i think i’m cursed , i had him first
oh adeline , have mercy , you don’t wanna break my heart
take what’s mine , don’t hurt me , steal my money , steal my car
don’t take my man , don’t take my man , i said don’t take my man
‘cause you know you can , put the gun down ooh , put the gun down ooh
put the gun down , put the gun down
put your finger on the trigger now
put it down , put it down , put it down , put it down
put the gun down , put the gun down
i’mma set fire to the whole damn house
put it down , put it down , put it down , put it down , whoa , adeline
adeline , have mercy , you don’t wanna break my heart
take what’s mine , don’t hurt me , steal my money , steal my car
don’t take my man , don’t take my man , i said don’t take my man
‘cause you know you can , put the gun down ooh , put the gun down ooh
put gun down ooh , put the gun down ooh , put the gun down
