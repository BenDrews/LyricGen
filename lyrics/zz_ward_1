your clothes out on the blacktop , scattered suits on the street
frames and broken pictures in the mid - september heat
we set these nights on fire , so hot , we burned it down
now all that’s left of us is ashes on the ground
i told you back in june , you knew damn well what i would do
365 days , you’ve been making me wait
so keep your two - timing games , it’s a lot of too late
the summer’s over , over , over , over , over , over
drop your keys from six stories , shout out , “it’s raining green”
don’t tell lies in heaven or an angel will get mean
diamonds and white gold watches , watch how fast they will soar
you always say you wanted to give back to the poor
i told you back in june , you knew damn well what i would do
i won’t be your debutante , won’t be the fool to your savant
i can’t fix your cracked up dreams while the leaves fall off these trees
i won’t spend the winter nights holding on to what ain’t right
you might break your words real fast but mine are made to last.
365 days , you’ve been making me wait
so keep your two - timing games , it’s a lot of too late
the summer’s over , over , over , over , over , over
365 days , you’ve been making me wait
so keep your two - timing games , it’s a lot of too late
the summer’s over , over , over , over , over now , over now
