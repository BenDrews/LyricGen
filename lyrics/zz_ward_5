mmm , i want you in my bed in a minute flat
let’s hit the backseat of your cherry cadillac
i bet you never guessed or came prepared for this
i like your bowtie , the glasses on your eyes
you better push that gear down to the fifth
and hit that gas pedal with a hell of a kick
i wanna feel the heat , your tires grip that street
i like your straight a style , can’t wait another mile
whoa , the world ain’t ending but it might as well be
whoa , i’ll rock you like the sea
buildings ain’t crumbling but they might as well be
whoa , so let’s not think and just move like you stole it
move , hurry , move like you stole it , make your move on me
i see your hands start trembling when i touch you there
i watch your jaw drop open with an eager stare
i’ll be your dream tonight , your wish has come to life
don’t wanna change my mind so don’t you take your time
you better do it like it’s twenty five to life
two steps from the yard , one man behind bars
move on , move on , move on me
better get your move on like you stole something
you better do it like the sky just caught on fire
take me in your arms , ring the alarm
move on , move on , move on me
better get your move on like you stole something
whoa , the world ain’t ending but it might as well be
whoa , i’ll rock you like the sea
buildings ain’t crumbling but they might as well be
whoa , so let’s not think and just move like you stole it
move , hurry , move like you stole it
make your move on me , move like you stole it
make your move on me , make your move on me
