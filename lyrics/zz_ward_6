it was the coldest night of the year
snow - covered street lamps and belvedere
the moon was just a sliver , the light was fading
the war was on its way and we were waiting
you asked me how long i'd stay by your side
so i answered with only just one reply
til the casket drops , til my dying day
til my heartbeat stops , til my legs just break
whoa , oh , whoa , whoa , whoa , oh
whoa , whoa , oh , til the casket drops
a house made out of glass will surely shatter
so we built a fortress of red bricks and ladders
the ground , it started shaking , the bombs are falling
we could've walked away , we had a warning
you asked me how long i'd stay by your side
so i answered with only just one reply
so lay your burden down , baby
lead me out the door
we can't escape this ricochet
i'm ready for this war
so lay your burden down , baby
lead me out the door
we can't escape this ricochet
i'm ready for this war
til the casket drops , til my dying day
til my heartbeat stops , til my legs just break
til the casket drops , til my dying day
til my heartbeat stops , til my legs just break
whoa , oh , whoa , whoa , whoa , oh
whoa , whoa , oh , till the casket drops
