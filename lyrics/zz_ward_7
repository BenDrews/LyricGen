lonely
lonely
i gave you every single thing i possibly can
i tried to spell it out , but you just don't understand
the mornings are the hardest 'cause i don't ever sleep
when it's like you're not even here lying next to me
what do i , what do i , what do i do now ?
baby , it's like you've been gone
without you , without you , without you , darling
i wouldn't feel so alone
let the rain fall down on me
oh , lord , i'm so lonely
black clouds keep calling
oh , have mercy on me
let the rain fall down on me
oh , lord , just set me free
i keep chasing this glory
oh , lord , i'm so lonely
i chase you like a dream that's always running away
how is it i love something that i fucking hate ?
every time i feel like i'ma figure it out
you play me like a fool and watch me drown in my doubt
let the rain fall down on me
oh , lord , i'm so lonely
black clouds keep calling
oh , have mercy on me
let the rain fall down on me
oh , lord , just set me free
i keep chasing this glory
oh , lord , i'm so lonely
lonely
lonely
lonely
lonely
oh , i'm so lonely , it's hard to believe
in over my head , i'm down on my knees
oh , i'm so lonely , and how could this be ?
as long as my blood's been , my heart's gonna beat
so hold me , darling , oh , why can't you see ?
without your touch , i might as well up and leave
hold me , darling , or just let me go
if i'm so lonely , might as well be alone
i'm so lonely
i'm so lonely
i'm so lonely
( hold me )
let the rain fall down on me
oh , lord , i'm so lonely
black clouds keep calling
oh , have mercy on me
let the rain fall down on me
oh , lord , just set me free
i keep chasing this glory
oh , lord , i'm so lonely
