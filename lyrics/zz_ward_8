i don’t need another taste of your lips
to know i’m home when we’re lying here like this
the world could end today , the sun could just fall
here in this bed we made , we’re safe from it all
when nobody believes me , i know you will
when nobody can reach me , i know you will
when nobody can please me , i know you will , whoa
you get me , you get me , whoa
you get me , you get me , whoa
with you , i know i’m home
we don’t need my father to give his blessing
we don’t match on paper but it don’t mean a thing
when all my walls cave in , you pull me through it
when there’s a gun at me , you’d take the bullet
i’m crazy , i get mean but baby , you adore me
shut it down , i get mine , my soldier right by side
my fire , you feed it , give it to me when i need it
i’m all yours so take me , good god , this love’s amazing
when nobody believes me , i know you will
when nobody can reach me , i know you will
when nobody can please me , i know you will , whoa
you get me , you get me , whoa
you get me , you get me , whoa
you get me , you get me , whoa
you get me , you get me , whoa
with you , i know i’m home
with you , i know i’m home
