we were never the marrying type , oh no
we won't buy dishes or stained glass lights , oh no
for a table we'll never sit at
in the house that we won't ever get
i won't wake up and pick out your tie , oh no
you won't come home and kiss me at night , oh no
we won't lie in this king bed for two
say goodbye to us saying " i do's "
no more white picket fences
no more lace veils or vows
no more , " you're the only one " cause that's all done with now
this is the last love song i'll ever write for you
this is the last love song i'll ever write for you
take these roses and this jameson , oh no
find a subway that i can sit in , oh no
buy a one - way out of the city
everything that i need , got it with me
no more white picket fences
no more lace veils or vows
no more , " you're the only one " cause that's all done with now
this is the last love song i'll ever write for you
this is the last love song i'll ever write for you
all these notes and all these words
are all that's left in me
bend these pages , count my woes
one last song to set me free
no more white picket fences
no more lace veils or vows
no more , " you're the only one " cause that's all done with now
this is the last love song i'll ever write for you
this is the last love song i'll ever write for you
this is the last love song i'll ever write for you
this is the last love song i'll ever write for you , oh
